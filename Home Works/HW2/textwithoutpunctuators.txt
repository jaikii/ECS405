chapter i


emma woodhouse  handsome  clever  and rich  with a comfortable home
and happy disposition  seemed to unite some of the best blessings
of existence  and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world
with very little to distress or vex her 

she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate 
indulgent father  and had  in consequence of her sister s marriage 
been mistress of his house from a very early period   her mother
had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct
remembrance of her caresses  and her place had been supplied
by an excellent woman as governess  who had fallen little short
of a mother in affection 

sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr  woodhouse s family 
less as a governess than a friend  very fond of both daughters 
but particularly of emma   between  them  it was more the intimacy
of sisters   even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal
office of governess  the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed
her to impose any restraint  and the shadow of authority being
now long passed away  they had been living together as friend and
friend very mutually attached  and emma doing just what she liked 
highly esteeming miss taylor s judgment  but directed chiefly by
her own 

the real evils  indeed  of emma s situation were the power of having
rather too much her own way  and a disposition to think a little
too well of herself  these were the disadvantages which threatened
alloy to her many enjoyments   the danger  however  was at present
so unperceived  that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes
with her 

sorrow came  a gentle sorrow  but not at all in the shape of any
disagreeable consciousness   miss taylor married   it was miss
taylor s loss which first brought grief   it was on the wedding day
of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought
of any continuance   the wedding over  and the bride people gone 
her father and herself were left to dine together  with no prospect
of a third to cheer a long evening   her father composed himself
to sleep after dinner  as usual  and she had then only to sit
and think of what she had lost 

the event had every promise of happiness for her friend   mr  weston
was a man of unexceptionable character  easy fortune  suitable age 
and pleasant manners  and there was some satisfaction in considering
with what self denying  generous friendship she had always wished
and promoted the match  but it was a black morning s work for her 
the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day 
she recalled her past kindness  the kindness  the affection of sixteen
years  how she had taught and how she had played with her from five
years old  how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse
her in health  and how nursed her through the various illnesses
of childhood   a large debt of gratitude was owing here  but the
intercourse of the last seven years  the equal footing and perfect
unreserve which had soon followed isabella s marriage  on their
being left to each other  was yet a dearer  tenderer recollection 
she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed  intelligent 
well informed  useful  gentle  knowing all the ways of the family 
interested in all its concerns  and peculiarly interested in herself 
in every pleasure  every scheme of hers  one to whom she could speak
every thought as it arose  and who had such an affection for her
as could never find fault 

how was she to bear the change   it was true that her friend was
going only half a mile from them  but emma was aware that great must
be the difference between a mrs  weston  only half a mile from them 
and a miss taylor in the house  and with all her advantages 
natural and domestic  she was now in great danger of suffering
from intellectual solitude   she dearly loved her father  but he
was no companion for her   he could not meet her in conversation 
rational or playful 

the evil of the actual disparity in their ages  and mr  woodhouse had
not married early  was much increased by his constitution and habits 
for having been a valetudinarian all his life  without activity
of mind or body  he was a much older man in ways than in years 
and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart
and his amiable temper  his talents could not have recommended him
at any time 

her sister  though comparatively but little removed by matrimony 
being settled in london  only sixteen miles off  was much beyond
her daily reach  and many a long october and november evening must
be struggled through at hartfield  before christmas brought the next
visit from isabella and her husband  and their little children 
to fill the house  and give her pleasant society again 

highbury  the large and populous village  almost amounting to a town 
to which hartfield  in spite of its separate lawn  and shrubberies 
and name  did really belong  afforded her no equals   the woodhouses
were first in consequence there   all looked up to them   she had
many acquaintance in the place  for her father was universally civil 
but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss
taylor for even half a day   it was a melancholy change  and emma
could not but sigh over it  and wish for impossible things 
till her father awoke  and made it necessary to be cheerful 
his spirits required support   he was a nervous man  easily depressed 
fond of every body that he was used to  and hating to part with them 
hating change of every kind   matrimony  as the origin of change 
was always disagreeable  and he was by no means yet reconciled
to his own daughter s marrying  nor could ever speak of her but
with compassion  though it had been entirely a match of affection 
when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too  and from
his habits of gentle selfishness  and of being never able to
suppose that other people could feel differently from himself 
he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad
a thing for herself as for them  and would have been a great deal
happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield 
emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could  to keep him
from such thoughts  but when tea came  it was impossible for him
not to say exactly as he had said at dinner 

 poor miss taylor   i wish she were here again   what a pity it
is that mr  weston ever thought of her  

 i cannot agree with you  papa  you know i cannot   mr  weston is such
a good humoured  pleasant  excellent man  that he thoroughly deserves
a good wife   and you would not have had miss taylor live with us
for ever  and bear all my odd humours  when she might have a house of her own  

 a house of her own   but where is the advantage of a house of her own 
this is three times as large   and you have never any odd humours 
my dear  

 how often we shall be going to see them  and they coming to see
us   we shall be always meeting   we  must begin  we must go and pay
wedding visit very soon  

 my dear  how am i to get so far  randalls is such a distance 
i could not walk half so far  

 no  papa  nobody thought of your walking   we must go in the carriage 
to be sure  

 the carriage  but james will not like to put the horses to for
such a little way   and where are the poor horses to be while we
are paying our visit  

 they are to be put into mr  weston s stable  papa   you know we
have settled all that already   we talked it all over with mr  weston
last night   and as for james  you may be very sure he will always like
going to randalls  because of his daughter s being housemaid there 
i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else   that was
your doing  papa   you got hannah that good place   nobody thought
of hannah till you mentioned her  james is so obliged to you  

 i am very glad i did think of her   it was very lucky  for i would
not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account 
and i am sure she will make a very good servant  she is a civil 
pretty spoken girl  i have a great opinion of her   whenever i see her 
she always curtseys and asks me how i do  in a very pretty manner 
and when you have had her here to do needlework  i observe she
always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it 
i am sure she will be an excellent servant  and it will be a great
comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is
used to see   whenever james goes over to see his daughter  you know 
she will be hearing of us   he will be able to tell her how we
all are  

emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas 
and hoped  by the help of backgammon  to get her father tolerably
through the evening  and be attacked by no regrets but her own 
the backgammon table was placed  but a visitor immediately afterwards
walked in and made it unnecessary 

mr  knightley  a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty  was not
only a very old and intimate friend of the family  but particularly
connected with it  as the elder brother of isabella s husband 
he lived about a mile from highbury  was a frequent visitor 
and always welcome  and at this time more welcome than usual 
as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london   he had
returned to a late dinner  after some days  absence  and now walked
up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square 
it was a happy circumstance  and animated mr  woodhouse for some time 
mr  knightley had a cheerful manner  which always did him good 
and his many inquiries after  poor isabella  and her children were
answered most satisfactorily   when this was over  mr  woodhouse
gratefully observed   it is very kind of you  mr  knightley  to come
out at this late hour to call upon us   i am afraid you must have
had a shocking walk  

 not at all  sir   it is a beautiful moonlight night  and so mild
that i must draw back from your great fire  

 but you must have found it very damp and dirty   i wish you may
not catch cold  

 dirty  sir  look at my shoes   not a speck on them  

 well  that is quite surprising  for we have had a vast deal
of rain here   it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour
while we were at breakfast   i wanted them to put off the wedding  

 by the bye  i have not wished you joy   being pretty well aware
of what sort of joy you must both be feeling  i have been in no hurry
with my congratulations  but i hope it all went off tolerably well 
how did you all behave  who cried most  

 ah  poor miss taylor   tis a sad business  

 poor mr  and miss woodhouse  if you please  but i cannot possibly
say  poor miss taylor   i have a great regard for you and emma 
but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence   at
any rate  it must be better to have only one to please than two  

 especially when  one  of those two is such a fanciful  troublesome creature  
said emma playfully    that is what you have in your head 
i know  and what you would certainly say if my father were not by  

 i believe it is very true  my dear  indeed   said mr  woodhouse 
with a sigh    i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome  

 my dearest papa  you do not think i could mean  you   or suppose
mr  knightley to mean  you    what a horrible idea  oh no  i meant
only myself   mr  knightley loves to find fault with me  you know  
in a joke  it is all a joke   we always say what we like to one another  

mr  knightley  in fact  was one of the few people who could see
faults in emma woodhouse  and the only one who ever told her of them 
and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself 
she knew it would be so much less so to her father  that she would
not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being
thought perfect by every body 

 emma knows i never flatter her   said mr  knightley   but i
meant no reflection on any body   miss taylor has been used
to have two persons to please  she will now have but one 
the chances are that she must be a gainer  

 well   said emma  willing to let it pass   you want to hear
about the wedding  and i shall be happy to tell you  for we all
behaved charmingly   every body was punctual  every body in their
best looks  not a tear  and hardly a long face to be seen   oh no 
we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart 
and were sure of meeting every day  

 dear emma bears every thing so well   said her father 
 but  mr  knightley  she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor 
and i am sure she  will  miss her more than she thinks for  

emma turned away her head  divided between tears and smiles 
 it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion  
said mr  knightley    we should not like her so well as we do  sir 
if we could suppose it  but she knows how much the marriage is to
miss taylor s advantage  she knows how very acceptable it must be 
at miss taylor s time of life  to be settled in a home of her own 
and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision 
and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure 
every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily
married  

 and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me   said emma 
 and a very considerable one  that i made the match myself 
i made the match  you know  four years ago  and to have it take place 
and be proved in the right  when so many people said mr  weston would
never marry again  may comfort me for any thing  

mr  knightley shook his head at her   her father fondly replied 
 ah  my dear  i wish you would not make matches and foretell things 
for whatever you say always comes to pass   pray do not make any
more matches  

 i promise you to make none for myself  papa  but i must  indeed 
for other people   it is the greatest amusement in the world  and
after such success  you know   every body said that mr  weston would
never marry again   oh dear  no  mr  weston  who had been a widower
so long  and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife 
so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his
friends here  always acceptable wherever he went  always cheerful  
mr  weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did
not like it   oh no  mr  weston certainly would never marry again 
some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed 
and others of the son and the uncle not letting him   all manner
of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject  but i believed none
of it 

 ever since the day  about four years ago  that miss taylor and i
met with him in broadway lane  when  because it began to drizzle 
he darted away with so much gallantry  and borrowed two umbrellas
for us from farmer mitchell s  i made up my mind on the subject 
i planned the match from that hour  and when such success has blessed
me in this instance  dear papa  you cannot think that i shall leave
off match making  

 i do not understand what you mean by  success    said mr  knightley 
 success supposes endeavour   your time has been properly and
delicately spent  if you have been endeavouring for the last four
years to bring about this marriage   a worthy employment for a young
lady s mind  but if  which i rather imagine  your making the match 
as you call it  means only your planning it  your saying to yourself
one idle day   i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor
if mr  weston were to marry her   and saying it again to yourself
every now and then afterwards  why do you talk of success  where
is your merit  what are you proud of  you made a lucky guess 
and  that  is all that can be said  

 and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess   
i pity you   i thought you cleverer  for  depend upon it a lucky
guess is never merely luck   there is always some talent in it 
and as to my poor word  success   which you quarrel with  i do not
know that i am so entirely without any claim to it   you have drawn
two pretty pictures  but i think there may be a third  a something
between the do nothing and the do all  if i had not promoted mr  weston s
visits here  and given many little encouragements  and smoothed
many little matters  it might not have come to any thing after all 
i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that  

 a straightforward  open hearted man like weston  and a rational 
unaffected woman like miss taylor  may be safely left to manage their
own concerns   you are more likely to have done harm to yourself 
than good to them  by interference  

 emma never thinks of herself  if she can do good to others  
rejoined mr  woodhouse  understanding but in part    but  my dear 
pray do not make any more matches  they are silly things  and break up
one s family circle grievously  

 only one more  papa  only for mr  elton   poor mr  elton  you
like mr  elton  papa   i must look about for a wife for him 
there is nobody in highbury who deserves him  and he has been
here a whole year  and has fitted up his house so comfortably 
that it would be a shame to have him single any longer  and i thought
when he was joining their hands to day  he looked so very much as if
he would like to have the same kind office done for him  i think
very well of mr  elton  and this is the only way i have of doing
him a service  

 mr  elton is a very pretty young man  to be sure  and a very
good young man  and i have a great regard for him   but if you
want to shew him any attention  my dear  ask him to come
and dine with us some day   that will be a much better thing 
i dare say mr  knightley will be so kind as to meet him  

 with a great deal of pleasure  sir  at any time   said mr  knightley 
laughing   and i agree with you entirely  that it will be a much
better thing   invite him to dinner  emma  and help him to the best
of the fish and the chicken  but leave him to chuse his own wife 
depend upon it  a man of six or seven and twenty can take care
of himself  



chapter ii


mr  weston was a native of highbury  and born of a respectable family 
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into
gentility and property   he had received a good education  but 
on succeeding early in life to a small independence  had become
indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers
were engaged  and had satisfied an active  cheerful mind and social
temper by entering into the militia of his county  then embodied 

captain weston was a general favourite  and when the chances
of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill 
of a great yorkshire family  and miss churchill fell in love
with him  nobody was surprized  except her brother and his wife 
who had never seen him  and who were full of pride and importance 
which the connexion would offend 

miss churchill  however  being of age  and with the full command
of her fortune  though her fortune bore no proportion to the
family estate  was not to be dissuaded from the marriage  and it
took place  to the infinite mortification of mr  and mrs  churchill 
who threw her off with due decorum   it was an unsuitable connexion 
and did not produce much happiness   mrs  weston ought to have found
more in it  for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper
made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness
of being in love with him  but though she had one sort of spirit 
she had not the best   she had resolution enough to pursue
her own will in spite of her brother  but not enough to refrain
from unreasonable regrets at that brother s unreasonable anger 
nor from missing the luxuries of her former home   they lived beyond
their income  but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe 
she did not cease to love her husband  but she wanted at once
to be the wife of captain weston  and miss churchill of enscombe 

captain weston  who had been considered  especially by the churchills 
as making such an amazing match  was proved to have much the worst
of the bargain  for when his wife died  after a three years  marriage 
he was rather a poorer man than at first  and with a child to maintain 
from the expense of the child  however  he was soon relieved 
the boy had  with the additional softening claim of a lingering
illness of his mother s  been the means of a sort of reconciliation 
and mr  and mrs  churchill  having no children of their own 
nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for  offered to
take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease 
some scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed
to have felt  but as they were overcome by other considerations 
the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills 
and he had only his own comfort to seek  and his own situation to
improve as he could 

a complete change of life became desirable   he quitted the militia
and engaged in trade  having brothers already established in a
good way in london  which afforded him a favourable opening 
it was a concern which brought just employment enough   he had still
a small house in highbury  where most of his leisure days were spent 
and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society 
the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away 
he had  by that time  realised an easy competence  enough to secure
the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury  which he had
always longed for  enough to marry a woman as portionless even
as miss taylor  and to live according to the wishes of his own
friendly and social disposition 

it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence
his schemes  but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth
on youth  it had not shaken his determination of never settling
till he could purchase randalls  and the sale of randalls was long
looked forward to  but he had gone steadily on  with these objects
in view  till they were accomplished   he had made his fortune 
bought his house  and obtained his wife  and was beginning a new
period of existence  with every probability of greater happiness
than in any yet passed through   he had never been an unhappy man 
his own temper had secured him from that  even in his first marriage 
but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly
amiable woman could be  and must give him the pleasantest proof
of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen 
to excite gratitude than to feel it 

he had only himself to please in his choice  his fortune was
his own  for as to frank  it was more than being tacitly brought
up as his uncle s heir  it had become so avowed an adoption
as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age 
it was most unlikely  therefore  that he should ever want his
father s assistance   his father had no apprehension of it 
the aunt was a capricious woman  and governed her husband entirely 
but it was not in mr  weston s nature to imagine that any caprice
could be strong enough to affect one so dear  and  as he believed 
so deservedly dear   he saw his son every year in london 
and was proud of him  and his fond report of him as a very fine
young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too 
he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his
merits and prospects a kind of common concern 

mr  frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury  and a lively
curiosity to see him prevailed  though the compliment was so little
returned that he had never been there in his life   his coming
to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved 

now  upon his father s marriage  it was very generally proposed 
as a most proper attention  that the visit should take place 
there was not a dissentient voice on the subject  either when
mrs  perry drank tea with mrs  and miss bates  or when mrs  and
miss bates returned the visit   now was the time for mr  frank
churchill to come among them  and the hope strengthened when it was
understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion 
for a few days  every morning visit in highbury included some mention
of the handsome letter mrs  weston had received    i suppose you
have heard of the handsome letter mr  frank churchill has written
to mrs  weston  i understand it was a very handsome letter  indeed 
mr  woodhouse told me of it   mr  woodhouse saw the letter  and he
says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life  

it was  indeed  a highly prized letter   mrs  weston had  of course 
formed a very favourable idea of the young man  and such a pleasing
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense 
and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression
of congratulation which her marriage had already secured   she felt
herself a most fortunate woman  and she had lived long enough
to know how fortunate she might well be thought  where the only
regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship
for her had never cooled  and who could ill bear to part with her 

she knew that at times she must be missed  and could not think 
without pain  of emma s losing a single pleasure  or suffering
an hour s ennui  from the want of her companionableness  but dear
emma was of no feeble character  she was more equal to her situation
than most girls would have been  and had sense  and energy 
and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily
through its little difficulties and privations   and then there was
such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield 
so convenient for even solitary female walking  and in mr  weston s
disposition and circumstances  which would make the approaching
season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the
week together 

her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude
to mrs  weston  and of moments only of regret  and her
satisfaction  her more than satisfaction  her cheerful enjoyment 
was so just and so apparent  that emma  well as she knew her father 
was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity
 poor miss taylor   when they left her at randalls in the centre
of every domestic comfort  or saw her go away in the evening
attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own 
but never did she go without mr  woodhouse s giving a gentle sigh 
and saying   ah  poor miss taylor  she would be very glad to stay  

there was no recovering miss taylor  nor much likelihood of
ceasing to pity her  but a few weeks brought some alleviation
to mr  woodhouse   the compliments of his neighbours were over 
he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event 
and the wedding cake  which had been a great distress to him 
was all eat up   his own stomach could bear nothing rich  and he
could never believe other people to be different from himself 
what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body 
and he had  therefore  earnestly tried to dissuade them from having
any wedding cake at all  and when that proved vain  as earnestly
tried to prevent any body s eating it   he had been at the pains
of consulting mr  perry  the apothecary  on the subject   mr  perry
was an intelligent  gentlemanlike man  whose frequent visits were one
of the comforts of mr  woodhouse s life  and upon being applied to 
he could not but acknowledge  though it seemed rather against the
bias of inclination  that wedding cake might certainly disagree
with many  perhaps with most people  unless taken moderately 
with such an opinion  in confirmation of his own  mr  woodhouse hoped
to influence every visitor of the newly married pair  but still the
cake was eaten  and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till
it was all gone 

there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys
being seen with a slice of mrs  weston s wedding cake in their
hands  but mr  woodhouse would never believe it 



chapter iii


mr  woodhouse was fond of society in his own way   he liked very much
to have his friends come and see him  and from various united causes 
from his long residence at hartfield  and his good nature 
from his fortune  his house  and his daughter  he could command the
visits of his own little circle  in a great measure  as he liked 
he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle 
his horror of late hours  and large dinner parties  made him unfit
for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms 
fortunately for him  highbury  including randalls in the same parish 
and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining  the seat of mr  knightley 
comprehended many such   not unfrequently  through emma s persuasion 
he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him  but evening
parties were what he preferred  and  unless he fancied himself at any
time unequal to company  there was scarcely an evening in the week
in which emma could not make up a card table for him 

real  long standing regard brought the westons and mr  knightley 
and by mr  elton  a young man living alone without liking it 
the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude
for the elegancies and society of mr  woodhouse s drawing room 
and the smiles of his lovely daughter  was in no danger of being
thrown away 

after these came a second set  among the most come at able
of whom were mrs  and miss bates  and mrs  goddard  three ladies
almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield 
and who were fetched and carried home so often  that mr  woodhouse
thought it no hardship for either james or the horses   had it
taken place only once a year  it would have been a grievance 

mrs  bates  the widow of a former vicar of highbury  was a
very old lady  almost past every thing but tea and quadrille 
she lived with her single daughter in a very small way  and was
considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady 
under such untoward circumstances  can excite   her daughter enjoyed
a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young 
handsome  rich  nor married   miss bates stood in the very worst
predicament in the world for having much of the public favour 
and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself 
or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect 
she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness   her youth
had passed without distinction  and her middle of life was devoted
to the care of a failing mother  and the endeavour to make a small
income go as far as possible   and yet she was a happy woman 
and a woman whom no one named without good will   it was her own
universal good will and contented temper which worked such wonders 
she loved every body  was interested in every body s happiness 
quicksighted to every body s merits  thought herself a most fortunate
creature  and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother 
and so many good neighbours and friends  and a home that wanted
for nothing   the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature 
her contented and grateful spirit  were a recommendation to every body 
and a mine of felicity to herself   she was a great talker upon
little matters  which exactly suited mr  woodhouse  full of trivial
communications and harmless gossip 

mrs  goddard was the mistress of a school  not of a seminary 
or an establishment  or any thing which professed  in long sentences of
refined nonsense  to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality 
upon new principles and new systems  and where young ladies for
enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity  but
a real  honest  old fashioned boarding school  where a reasonable
quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price 
and where girls might be sent to be out of the way  and scramble
themselves into a little education  without any danger of coming
back prodigies   mrs  goddard s school was in high repute  and
very deservedly  for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy
spot  she had an ample house and garden  gave the children plenty
of wholesome food  let them run about a great deal in the summer 
and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands 
it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked
after her to church   she was a plain  motherly kind of woman 
who had worked hard in her youth  and now thought herself entitled
to the occasional holiday of a tea visit  and having formerly
owed much to mr  woodhouse s kindness  felt his particular claim
on her to leave her neat parlour  hung round with fancy work 
whenever she could  and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside 

these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently
able to collect  and happy was she  for her father s sake 
in the power  though  as far as she was herself concerned 
it was no remedy for the absence of mrs  weston   she was delighted
to see her father look comfortable  and very much pleased with
herself for contriving things so well  but the quiet prosings
of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent
was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated 

as she sat one morning  looking forward to exactly such a close
of the present day  a note was brought from mrs  goddard  requesting 
in most respectful terms  to be allowed to bring miss smith with her 
a most welcome request  for miss smith was a girl of seventeen 
whom emma knew very well by sight  and had long felt an interest in 
on account of her beauty   a very gracious invitation was returned 
and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion 

harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody   somebody had
placed her  several years back  at mrs  goddard s school 
and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar
to that of parlour boarder  this was all that was generally known
of her history   she had no visible friends but what had been
acquired at highbury  and was now just returned from a long visit
in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her 

she was a very pretty girl  and her beauty happened to be of a sort
which emma particularly admired   she was short  plump  and fair 
with a fine bloom  blue eyes  light hair  regular features 
and a look of great sweetness  and  before the end of the evening 
emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person  and quite
determined to continue the acquaintance 

she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith s
conversation  but she found her altogether very engaging  not
inconveniently shy  not unwilling to talk  and yet so far from pushing 
shewing so proper and becoming a deference  seeming so pleasantly
grateful for being admitted to hartfield  and so artlessly
impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style
to what she had been used to  that she must have good sense 
and deserve encouragement   encouragement should be given 
those soft blue eyes  and all those natural graces  should not be
wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions 
the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her 
the friends from whom she had just parted  though very good sort
of people  must be doing her harm   they were a family of the name
of martin  whom emma well knew by character  as renting a large farm
of mr  knightley  and residing in the parish of donwell  very creditably 
she believed  she knew mr  knightley thought highly of them  but they
must be coarse and unpolished  and very unfit to be the intimates
of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance
to be quite perfect    she  would notice her  she would improve her 
she would detach her from her bad acquaintance  and introduce her
into good society  she would form her opinions and her manners 
it would be an interesting  and certainly a very kind undertaking 
highly becoming her own situation in life  her leisure  and powers 

she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes  in talking
and listening  and forming all these schemes in the in betweens  that
the evening flew away at a very unusual rate  and the supper table 
which always closed such parties  and for which she had been
used to sit and watch the due time  was all set out and ready 
and moved forwards to the fire  before she was aware   with an
alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never
indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively 
with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas 
did she then do all the honours of the meal  and help and recommend
the minced chicken and scalloped oysters  with an urgency which she
knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests 

upon such occasions poor mr  woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare 
he loved to have the cloth laid  because it had been the fashion
of his youth  but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome
made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it  and while his
hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing 
his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat 

such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that
he could  with thorough self approbation  recommend  though he
might constrain himself  while the ladies were comfortably clearing
the nicer things  to say 

 mrs  bates  let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs 
an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome   serle understands boiling
an egg better than any body   i would not recommend an egg boiled
by any body else  but you need not be afraid  they are very small 
you see  one of our small eggs will not hurt you   miss bates 
let emma help you to a  little  bit of tart  a  very  little bit 
ours are all apple tarts  you need not be afraid of unwholesome
preserves here   i do not advise the custard   mrs  goddard  what say
you to  half  a glass of wine  a  small  half glass  put into a tumbler
of water  i do not think it could disagree with you  

emma allowed her father to talk  but supplied her visitors in
a much more satisfactory style  and on the present evening had
particular pleasure in sending them away happy   the happiness
of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions   miss woodhouse
was so great a personage in highbury  that the prospect of the
introduction had given as much panic as pleasure  but the humble 
grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings 
delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated
her all the evening  and actually shaken hands with her at last 



chapter iv


harriet smith s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing 
quick and decided in her ways  emma lost no time in inviting  encouraging 
and telling her to come very often  and as their acquaintance increased 
so did their satisfaction in each other   as a walking companion 
emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her 
in that respect mrs  weston s loss had been important   her father
never went beyond the shrubbery  where two divisions of the ground
sufficed him for his long walk  or his short  as the year varied 
and since mrs  weston s marriage her exercise had been too much confined 
she had ventured once alone to randalls  but it was not pleasant 
and a harriet smith  therefore  one whom she could summon at any
time to a walk  would be a valuable addition to her privileges 
but in every respect  as she saw more of her  she approved her 
and was confirmed in all her kind designs 

harriet certainly was not clever  but she had a sweet  docile 
grateful disposition  was totally free from conceit  and only desiring
to be guided by any one she looked up to   her early attachment
to herself was very amiable  and her inclination for good company 
and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever  shewed that
there was no want of taste  though strength of understanding must
not be expected   altogether she was quite convinced of harriet
smith s being exactly the young friend she wanted  exactly the
something which her home required   such a friend as mrs  weston
was out of the question   two such could never be granted 
two such she did not want   it was quite a different sort of thing 
a sentiment distinct and independent   mrs  weston was the object
of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem 
harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful 
for mrs  weston there was nothing to be done  for harriet every thing 

her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who
were the parents  but harriet could not tell   she was ready to tell
every thing in her power  but on this subject questions were vain 
emma was obliged to fancy what she liked  but she could never
believe that in the same situation  she  should not have discovered
the truth   harriet had no penetration   she had been satisfied
to hear and believe just what mrs  goddard chose to tell her 
and looked no farther 

mrs  goddard  and the teachers  and the girls and the affairs of the
school in general  formed naturally a great part of the conversation  and
but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey mill farm 
it must have been the whole   but the martins occupied her thoughts
a good deal  she had spent two very happy months with them 
and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit  and describe
the many comforts and wonders of the place   emma encouraged her
talkativeness  amused by such a picture of another set of beings 
and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much
exultation of mrs  martin s having   two  parlours  two very good parlours 
indeed  one of them quite as large as mrs  goddard s drawing room 
and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years
with her  and of their having eight cows  two of them alderneys 
and one a little welch cow  a very pretty little welch cow indeed 
and of mrs  martin s saying as she was so fond of it  it should be
called  her  cow  and of their having a very handsome summer house
in their garden  where some day next year they were all to drink
tea   a very handsome summer house  large enough to hold a dozen people  

for some time she was amused  without thinking beyond the immediate cause 
but as she came to understand the family better  other feelings arose 
she had taken up a wrong idea  fancying it was a mother and daughter 
a son and son s wife  who all lived together  but when it appeared
that the mr  martin  who bore a part in the narrative  and was always
mentioned with approbation for his great good nature in doing something
or other  was a single man  that there was no young mrs  martin 
no wife in the case  she did suspect danger to her poor little
friend from all this hospitality and kindness  and that  if she
were not taken care of  she might be required to sink herself forever 

with this inspiriting notion  her questions increased in number
and meaning  and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr  martin 
and there was evidently no dislike to it   harriet was very ready
to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry
evening games  and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good humoured
and obliging   he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring
her some walnuts  because she had said how fond she was of them 
and in every thing else he was so very obliging   he had his
shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her 
she was very fond of singing   he could sing a little himself 
she believed he was very clever  and understood every thing 
he had a very fine flock  and  while she was with them 
he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country 
she believed every body spoke well of him   his mother and sisters
were very fond of him   mrs  martin had told her one day  and there
was a blush as she said it   that it was impossible for any body
to be a better son  and therefore she was sure  whenever he married 
he would make a good husband   not that she  wanted  him to marry 
she was in no hurry at all 

 well done  mrs  martin   thought emma    you know what you are about  

 and when she had come away  mrs  martin was so very kind as to send
mrs  goddard a beautiful goose  the finest goose mrs  goddard had
ever seen   mrs  goddard had dressed it on a sunday  and asked all
the three teachers  miss nash  and miss prince  and miss richardson 
to sup with her  

 mr  martin  i suppose  is not a man of information beyond the line
of his own business  he does not read  

 oh yes   that is  no  i do not know  but i believe he has
read a good deal  but not what you would think any thing of 
he reads the agricultural reports  and some other books that lay
in one of the window seats  but he reads all  them  to himself 
but sometimes of an evening  before we went to cards  he would read
something aloud out of the elegant extracts  very entertaining 
and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield   he never read the
romance of the forest  nor the children of the abbey   he had never
heard of such books before i mentioned them  but he is determined
to get them now as soon as ever he can  

the next question was  

 what sort of looking man is mr  martin  

 oh  not handsome  not at all handsome   i thought him very plain
at first  but i do not think him so plain now   one does not  you know 
after a time   but did you never see him  he is in highbury every
now and then  and he is sure to ride through every week in his way
to kingston   he has passed you very often  

 that may be  and i may have seen him fifty times  but without
having any idea of his name   a young farmer  whether on horseback
or on foot  is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity 
the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i
can have nothing to do   a degree or two lower  and a creditable
appearance might interest me  i might hope to be useful to their
families in some way or other   but a farmer can need none of my help 
and is  therefore  in one sense  as much above my notice as in every
other he is below it  

 to be sure   oh yes  it is not likely you should ever have
observed him  but he knows you very well indeed  i mean by sight  

 i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man 
i know  indeed  that he is so  and  as such  wish him well 
what do you imagine his age to be  

 he was four and twenty the 8th of last june  and my birthday is
the 23rd just a fortnight and a day s difference  which is very odd  

 only four and twenty  that is too young to settle   his mother is
perfectly right not to be in a hurry   they seem very comfortable
as they are  and if she were to take any pains to marry him 
she would probably repent it   six years hence  if he could meet
with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own 
with a little money  it might be very desirable  

 six years hence  dear miss woodhouse  he would be thirty years old  

 well  and that is as early as most men can afford to marry 
who are not born to an independence   mr  martin  i imagine 
has his fortune entirely to make  cannot be at all beforehand with
the world   whatever money he might come into when his father died 
whatever his share of the family property  it is  i dare say 
all afloat  all employed in his stock  and so forth  and though 
with diligence and good luck  he may be rich in time  it is next to
impossible that he should have realised any thing yet  

 to be sure  so it is   but they live very comfortably 
they have no indoors man  else they do not want for any thing 
and mrs  martin talks of taking a boy another year  

 i wish you may not get into a scrape  harriet  whenever he does
marry   i mean  as to being acquainted with his wife  for though
his sisters  from a superior education  are not to be altogether
objected to  it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit
for you to notice   the misfortune of your birth ought to make you
particularly careful as to your associates   there can be no doubt
of your being a gentleman s daughter  and you must support your
claim to that station by every thing within your own power  or there
will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you  

 yes  to be sure  i suppose there are   but while i visit
at hartfield  and you are so kind to me  miss woodhouse 
i am not afraid of what any body can do  

 you understand the force of influence pretty well  harriet  but i
would have you so firmly established in good society  as to be
independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse   i want to see you
permanently well connected  and to that end it will be advisable
to have as few odd acquaintance as may be  and  therefore  i say
that if you should still be in this country when mr  martin marries 
i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters 
to be acquainted with the wife  who will probably be some mere
farmer s daughter  without education  

 to be sure   yes   not that i think mr  martin would ever marry any body
but what had had some education  and been very well brought up 
however  i do not mean to set up my opinion against your s  and i
am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife   i shall
always have a great regard for the miss martins  especially elizabeth 
and should be very sorry to give them up  for they are quite as well
educated as me   but if he marries a very ignorant  vulgar woman 
certainly i had better not visit her  if i can help it  

emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech 
and saw no alarming symptoms of love   the young man had been
the first admirer  but she trusted there was no other hold 
and that there would be no serious difficulty  on harriet s side 
to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own 

they met mr  martin the very next day  as they were walking on the
donwell road   he was on foot  and after looking very respectfully
at her  looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion 
emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey 
and walking a few yards forward  while they talked together  soon made
her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr  robert martin 
his appearance was very neat  and he looked like a sensible young man 
but his person had no other advantage  and when he came to be
contrasted with gentlemen  she thought he must lose all the ground
he had gained in harriet s inclination   harriet was not insensible
of manner  she had voluntarily noticed her father s gentleness
with admiration as well as wonder   mr  martin looked as if he
did not know what manner was 

they remained but a few minutes together  as miss woodhouse must
not be kept waiting  and harriet then came running to her with a
smiling face  and in a flutter of spirits  which miss woodhouse
hoped very soon to compose 

 only think of our happening to meet him   how very odd  it was
quite a chance  he said  that he had not gone round by randalls 
he did not think we ever walked this road   he thought we walked
towards randalls most days   he has not been able to get the
romance of the forest yet   he was so busy the last time he was
at kingston that he quite forgot it  but he goes again to morrow 
so very odd we should happen to meet  well  miss woodhouse  is he
like what you expected  what do you think of him  do you think him
so very plain  

 he is very plain  undoubtedly  remarkably plain   but that is
nothing compared with his entire want of gentility   i had no
right to expect much  and i did not expect much  but i had no
idea that he could be so very clownish  so totally without air 
i had imagined him  i confess  a degree or two nearer gentility  

 to be sure   said harriet  in a mortified voice   he is not
so genteel as real gentlemen  

 i think  harriet  since your acquaintance with us  you have been
repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen 
that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr  martin 
at hartfield  you have had very good specimens of well educated 
well bred men   i should be surprized if  after seeing them 
you could be in company with mr  martin again without perceiving
him to be a very inferior creature  and rather wondering at
yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before 
do not you begin to feel that now  were not you struck  i am sure
you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner 
and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated
as i stood here  

 certainly  he is not like mr  knightley   he has not such a fine
air and way of walking as mr  knightley   i see the difference
plain enough   but mr  knightley is so very fine a man  

 mr  knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair
to compare mr  martin with  him    you might not see one in a hundred
with  gentleman  so plainly written as in mr  knightley   but he is
not the only gentleman you have been lately used to   what say you
to mr  weston and mr  elton  compare mr  martin with either of  them  
compare their manner of carrying themselves  of walking  of speaking 
of being silent   you must see the difference  

 oh yes   there is a great difference   but mr  weston is almost
an old man   mr  weston must be between forty and fifty  

 which makes his good manners the more valuable   the older a
person grows  harriet  the more important it is that their manners
should not be bad  the more glaring and disgusting any loudness 
or coarseness  or awkwardness becomes   what is passable in youth
is detestable in later age   mr  martin is now awkward and abrupt 
what will he be at mr  weston s time of life  

 there is no saying  indeed   replied harriet rather solemnly 

 but there may be pretty good guessing   he will be a completely gross 
vulgar farmer  totally inattentive to appearances  and thinking
of nothing but profit and loss  

 will he  indeed  that will be very bad  

 how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the
circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended 
he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing
else  which is just as it should be  for a thriving man   what has
he to do with books  and i have no doubt that he  will  thrive 
and be a very rich man in time  and his being illiterate and coarse
need not disturb  us   

 i wonder he did not remember the book   was all harriet s answer 
and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might
be safely left to itself   she  therefore  said no more for some time 
her next beginning was 

 in one respect  perhaps  mr  elton s manners are superior
to mr  knightley s or mr  weston s  they have more gentleness 
they might be more safely held up as a pattern   there is an openness 
a quickness  almost a bluntness in mr  weston  which every body
likes in  him   because there is so much good humour with it  but
that would not do to be copied   neither would mr  knightley s
downright  decided  commanding sort of manner  though it suits
 him  very well  his figure  and look  and situation in life seem
to allow it  but if any young man were to set about copying him 
he would not be sufferable   on the contrary  i think a young man
might be very safely recommended to take mr  elton as a model 
mr  elton is good humoured  cheerful  obliging  and gentle 
he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late   i do not
know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either
of us  harriet  by additional softness  but it strikes me that his
manners are softer than they used to be   if he means any thing 
it must be to please you   did not i tell you what he said of you
the other day  

she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn
from mr  elton  and now did full justice to  and harriet blushed
and smiled  and said she had always thought mr  elton very agreeable 

mr  elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving
the young farmer out of harriet s head   she thought it would
be an excellent match  and only too palpably desirable  natural 
and probable  for her to have much merit in planning it 
she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict 
it was not likely  however  that any body should have equalled
her in the date of the plan  as it had entered her brain during
the very first evening of harriet s coming to hartfield   the longer
she considered it  the greater was her sense of its expediency 
mr  elton s situation was most suitable  quite the gentleman himself 
and without low connexions  at the same time  not of any family
that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet   he had a
comfortable home for her  and emma imagined a very sufficient income 
for though the vicarage of highbury was not large  he was known
to have some independent property  and she thought very highly
of him as a good humoured  well meaning  respectable young man 
without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world 

she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful
girl  which she trusted  with such frequent meetings at hartfield 
was foundation enough on his side  and on harriet s there could be
little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all
the usual weight and efficacy   and he was really a very pleasing
young man  a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like 
he was reckoned very handsome  his person much admired in general 
though not by her  there being a want of elegance of feature which
she could not dispense with   but the girl who could be gratified
by a robert martin s riding about the country to get walnuts
for her might very well be conquered by mr  elton s admiration 



chapter v


 i do not know what your opinion may be  mrs  weston   said mr  knightley   of
this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith  but i think it a bad thing  

 a bad thing  do you really think it a bad thing   why so  

 i think they will neither of them do the other any good  

 you surprize me  emma must do harriet good  and by supplying her
with a new object of interest  harriet may be said to do emma good 
i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure 
how very differently we feel   not think they will do each other any
good  this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels
about emma  mr  knightley  

 perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you 
knowing weston to be out  and that you must still fight your own battle  

 mr  weston would undoubtedly support me  if he were here 
for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject   we were speaking
of it only yesterday  and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma 
that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with 
mr  knightley  i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case 
you are so much used to live alone  that you do not know the value
of a companion  and  perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort
a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex  after being used
to it all her life   i can imagine your objection to harriet smith 
she is not the superior young woman which emma s friend ought to be 
but on the other hand  as emma wants to see her better informed 
it will be an inducement to her to read more herself   they will
read together   she means it  i know  

 emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve
years old   i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at
various times of books that she meant to read regularly through  and
very good lists they were  very well chosen  and very neatly
arranged  sometimes alphabetically  and sometimes by some other rule 
the list she drew up when only fourteen  i remember thinking it
did her judgment so much credit  that i preserved it some time 
and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now   but i
have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma 
she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience 
and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding   where miss taylor
failed to stimulate  i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do
nothing   you never could persuade her to read half so much as you
wished   you know you could not  

 i dare say   replied mrs  weston  smiling   that i thought
so  then    but since we have parted  i can never remember emma s
omitting to do any thing i wished  

 there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as  that     said
mr  knightley  feelingly  and for a moment or two he had done    but i  
he soon added   who have had no such charm thrown over my senses 
must still see  hear  and remember   emma is spoiled by being the
cleverest of her family   at ten years old  she had the misfortune of
being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen 
she was always quick and assured  isabella slow and diffident 
and ever since she was twelve  emma has been mistress of the house
and of you all   in her mother she lost the only person able to cope
with her   she inherits her mother s talents  and must have been
under subjection to her  

 i should have been sorry  mr  knightley  to be dependent on
 your  recommendation  had i quitted mr  woodhouse s family and wanted
another situation  i do not think you would have spoken a good word for
me to any body   i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held  

 yes   said he  smiling    you are better placed  here   very fit
for a wife  but not at all for a governess   but you were preparing
yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield 
you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would
seem to promise  but you were receiving a very good education from  her  
on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will 
and doing as you were bid  and if weston had asked me to recommend
him a wife  i should certainly have named miss taylor  

 thank you   there will be very little merit in making a good wife
to such a man as mr  weston  

 why  to own the truth  i am afraid you are rather thrown away 
and that with every disposition to bear  there will be nothing
to be borne   we will not despair  however   weston may grow cross
from the wantonness of comfort  or his son may plague him  

 i hope not  that    it is not likely   no  mr  knightley  do not
foretell vexation from that quarter  

 not i  indeed   i only name possibilities   i do not pretend to emma s
genius for foretelling and guessing   i hope  with all my heart 
the young man may be a weston in merit  and a churchill in fortune   but
harriet smith  i have not half done about harriet smith   i think
her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have 
she knows nothing herself  and looks upon emma as knowing every thing 
she is a flatterer in all her ways  and so much the worse 
because undesigned   her ignorance is hourly flattery   how can
emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself  while harriet
is presenting such a delightful inferiority  and as for harriet 
i will venture to say that  she  cannot gain by the acquaintance 
hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places
she belongs to   she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable
with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home 
i am much mistaken if emma s doctrines give any strength of mind 
or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties
of her situation in life   they only give a little polish  

 i either depend more upon emma s good sense than you do  or am more
anxious for her present comfort  for i cannot lament the acquaintance 
how well she looked last night  

 oh  you would rather talk of her person than her mind  would you 
very well  i shall not attempt to deny emma s being pretty  

 pretty  say beautiful rather   can you imagine any thing nearer
perfect beauty than emma altogether  face and figure  

 i do not know what i could imagine  but i confess that i have
seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers 
but i am a partial old friend  

 such an eye   the true hazle eye  and so brilliant  regular features 
open countenance  with a complexion  oh  what a bloom of full health 
and such a pretty height and size  such a firm and upright figure 
there is health  not merely in her bloom  but in her air  her head 
her glance   one hears sometimes of a child being  the picture
of health   now  emma always gives me the idea of being the complete
picture of grown up health   she is loveliness itself   mr  knightley 
is not she  

 i have not a fault to find with her person   he replied 
 i think her all you describe   i love to look at her  and i
will add this praise  that i do not think her personally vain 
considering how very handsome she is  she appears to be little
occupied with it  her vanity lies another way   mrs  weston  i am
not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith  or my dread
of its doing them both harm  

 and i  mr  knightley  am equally stout in my confidence of its
not doing them any harm   with all dear emma s little faults 
she is an excellent creature   where shall we see a better daughter 
or a kinder sister  or a truer friend  no  no  she has qualities
which may be trusted  she will never lead any one really wrong 
she will make no lasting blunder  where emma errs once  she is in the
right a hundred times  

 very well  i will not plague you any more   emma shall be an angel 
and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john
and isabella   john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore
not a blind affection  and isabella always thinks as he does 
except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children 
i am sure of having their opinions with me  

 i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind 
but excuse me  mr  knightley  if i take the liberty  i consider myself 
you know  as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s
mother might have had  the liberty of hinting that i do not think
any possible good can arise from harriet smith s intimacy being made
a matter of much discussion among you   pray excuse me  but supposing
any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy 
it cannot be expected that emma  accountable to nobody but her father 
who perfectly approves the acquaintance  should put an end to it 
so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself   it has been so
many years my province to give advice  that you cannot be surprized 
mr  knightley  at this little remains of office  

 not at all   cried he   i am much obliged to you for it 
it is very good advice  and it shall have a better fate than your
advice has often found  for it shall be attended to  

 mrs  john knightley is easily alarmed  and might be made unhappy
about her sister  

 be satisfied   said he   i will not raise any outcry   i will keep
my ill humour to myself   i have a very sincere interest in emma 
isabella does not seem more my sister  has never excited a
greater interest  perhaps hardly so great   there is an anxiety 
a curiosity in what one feels for emma   i wonder what will become
of her  

 so do i   said mrs  weston gently   very much  

 she always declares she will never marry  which  of course 
means just nothing at all   but i have no idea that she has yet
ever seen a man she cared for   it would not be a bad thing for her
to be very much in love with a proper object   i should like to see
emma in love  and in some doubt of a return  it would do her good 
but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her  and she goes so seldom
from home  

 there does  indeed  seem as little to tempt her to break
her resolution at present   said mrs  weston   as can well be 
and while she is so happy at hartfield  i cannot wish her to be
forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties
on poor mr  woodhouse s account   i do not recommend matrimony
at present to emma  though i mean no slight to the state  i assure you  

part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of
her own and mr  weston s on the subject  as much as possible 
there were wishes at randalls respecting emma s destiny  but it
was not desirable to have them suspected  and the quiet transition
which mr  knightley soon afterwards made to  what does weston
think of the weather  shall we have rain   convinced her that he
had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield 



chapter vi


emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet s fancy
a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity
to a very good purpose  for she found her decidedly more sensible
than before of mr  elton s being a remarkably handsome man  with most
agreeable manners  and as she had no hesitation in following up
the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints  she was soon
pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet s side 
as there could be any occasion for   she was quite convinced
of mr  elton s being in the fairest way of falling in love 
if not in love already   she had no scruple with regard to him 
he talked of harriet  and praised her so warmly  that she could
not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add 
his perception of the striking improvement of harriet s manner 
since her introduction at hartfield  was not one of the least
agreeable proofs of his growing attachment 

 you have given miss smith all that she required   said he 
 you have made her graceful and easy   she was a beautiful creature
when she came to you  but  in my opinion  the attractions you have
added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature  

 i am glad you think i have been useful to her  but harriet
only wanted drawing out  and receiving a few  very few hints 
she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness
in herself   i have done very little  

 if it were admissible to contradict a lady   said the gallant
mr  elton  

 i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character 
have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her
way before  

 exactly so  that is what principally strikes me   so much superadded
decision of character  skilful has been the hand  

 great has been the pleasure  i am sure   i never met with
a disposition more truly amiable  

 i have no doubt of it   and it was spoken with a sort
of sighing animation  which had a vast deal of the lover 
she was not less pleased another day with the manner
in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers  to have harriet s picture 

 did you ever have your likeness taken  harriet   said she   did
you ever sit for your picture  

harriet was on the point of leaving the room  and only stopt to say 
with a very interesting naivete 

 oh  dear  no  never  

no sooner was she out of sight  than emma exclaimed 

 what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be  i would
give any money for it   i almost long to attempt her likeness myself 
you do not know it i dare say  but two or three years ago i had
a great passion for taking likenesses  and attempted several of
my friends  and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general 
but from one cause or another  i gave it up in disgust 
but really  i could almost venture  if harriet would sit to me 
it would be such a delight to have her picture  

 let me entreat you   cried mr  elton   it would indeed be a delight 
let me entreat you  miss woodhouse  to exercise so charming a
talent in favour of your friend   i know what your drawings are 
how could you suppose me ignorant  is not this room rich in
specimens of your landscapes and flowers  and has not mrs  weston
some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room  at randalls  

yes  good man   thought emma  but what has all that to do with taking
likenesses  you know nothing of drawing   don t pretend to be
in raptures about mine   keep your raptures for harriet s face 
 well  if you give me such kind encouragement  mr  elton  i believe
i shall try what i can do   harriet s features are very delicate 
which makes a likeness difficult  and yet there is a peculiarity
in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought
to catch  

 exactly so  the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth  i
have not a doubt of your success   pray  pray attempt it 
as you will do it  it will indeed  to use your own words 
be an exquisite possession  

 but i am afraid  mr  elton  harriet will not like to sit 
she thinks so little of her own beauty   did not you observe her
manner of answering me  how completely it meant   why should my
picture be drawn   

 oh  yes  i observed it  i assure you   it was not lost on me 
but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded  

harriet was soon back again  and the proposal almost immediately made 
and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest
pressing of both the others   emma wished to go to work directly 
and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts
at portraits  for not one of them had ever been finished  that they
might decide together on the best size for harriet   her many
beginnings were displayed   miniatures  half lengths  whole lengths 
pencil  crayon  and water colours had been all tried in turn 
she had always wanted to do every thing  and had made more progress
both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little
labour as she would ever submit to   she played and sang   and drew
in almost every style  but steadiness had always been wanting 
and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she
would have been glad to command  and ought not to have failed of 
she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist
or a musician  but she was not unwilling to have others deceived 
or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher
than it deserved 

there was merit in every drawing  in the least finished  perhaps the most 
her style was spirited  but had there been much less  or had there
been ten times more  the delight and admiration of her two companions
would have been the same   they were both in ecstasies   a likeness
pleases every body  and miss woodhouse s performances must be capital 

 no great variety of faces for you   said emma    i had only my
own family to study from   there is my father  another of my
father  but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous 
that i could only take him by stealth  neither of them very
like therefore   mrs  weston again  and again  and again  you see 
dear mrs  weston  always my kindest friend on every occasion 
she would sit whenever i asked her   there is my sister  and really
quite her own little elegant figure   and the face not unlike 
i should have made a good likeness of her  if she would have
sat longer  but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four
children that she would not be quiet   then  here come all my
attempts at three of those four children   there they are 
henry and john and bella  from one end of the sheet to the other 
and any one of them might do for any one of the rest   she was so
eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse  but there is no
making children of three or four years old stand still you know 
nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them  beyond the
air and complexion  unless they are coarser featured than any
of mama s children ever were   here is my sketch of the fourth 
who was a baby   i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa  and it
is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see 
he had nestled down his head most conveniently   that s very like 
i am rather proud of little george   the corner of the sofa is very good 
then here is my last    unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman
in small size  whole length   my last and my best  my brother 
mr  john knightley   this did not want much of being finished  when i
put it away in a pet  and vowed i would never take another likeness 
i could not help being provoked  for after all my pains  and when i
had really made a very good likeness of it   mrs  weston and i
were quite agreed in thinking it  very  like   only too handsome  too
flattering  but that was a fault on the right side  after
all this  came poor dear isabella s cold approbation of   yes 
it was a little like  but to be sure it did not do him justice  
we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all 
it was made a great favour of  and altogether it was more than i
could bear  and so i never would finish it  to have it apologised
over as an unfavourable likeness  to every morning visitor in
brunswick square   and  as i said  i did then forswear ever drawing
any body again   but for harriet s sake  or rather for my own 
and as there are no husbands and wives in the case  at   present  
i will break my resolution now  

mr  elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea 
and was repeating   no husbands and wives in the case at present
indeed  as you observe   exactly so   no husbands and wives  
with so interesting a consciousness  that emma began to consider
whether she had not better leave them together at once   but as she
wanted to be drawing  the declaration must wait a little longer 

she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait 
it was to be a whole length in water colours  like mr  john
knightley s  and was destined  if she could please herself 
to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece 

the sitting began  and harriet  smiling and blushing  and afraid
of not keeping her attitude and countenance  presented a very sweet
mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist 
but there was no doing any thing  with mr  elton fidgeting behind
her and watching every touch   she gave him credit for stationing
himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence 
but was really obliged to put an end to it  and request him to
place himself elsewhere   it then occurred to her to employ him
in reading 

 if he would be so good as to read to them  it would be a kindness
indeed  it would amuse away the difficulties of her part  and lessen
the irksomeness of miss smith s  

mr  elton was only too happy   harriet listened  and emma drew
in peace   she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look 
any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover 
and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil 
to jump up and see the progress  and be charmed   there was no
being displeased with such an encourager  for his admiration
made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible 
she could not respect his eye  but his love and his complaisance
were unexceptionable 

the sitting was altogether very satisfactory  she was quite
enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on 
there was no want of likeness  she had been fortunate in the attitude 
and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure 
to give a little more height  and considerably more elegance  she had
great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last 
and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both  a
standing memorial of the beauty of one  the skill of the other 
and the friendship of both  with as many other agreeable associations
as mr  elton s very promising attachment was likely to add 

harriet was to sit again the next day  and mr  elton  just as he ought 
entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again 

 by all means   we shall be most happy to consider you as one
of the party  

the same civilities and courtesies  the same success and satisfaction 
took place on the morrow  and accompanied the whole progress
of the picture  which was rapid and happy   every body who saw it
was pleased  but mr  elton was in continual raptures  and defended
it through every criticism 

 miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she
wanted    observed mrs  weston to him  not in the least suspecting
that she was addressing a lover    the expression of the eye is
most correct  but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes 
it is the fault of her face that she has them not  

 do you think so   replied he    i cannot agree with you 
it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature 
i never saw such a likeness in my life   we must allow for the effect
of shade  you know  

 you have made her too tall  emma   said mr  knightley 

emma knew that she had  but would not own it  and mr  elton warmly added 

 oh no  certainly not too tall  not in the least too tall   consider 
she is sitting down  which naturally presents a different  which
in short gives exactly the idea  and the proportions must
be preserved  you know   proportions  fore shortening   oh no  it
gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s  exactly so indeed  

 it is very pretty   said mr  woodhouse    so prettily done  just
as your drawings always are  my dear   i do not know any body who draws
so well as you do   the only thing i do not thoroughly like is 
that she seems to be sitting out of doors  with only a little shawl
over her shoulders  and it makes one think she must catch cold  

 but  my dear papa  it is supposed to be summer  a warm day in summer 
look at the tree  

 but it is never safe to sit out of doors  my dear  

 you  sir  may say any thing   cried mr  elton   but i must confess
that i regard it as a most happy thought  the placing of miss
smith out of doors  and the tree is touched with such inimitable
spirit  any other situation would have been much less in character 
the naivete of miss smith s manners  and altogether  oh  it is
most admirable  i cannot keep my eyes from it   i never saw such
a likeness  

the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed  and here were a
few difficulties   it must be done directly  it must be done in london 
the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste
could be depended on  and isabella  the usual doer of all commissions 
must not be applied to  because it was december  and mr  woodhouse
could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs
of december   but no sooner was the distress known to mr  elton 
than it was removed   his gallantry was always on the alert 
 might he be trusted with the commission  what infinite pleasure
should he have in executing it  he could ride to london at any time 
it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being
employed on such an errand  

 he was too good   she could not endure the thought   she would
not give him such a troublesome office for the world    brought
on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances   and
a very few minutes settled the business 

mr  elton was to take the drawing to london  chuse the frame 
and give the directions  and emma thought she could so pack it
as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him  while he
seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough 

 what a precious deposit   said he with a tender sigh  as he
received it 

 this man is almost too gallant to be in love   thought emma 
 i should say so  but that i suppose there may be a hundred different
ways of being in love   he is an excellent young man  and will suit
harriet exactly  it will be an  exactly so   as he says himself 
but he does sigh and languish  and study for compliments rather more
than i could endure as a principal   i come in for a pretty good
share as a second   but it is his gratitude on harriet s account  



chapter vii


the very day of mr  elton s going to london produced a fresh occasion
for emma s services towards her friend   harriet had been at hartfield 
as usual  soon after breakfast  and  after a time  had gone home
to return again to dinner  she returned  and sooner than had been
talked of  and with an agitated  hurried look  announcing something
extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell 
half a minute brought it all out   she had heard  as soon as she got
back to mrs  goddard s  that mr  martin had been there an hour before 
and finding she was not at home  nor particularly expected  had left
a little parcel for her from one of his sisters  and gone away 
and on opening this parcel  she had actually found  besides the two
songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy  a letter to herself 
and this letter was from him  from mr  martin  and contained a direct
proposal of marriage    who could have thought it  she was so surprized
she did not know what to do   yes  quite a proposal of marriage 
and a very good letter  at least she thought so   and he wrote
as if he really loved her very much  but she did not know  and so 
she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she
should do     emma was half ashamed of her friend for seeming so
pleased and so doubtful 

 upon my word   she cried   the young man is determined not to lose
any thing for want of asking   he will connect himself well if he can  

 will you read the letter   cried harriet    pray do   i d rather
you would  

emma was not sorry to be pressed   she read  and was surprized 
the style of the letter was much above her expectation 
there were not merely no grammatical errors  but as a composition it
would not have disgraced a gentleman  the language  though plain 
was strong and unaffected  and the sentiments it conveyed very much
to the credit of the writer   it was short  but expressed good sense 
warm attachment  liberality  propriety  even delicacy of feeling 
she paused over it  while harriet stood anxiously watching for
her opinion  with a  well  well   and was at last forced to add 
 is it a good letter  or is it too short  

 yes  indeed  a very good letter   replied emma rather slowly   so
good a letter  harriet  that every thing considered  i think one of
his sisters must have helped him   i can hardly imagine the young
man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself
so well  if left quite to his own powers  and yet it is not the
style of a woman  no  certainly  it is too strong and concise 
not diffuse enough for a woman   no doubt he is a sensible man 
and i suppose may have a natural talent for  thinks strongly and
clearly  and when he takes a pen in hand  his thoughts naturally find
proper words   it is so with some men   yes  i understand the sort
of mind   vigorous  decided  with sentiments to a certain point 
not coarse   a better written letter  harriet  returning it  
than i had expected  

 well   said the still waiting harriet    well  and  and what
shall i do  

 what shall you do  in what respect  do you mean with regard
to this letter  

 yes  

 but what are you in doubt of  you must answer it of course  and speedily  

 yes  but what shall i say  dear miss woodhouse  do advise me  

 oh no  no  the letter had much better be all your own   you will
express yourself very properly  i am sure   there is no danger of your
not being intelligible  which is the first thing   your meaning must
be unequivocal  no doubts or demurs  and such expressions of gratitude
and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires 
will present themselves unbidden to  your  mind  i am persuaded 
you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow
for his disappointment  

 you think i ought to refuse him then   said harriet  looking down 

 ought to refuse him  my dear harriet  what do you mean  are you
in any doubt as to that  i thought  but i beg your pardon  perhaps i
have been under a mistake   i certainly have been misunderstanding
you  if you feel in doubt as to the  purport  of your answer 
i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it  

harriet was silent   with a little reserve of manner  emma continued 

 you mean to return a favourable answer  i collect  

 no  i do not  that is  i do not mean  what shall i do  what would
you advise me to do  pray  dear miss woodhouse  tell me what i
ought to do  

 i shall not give you any advice  harriet   i will have nothing to
do with it   this is a point which you must settle with your feelings  

 i had no notion that he liked me so very much   said harriet 
contemplating the letter   for a little while emma persevered
in her silence  but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery
of that letter might be too powerful  she thought it best to say 

 i lay it down as a general rule  harriet  that if a woman  doubts 
as to whether she should accept a man or not  she certainly ought
to refuse him   if she can hesitate as to  yes   she ought to say
 no  directly   it is not a state to be safely entered into
with doubtful feelings  with half a heart   i thought it my duty
as a friend  and older than yourself  to say thus much to you 
but do not imagine that i want to influence you  

 oh  no  i am sure you are a great deal too kind to  but if you
would just advise me what i had best do  no  no  i do not mean
that  as you say  one s mind ought to be quite made up  one should
not be hesitating  it is a very serious thing   it will be safer
to say  no   perhaps   do you think i had better say  no   

 not for the world   said emma  smiling graciously   would i advise
you either way   you must be the best judge of your own happiness 
if you prefer mr  martin to every other person  if you think him
the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with  why should
you hesitate  you blush  harriet   does any body else occur to you
at this moment under such a definition  harriet  harriet  do not
deceive yourself  do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion 
at this moment whom are you thinking of  

the symptoms were favourable   instead of answering  harriet turned
away confused  and stood thoughtfully by the fire  and though
the letter was still in her hand  it was now mechanically twisted
about without regard   emma waited the result with impatience 
but not without strong hopes   at last  with some hesitation 
harriet said  

 miss woodhouse  as you will not give me your opinion  i must
do as well as i can by myself  and i have now quite determined 
and really almost made up my mind  to refuse mr  martin   do you
think i am right  

 perfectly  perfectly right  my dearest harriet  you are doing just
what you ought   while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings
to myself  but now that you are so completely decided i have no
hesitation in approving   dear harriet  i give myself joy of this 
it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance  which must have
been the consequence of your marrying mr  martin   while you were in
the smallest degree wavering  i said nothing about it  because i would
not influence  but it would have been the loss of a friend to me 
i could not have visited mrs  robert martin  of abbey mill farm 
now i am secure of you for ever  

harriet had not surmised her own danger  but the idea of it struck
her forcibly 

 you could not have visited me   she cried  looking aghast 
 no  to be sure you could not  but i never thought of that before 
that would have been too dreadful   what an escape   dear miss woodhouse 
i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you
for any thing in the world  

 indeed  harriet  it would have been a severe pang to lose you 
but it must have been   you would have thrown yourself out of all
good society   i must have given you up  

 dear me   how should i ever have borne it  it would have killed
me never to come to hartfield any more  

 dear affectionate creature    you  banished to abbey mill farm    you 
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life 
i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it 
he must have a pretty good opinion of himself  

 i do not think he is conceited either  in general   said harriet 
her conscience opposing such censure   at least  he is very good natured 
and i shall always feel much obliged to him  and have a great regard
for  but that is quite a different thing from  and you know 
though he may like me  it does not follow that i should  and
certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen
people  and if one comes to compare them  person and manners 
there is no comparison at all   one  is so very handsome and agreeable 
however  i do really think mr  martin a very amiable young man 
and have a great opinion of him  and his being so much attached
to me  and his writing such a letter  but as to leaving you 
it is what i would not do upon any consideration  

 thank you  thank you  my own sweet little friend   we will not
be parted   a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked 
or because he is attached to her  and can write a tolerable letter  

 oh no   and it is but a short letter too  

emma felt the bad taste of her friend  but let it pass with a
 very true  and it would be a small consolation to her  for the
clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day 
to know that her husband could write a good letter  

 oh  yes  very   nobody cares for a letter  the thing is  to be always
happy with pleasant companions   i am quite determined to refuse him 
but how shall i do  what shall i say  

emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer 
and advised its being written directly  which was agreed to 
in the hope of her assistance  and though emma continued to protest
against any assistance being wanted  it was in fact given in the
formation of every sentence   the looking over his letter again 
in replying to it  had such a softening tendency  that it was
particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions 
and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy 
and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say 
and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful 
that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment 
he would have been accepted after all 

this letter  however  was written  and sealed  and sent 
the business was finished  and harriet safe   she was rather low
all the evening  but emma could allow for her amiable regrets 
and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection 
sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr  elton 

 i shall never be invited to abbey mill again   was said in rather
a sorrowful tone 

 nor  if you were  could i ever bear to part with you  my harriet 
you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared
to abbey mill  

 and i am sure i should never want to go there  for i am never happy
but at hartfield  

some time afterwards it was   i think mrs  goddard would be very
much surprized if she knew what had happened   i am sure miss nash
would  for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married 
and it is only a linen draper  

 one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the
teacher of a school  harriet   i dare say miss nash would envy you
such an opportunity as this of being married   even this conquest
would appear valuable in her eyes   as to any thing superior for you 
i suppose she is quite in the dark   the attentions of a certain
person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet 
hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks
and manners have explained themselves  

harriet blushed and smiled  and said something about wondering
that people should like her so much   the idea of mr  elton was
certainly cheering  but still  after a time  she was tender hearted
again towards the rejected mr  martin 

 now he has got my letter   said she softly    i wonder what they
are all doing  whether his sisters know  if he is unhappy 
they will be unhappy too   i hope he will not mind it so very much  

 let us think of those among our absent friends who are more
cheerfully employed   cried emma    at this moment  perhaps  mr  elton
is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters  telling how much
more beautiful is the original  and after being asked for it five
or six times  allowing them to hear your name  your own dear name  

 my picture   but he has left my picture in bond street  

 has he so   then i know nothing of mr  elton   no  my dear
little modest harriet  depend upon it the picture will not be
in bond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow 
it is his companion all this evening  his solace  his delight 
it opens his designs to his family  it introduces you among them 
it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature 
eager curiosity and warm prepossession   how cheerful  how animated 
how suspicious  how busy their imaginations all are  

harriet smiled again  and her smiles grew stronger 



chapter viii


harriet slept at hartfield that night   for some weeks past she
had been spending more than half her time there  and gradually
getting to have a bed room appropriated to herself  and emma
judged it best in every respect  safest and kindest  to keep her
with them as much as possible just at present   she was obliged
to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs  goddard s 
but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield 
to make a regular visit of some days 

while she was gone  mr  knightley called  and sat some time with
mr  woodhouse and emma  till mr  woodhouse  who had previously made up
his mind to walk out  was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it 
and was induced by the entreaties of both  though against the scruples
of his own civility  to leave mr  knightley for that purpose 
mr  knightley  who had nothing of ceremony about him  was offering
by his short  decided answers  an amusing contrast to the protracted
apologies and civil hesitations of the other 

 well  i believe  if you will excuse me  mr  knightley  if you
will not consider me as doing a very rude thing  i shall take
emma s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour   as the sun
is out  i believe i had better take my three turns while i can 
i treat you without ceremony  mr  knightley   we invalids think we
are privileged people  

 my dear sir  do not make a stranger of me  

 i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter   emma will be happy
to entertain you   and therefore i think i will beg your excuse
and take my three turns  my winter walk  

 you cannot do better  sir  

 i would ask for the pleasure of your company  mr  knightley 
but i am a very slow walker  and my pace would be tedious to you 
and  besides  you have another long walk before you  to donwell abbey  

 thank you  sir  thank you  i am going this moment myself  and i
think the sooner  you  go the better   i will fetch your greatcoat
and open the garden door for you  

mr  woodhouse at last was off  but mr  knightley  instead of being
immediately off likewise  sat down again  seemingly inclined
for more chat   he began speaking of harriet  and speaking
of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before 

 i cannot rate her beauty as you do   said he   but she is a
pretty little creature  and i am inclined to think very well of
her disposition   her character depends upon those she is with 
but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman  

 i am glad you think so  and the good hands  i hope  may not be wanting  

 come   said he   you are anxious for a compliment  so i will
tell you that you have improved her   you have cured her of her
school girl s giggle  she really does you credit  

 thank you   i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i
had been of some use  but it is not every body who will bestow
praise where they may    you  do not often overpower me with it  

 you are expecting her again  you say  this morning  

 almost every moment   she has been gone longer already than
she intended  

 something has happened to delay her  some visitors perhaps  

 highbury gossips   tiresome wretches  

 harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would  

emma knew this was too true for contradiction  and therefore
said nothing   he presently added  with a smile 

 i do not pretend to fix on times or places  but i must tell you
that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon
hear of something to her advantage  

 indeed  how so  of what sort  

 a very serious sort  i assure you   still smiling 

 very serious  i can think of but one thing  who is in love
with her  who makes you their confidant  

emma was more than half in hopes of mr  elton s having dropt a hint 
mr  knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser  and she knew
mr  elton looked up to him 

 i have reason to think   he replied   that harriet smith will
soon have an offer of marriage  and from a most unexceptionable
quarter   robert martin is the man   her visit to abbey mill 
this summer  seems to have done his business   he is desperately
in love and means to marry her  

 he is very obliging   said emma   but is he sure that harriet
means to marry him  

 well  well  means to make her an offer then   will that do  he came
to the abbey two evenings ago  on purpose to consult me about it 
he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family  and 
i believe  considers me as one of his best friends   he came to ask
me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early 
whether i thought her too young  in short  whether i approved his
choice altogether  having some apprehension perhaps of her being
considered  especially since  your  making so much of her  as in a line
of society above him   i was very much pleased with all that he said 
i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin 
he always speaks to the purpose  open  straightforward  and very
well judging   he told me every thing  his circumstances and plans 
and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage   he is
an excellent young man  both as son and brother   i had no hesitation
in advising him to marry   he proved to me that he could afford it 
and that being the case  i was convinced he could not do better 
i praised the fair lady too  and altogether sent him away very happy 
if he had never esteemed my opinion before  he would have thought
highly of me then  and  i dare say  left the house thinking me the
best friend and counsellor man ever had   this happened the night
before last   now  as we may fairly suppose  he would not allow
much time to pass before he spoke to the lady  and as he does not
appear to have spoken yesterday  it is not unlikely that he should
be at mrs  goddard s to day  and she may be detained by a visitor 
without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch  

 pray  mr  knightley   said emma  who had been smiling to herself
through a great part of this speech   how do you know that mr  martin
did not speak yesterday  

 certainly   replied he  surprized   i do not absolutely know it 
but it may be inferred   was not she the whole day with you  

 come   said she   i will tell you something  in return for what
you have told me   he did speak yesterday  that is  he wrote 
and was refused  

this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed 
and mr  knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure 
as he stood up  in tall indignation  and said 

 then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her 
what is the foolish girl about  

 oh  to be sure   cried emma   it is always incomprehensible
to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage 
a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her  

 nonsense  a man does not imagine any such thing   but what is
the meaning of this  harriet smith refuse robert martin  madness 
if it is so  but i hope you are mistaken  

 i saw her answer   nothing could be clearer  

 you saw her answer   you wrote her answer too   emma  this is
your doing   you persuaded her to refuse him  

 and if i did   which  however  i am far from allowing  i should
not feel that i had done wrong   mr  martin is a very respectable
young man  but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal  and am
rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her 
by your account  he does seem to have had some scruples   it is
a pity that they were ever got over  

 not harriet s equal   exclaimed mr  knightley loudly and warmly 
and with calmer asperity  added  a few moments afterwards   no  he
is not her equal indeed  for he is as much her superior in sense
as in situation   emma  your infatuation about that girl blinds you 
what are harriet smith s claims  either of birth  nature or education 
to any connexion higher than robert martin  she is the natural
daughter of nobody knows whom  with probably no settled provision
at all  and certainly no respectable relations   she is known only
as parlour boarder at a common school   she is not a sensible girl 
nor a girl of any information   she has been taught nothing useful 
and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself 
at her age she can have no experience  and with her little wit 
is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her 
she is pretty  and she is good tempered  and that is all 
my only scruple in advising the match was on his account  as being
beneath his deserts  and a bad connexion for him   i felt that 
as to fortune  in all probability he might do much better  and that as
to a rational companion or useful helpmate  he could not do worse 
but i could not reason so to a man in love  and was willing
to trust to there being no harm in her  to her having that sort
of disposition  which  in good hands  like his  might be easily led
aright and turn out very well   the advantage of the match i felt
to be all on her side  and had not the smallest doubt  nor have i now 
that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck 
even  your  satisfaction i made sure of   it crossed my mind immediately
that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury  for the
sake of her being settled so well   i remember saying to myself 
 even emma  with all her partiality for harriet  will think this a
good match   

 i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say
any such thing   what  think a farmer   and with all his sense and all
his merit mr  martin is nothing more   a good match for my intimate
friend  not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying
a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own  i
wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings 
i assure you mine are very different   i must think your statement
by no means fair   you are not just to harriet s claims 
they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself 
mr  martin may be the richest of the two  but he is undoubtedly
her inferior as to rank in society   the sphere in which she moves
is much above his   it would be a degradation  

 a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance  to be married
to a respectable  intelligent gentleman farmer  

 as to the circumstances of her birth  though in a legal sense
she may be called nobody  it will not hold in common sense 
she is not to pay for the offence of others  by being held below
the level of those with whom she is brought up   there can scarcely
be a doubt that her father is a gentleman  and a gentleman of
fortune   her allowance is very liberal  nothing has ever been grudged
for her improvement or comfort   that she is a gentleman s daughter 
is indubitable to me  that she associates with gentlemen s daughters 
no one  i apprehend  will deny   she is superior to mr  robert martin  

 whoever might be her parents   said mr  knightley   whoever may
have had the charge of her  it does not appear to have been any part
of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society 
after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in
mrs  goddard s hands to shift as she can   to move  in short 
in mrs  goddard s line  to have mrs  goddard s acquaintance 
her friends evidently thought this good enough for her  and it  was 
good enough   she desired nothing better herself   till you chose
to turn her into a friend  her mind had no distaste for her own set 
nor any ambition beyond it   she was as happy as possible with the
martins in the summer   she had no sense of superiority then 
if she has it now  you have given it   you have been no friend to
harriet smith  emma   robert martin would never have proceeded so far 
if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him 
i know him well   he has too much real feeling to address any
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion   and as to conceit 
he is the farthest from it of any man i know   depend upon it he
had encouragement  

it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this
assertion  she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again 

 you are a very warm friend to mr  martin  but  as i said before 
are unjust to harriet   harriet s claims to marry well are not
so contemptible as you represent them   she is not a clever girl 
but she has better sense than you are aware of  and does not
deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly 
waiving that point  however  and supposing her to be  as you
describe her  only pretty and good natured  let me tell you  that in
the degree she possesses them  they are not trivial recommendations
to the world in general  for she is  in fact  a beautiful girl 
and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred 
and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject
of beauty than they are generally supposed  till they do fall
in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces  a girl 
with such loveliness as harriet  has a certainty of being admired
and sought after  of having the power of chusing from among many 
consequently a claim to be nice   her good nature  too  is not so very
slight a claim  comprehending  as it does  real  thorough sweetness
of temper and manner  a very humble opinion of herself  and a great
readiness to be pleased with other people   i am very much mistaken
if your sex in general would not think such beauty  and such temper 
the highest claims a woman could possess  

 upon my word  emma  to hear you abusing the reason you have 
is almost enough to make me think so too   better be without sense 
than misapply it as you do  

 to be sure   cried she playfully    i know  that  is the feeling
of you all   i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly
what every man delights in  what at once bewitches his senses
and satisfies his judgment   oh  harriet may pick and chuse 
were you  yourself  ever to marry  she is the very woman for you 
and is she  at seventeen  just entering into life  just beginning
to be known  to be wondered at because she does not accept the first
offer she receives  no  pray let her have time to look about her  

 i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy   said mr  knightley
presently   though i have kept my thoughts to myself  but i now
perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet 
you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty  and of what
she has a claim to  that  in a little while  nobody within her
reach will be good enough for her   vanity working on a weak head 
produces every sort of mischief   nothing so easy as for a young lady
to raise her expectations too high   miss harriet smith may not find
offers of marriage flow in so fast  though she is a very pretty girl 
men of sense  whatever you may chuse to say  do not want silly wives 
men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves
with a girl of such obscurity  and most prudent men would be
afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in 
when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed   let her marry
robert martin  and she is safe  respectable  and happy for ever 
but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly  and teach
her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence
and large fortune  she may be a parlour boarder at mrs  goddard s
all the rest of her life  or  at least   for harriet smith is a
girl who will marry somebody or other   till she grow desperate 
and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son  

 we think so very differently on this point  mr  knightley 
that there can be no use in canvassing it   we shall only be making
each other more angry   but as to my  letting  her marry robert martin 
it is impossible  she has refused him  and so decidedly  i think 
as must prevent any second application   she must abide by the evil
of having refused him  whatever it may be  and as to the refusal itself 
i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little 
but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do 
his appearance is so much against him  and his manner so bad 
that if she ever were disposed to favour him  she is not now 
i can imagine  that before she had seen any body superior 
she might tolerate him   he was the brother of her friends 
and he took pains to please her  and altogether  having seen
nobody better  that must have been his great assistant 
she might not  while she was at abbey mill  find him disagreeable 
but the case is altered now   she knows now what gentlemen are 
and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance
with harriet  

 nonsense  errant nonsense  as ever was talked   cried mr  knightley    robert
martin s manners have sense  sincerity  and good humour to recommend
them  and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand  

emma made no answer  and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned  but was
really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone 
she did not repent what she had done  she still thought herself
a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he
could be  but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment
in general  which made her dislike having it so loudly against her 
and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state 
was very disagreeable   some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence 
with only one attempt on emma s side to talk of the weather 
but he made no answer   he was thinking   the result of his thoughts
appeared at last in these words 

 robert martin has no great loss  if he can but think so  and i
hope it will not be long before he does   your views for harriet
are best known to yourself  but as you make no secret of your love
of match making  it is fair to suppose that views  and plans 
and projects you have   and as a friend i shall just hint to you
that if elton is the man  i think it will be all labour in vain  

emma laughed and disclaimed   he continued 

 depend upon it  elton will not do   elton is a very good sort of man 
and a very respectable vicar of highbury  but not at all likely
to make an imprudent match   he knows the value of a good income
as well as any body   elton may talk sentimentally  but he will
act rationally   he is as well acquainted with his own claims  as you
can be with harriet s  he knows that he is a very handsome young man 
and a great favourite wherever he goes  and from his general way
of talking in unreserved moments  when there are only men present 
i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away 
i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family
of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with  who have all
twenty thousand pounds apiece  

 i am very much obliged to you   said emma  laughing again 
 if i had set my heart on mr  elton s marrying harriet  it would
have been very kind to open my eyes  but at present i only want
to keep harriet to myself   i have done with match making indeed 
i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls   i shall leave
off while i am well  

 good morning to you    said he  rising and walking off abruptly 
he was very much vexed   he felt the disappointment of the young man 
and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it  by the
sanction he had given  and the part which he was persuaded emma had
taken in the affair  was provoking him exceedingly 

emma remained in a state of vexation too  but there was more
indistinctness in the causes of her s  than in his   she did not always
feel so absolutely satisfied with herself  so entirely convinced that
her opinions were right and her adversary s wrong  as mr  knightley 
he walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her 
she was not so materially cast down  however  but that a little
time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives 
harriet s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy 
the possibility of the young man s coming to mrs  goddard s
that morning  and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause 
gave alarming ideas   the dread of such a failure after all became the
prominent uneasiness  and when harriet appeared  and in very good spirits 
and without having any such reason to give for her long absence 
she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind 
and convinced her  that let mr  knightley think or say what he would 
she had done nothing which woman s friendship and woman s feelings
would not justify 

he had frightened her a little about mr  elton  but when she considered
that mr  knightley could not have observed him as she had done 
neither with the interest  nor  she must be allowed to tell herself 
in spite of mr  knightley s pretensions  with the skill of such
an observer on such a question as herself  that he had spoken it
hastily and in anger  she was able to believe  that he had rather
said what he wished resentfully to be true  than what he knew
any thing about   he certainly might have heard mr  elton speak
with more unreserve than she had ever done  and mr  elton might not
be of an imprudent  inconsiderate disposition as to money matters 
he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them 
but then  mr  knightley did not make due allowance for the influence
of a strong passion at war with all interested motives   mr  knightley
saw no such passion  and of course thought nothing of its effects 
but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any
hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest 
and more than a reasonable  becoming degree of prudence  she was very
sure did not belong to mr  elton 

harriet s cheerful look and manner established hers  she came back 
not to think of mr  martin  but to talk of mr  elton   miss nash
had been telling her something  which she repeated immediately
with great delight   mr  perry had been to mrs  goddard s to attend
a sick child  and miss nash had seen him  and he had told miss nash 
that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park  he had met
mr  elton  and found to his great surprize  that mr  elton was
actually on his road to london  and not meaning to return till
the morrow  though it was the whist club night  which he had been
never known to miss before  and mr  perry had remonstrated with him
about it  and told him how shabby it was in him  their best player 
to absent himself  and tried very much to persuade him to put off
his journey only one day  but it would not do  mr  elton had been
determined to go on  and had said in a  very   particular  way indeed 
that he was going on business which he would not put off for any
inducement in the world  and something about a very enviable commission 
and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious   mr  perry
could not quite understand him  but he was very sure there must
be a  lady  in the case  and he told him so  and mr  elton only
looked very conscious and smiling  and rode off in great spirits 
miss nash had told her all this  and had talked a great deal more
about mr  elton  and said  looking so very significantly at her 
 that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be 
but she only knew that any woman whom mr  elton could prefer 
she should think the luckiest woman in the world  for  beyond a doubt 
mr  elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness  



chapter ix


mr  knightley might quarrel with her  but emma could not quarrel
with herself   he was so much displeased  that it was longer than
usual before he came to hartfield again  and when they did meet 
his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven   she was sorry 
but could not repent   on the contrary  her plans and proceedings
were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general
appearances of the next few days 

the picture  elegantly framed  came safely to hand soon after
mr  elton s return  and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common
sitting room  he got up to look at it  and sighed out his half sentences
of admiration just as he ought  and as for harriet s feelings  they were
visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment
as her youth and sort of mind admitted   emma was soon perfectly
satisfied of mr  martin s being no otherwise remembered  than as
he furnished a contrast with mr  elton  of the utmost advantage to the latter 

her views of improving her little friend s mind  by a great deal
of useful reading and conversation  had never yet led to more than
a few first chapters  and the intention of going on to morrow 
it was much easier to chat than to study  much pleasanter to let
her imagination range and work at harriet s fortune  than to be
labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts 
and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present 
the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life 
was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort
that she could meet with  into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper 
made up by her friend  and ornamented with ciphers and trophies 

in this age of literature  such collections on a very grand scale
are not uncommon   miss nash  head teacher at mrs  goddard s 
had written out at least three hundred  and harriet  who had taken
the first hint of it from her  hoped  with miss woodhouse s help 
to get a great many more   emma assisted with her invention 
memory and taste  and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand 
it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order  in form
as well as quantity 

mr  woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls 
and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in 
 so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young  he
wondered he could not remember them  but he hoped he should in time  
and it always ended in  kitty  a fair but frozen maid  

his good friend perry  too  whom he had spoken to on the subject 
did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind 
but he had desired perry to be upon the watch  and as he went about
so much  something  he thought  might come from that quarter 

it was by no means his daughter s wish that the intellects of
highbury in general should be put under requisition   mr  elton
was the only one whose assistance she asked   he was invited
to contribute any really good enigmas  charades  or conundrums
that he might recollect  and she had the pleasure of seeing him
most intently at work with his recollections  and at the same time 
as she could perceive  most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant 
nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass
his lips   they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles 
and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled 
and rather sentimentally recited  that well known charade 

    my first doth affliction denote 
      which my second is destin d to feel
    and my whole is the best antidote
      that affliction to soften and heal   

made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it
some pages ago already 

 why will not you write one yourself for us  mr  elton   said she 
 that is the only security for its freshness  and nothing could be
easier to you  

 oh no  he had never written  hardly ever  any thing of the kind
in his life   the stupidest fellow  he was afraid not even miss
woodhouse   he stopt a moment   or miss smith could inspire him  

the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration 
he called for a few moments  just to leave a piece of paper on the
table containing  as he said  a charade  which a friend of his had
addressed to a young lady  the object of his admiration  but which 
from his manner  emma was immediately convinced must be his own 

 i do not offer it for miss smith s collection   said he 
 being my friend s  i have no right to expose it in any degree
to the public eye  but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it  

the speech was more to emma than to harriet  which emma
could understand   there was deep consciousness about him 
and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend s 
he was gone the next moment   after another moment s pause 

 take it   said emma  smiling  and pushing the paper towards
harriet   it is for you   take your own  

but harriet was in a tremor  and could not touch it  and emma 
never loth to be first  was obliged to examine it herself 

        to miss  

          charade 

    my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings 
      lords of the earth  their luxury and ease 
    another view of man  my second brings 
      behold him there  the monarch of the seas 

    but ah  united  what reverse we have 
      man s boasted power and freedom  all are flown 
    lord of the earth and sea  he bends a slave 
      and woman  lovely woman  reigns alone 

      thy ready wit the word will soon supply 
      may its approval beam in that soft eye 

she cast her eye over it  pondered  caught the meaning  read it through
again to be quite certain  and quite mistress of the lines  and then
passing it to harriet  sat happily smiling  and saying to herself 
while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion
of hope and dulness   very well  mr  elton  very well indeed 
i have read worse charades    courtship   a very good hint   i give
you credit for it   this is feeling your way   this is saying very
plainly   pray  miss smith  give me leave to pay my addresses to you 
approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance  

      may its approval beam in that soft eye 

harriet exactly   soft is the very word for her eye  of all epithets 
the justest that could be given 

      thy ready wit the word will soon supply 

humph  harriet s ready wit  all the better   a man must be very much
in love  indeed  to describe her so   ah  mr  knightley  i wish
you had the benefit of this  i think this would convince you 
for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken 
an excellent charade indeed  and very much to the purpose 
things must come to a crisis soon now 

she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations 
which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length  by the
eagerness of harriet s wondering questions 

 what can it be  miss woodhouse   what can it be  i have not an idea  i
cannot guess it in the least   what can it possibly be  do try
to find it out  miss woodhouse   do help me   i never saw any thing
so hard   is it kingdom  i wonder who the friend was  and who could
be the young lady   do you think it is a good one  can it be woman 

      and woman  lovely woman  reigns alone 

can it be neptune 

      behold him there  the monarch of the seas 

or a trident  or a mermaid  or a shark  oh  no  shark is only
one syllable   it must be very clever  or he would not have brought it 
oh  miss woodhouse  do you think we shall ever find it out  

 mermaids and sharks  nonsense  my dear harriet  what are you
thinking of  where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made
by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark  give me the paper and listen 

for miss             read miss smith 

    my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings 
      lords of the earth  their luxury and ease 

that is  court  

    another view of man  my second brings 
      behold him there  the monarch of the seas 

that is  ship    plain as it can be   now for the cream 

    but ah  united    courtship   you know   what reverse we have 
      man s boasted power and freedom  all are flown 
    lord of the earth and sea  he bends a slave 
      and woman  lovely woman  reigns alone 

a very proper compliment   and then follows the application 
which i think  my dear harriet  you cannot find much difficulty
in comprehending   read it in comfort to yourself   there can
be no doubt of its being written for you and to you  

harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion 
she read the concluding lines  and was all flutter and happiness 
she could not speak   but she was not wanted to speak   it was enough
for her to feel   emma spoke for her 

 there is so pointed  and so particular a meaning in this compliment  
said she   that i cannot have a doubt as to mr  elton s intentions 
you are his object  and you will soon receive the completest proof
of it   i thought it must be so   i thought i could not be so deceived 
but now  it is clear  the state of his mind is as clear and decided 
as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you 
yes  harriet  just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance
to happen what has happened   i could never tell whether an attachment
between you and mr  elton were most desirable or most natural 
its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each
other  i am very happy   i congratulate you  my dear harriet  with all
my heart   this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride
in creating   this is a connexion which offers nothing but good 
it will give you every thing that you want  consideration  independence 
a proper home  it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends 
close to hartfield and to me  and confirm our intimacy for ever 
this  harriet  is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either
of us  

 dear miss woodhouse    and  dear miss woodhouse   was all that harriet 
with many tender embraces could articulate at first  but when they
did arrive at something more like conversation  it was sufficiently
clear to her friend that she saw  felt  anticipated  and remembered
just as she ought   mr  elton s superiority had very ample acknowledgment 

 whatever you say is always right   cried harriet   and therefore
i suppose  and believe  and hope it must be so  but otherwise i could
not have imagined it   it is so much beyond any thing i deserve 
mr  elton  who might marry any body  there cannot be two opinions
about  him    he is so very superior   only think of those sweet
verses   to miss            dear me  how clever   could it really
be meant for me  

 i cannot make a question  or listen to a question about that 
it is a certainty   receive it on my judgment   it is a sort
of prologue to the play  a motto to the chapter  and will be soon
followed by matter of fact prose  

 it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected   i am sure 
a month ago  i had no more idea myself   the strangest things do
take place  

 when miss smiths and mr  eltons get acquainted  they do indeed  and
really it is strange  it is out of the common course that what is
so evidently  so palpably desirable  what courts the pre arrangement
of other people  should so immediately shape itself into the proper form 
you and mr  elton are by situation called together  you belong
to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes 
your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls   there does
seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love
exactly the right direction  and sends it into the very channel
where it ought to flow 

      the course of true love never did run smooth  

a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage  

 that mr  elton should really be in love with me   me  of all people 
who did not know him  to speak to him  at michaelmas  and he 
the very handsomest man that ever was  and a man that every body
looks up to  quite like mr  knightley  his company so sought after 
that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he
does not chuse it  that he has more invitations than there are days
in the week   and so excellent in the church  miss nash has put down
all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury 
dear me  when i look back to the first time i saw him  how little
did i think   the two abbots and i ran into the front room and
peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by  and miss
nash came and scolded us away  and staid to look through herself 
however  she called me back presently  and let me look too 
which was very good natured  and how beautiful we thought he looked 
he was arm in arm with mr  cole  

 this is an alliance which  whoever  whatever your friends may be 
must be agreeable to them  provided at least they have common sense 
and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools   if they
are anxious to see you  happily  married  here is a man whose amiable
character gives every assurance of it   if they wish to have you
settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen
to place you in  here it will be accomplished  and if their only
object is that you should  in the common phrase  be  well  married 
here is the comfortable fortune  the respectable establishment 
the rise in the world which must satisfy them  

 yes  very true   how nicely you talk  i love to hear you 
you understand every thing   you and mr  elton are one as clever
as the other   this charade   if i had studied a twelvemonth 
i could never have made any thing like it  

 i thought he meant to try his skill  by his manner of declining
it yesterday  

 i do think it is  without exception  the best charade i ever read  

 i never read one more to the purpose  certainly  

 it is as long again as almost all we have had before  

 i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour 
such things in general cannot be too short  

harriet was too intent on the lines to hear   the most satisfactory
comparisons were rising in her mind 

 it is one thing   said she  presently  her cheeks in a glow   to
have very good sense in a common way  like every body else 
and if there is any thing to say  to sit down and write a letter 
and say just what you must  in a short way  and another  to write
verses and charades like this  

emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr  martin s prose 

 such sweet lines   continued harriet   these two last   but
how shall i ever be able to return the paper  or say i have found
it out   oh  miss woodhouse  what can we do about that  

 leave it to me   you do nothing   he will be here this evening 
i dare say  and then i will give it him back  and some nonsense
or other will pass between us  and you shall not be committed   your
soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming   trust to me  

 oh  miss woodhouse  what a pity that i must not write this beautiful
charade into my book  i am sure i have not got one half so good  

 leave out the two last lines  and there is no reason why you
should not write it into your book  

 oh  but those two lines are   

   the best of all   granted   for private enjoyment  and for private
enjoyment keep them   they are not at all the less written you know 
because you divide them   the couplet does not cease to be  nor does
its meaning change   but take it away  and all  appropriation  ceases 
and a very pretty gallant charade remains  fit for any collection 
depend upon it  he would not like to have his charade slighted 
much better than his passion   a poet in love must be encouraged in
both capacities  or neither   give me the book  i will write it down 
and then there can be no possible reflection on you  

harriet submitted  though her mind could hardly separate the parts 
so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down
a declaration of love   it seemed too precious an offering for any
degree of publicity 

 i shall never let that book go out of my own hands   said she 

 very well   replied emma   a most natural feeling  and the longer
it lasts  the better i shall be pleased   but here is my father
coming  you will not object to my reading the charade to him 
it will be giving him so much pleasure  he loves any thing of
the sort  and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment 
he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all   you must
let me read it to him  

harriet looked grave 

 my dear harriet  you must not refine too much upon this
charade   you will betray your feelings improperly  if you are
too conscious and too quick  and appear to affix more meaning 
or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it 
do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration 
if he had been anxious for secrecy  he would not have left the paper
while i was by  but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you 
do not let us be too solemn on the business   he has encouragement
enough to proceed  without our sighing out our souls over this charade  

 oh  no  i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it   do as you please  

mr  woodhouse came in  and very soon led to the subject again 
by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of  well  my dears 
how does your book go on   have you got any thing fresh  

 yes  papa  we have something to read you  something quite fresh 
a piece of paper was found on the table this morning   dropt 
we suppose  by a fairy   containing a very pretty charade  and we
have just copied it in  

she read it to him  just as he liked to have any thing read 
slowly and distinctly  and two or three times over  with explanations
of every part as she proceeded  and he was very much pleased  and 
as she had foreseen  especially struck with the complimentary conclusion 

 aye  that s very just  indeed  that s very properly said 
very true    woman  lovely woman   it is such a pretty charade 
my dear  that i can easily guess what fairy brought it   nobody
could have written so prettily  but you  emma  

emma only nodded  and smiled   after a little thinking 
and a very tender sigh  he added 

 ah  it is no difficulty to see who you take after  your dear mother
was so clever at all those things  if i had but her memory  but i
can remember nothing   not even that particular riddle which you
have heard me mention  i can only recollect the first stanza 
and there are several 

    kitty  a fair but frozen maid 
      kindled a flame i yet deplore 
    the hood wink d boy i called to aid 
    though of his near approach afraid 
      so fatal to my suit before 

and that is all that i can recollect of it  but it is very clever
all the way through   but i think  my dear  you said you had got it  

 yes  papa  it is written out in our second page   we copied it
from the elegant extracts   it was garrick s  you know  

 aye  very true   i wish i could recollect more of it 

    kitty  a fair but frozen maid 

the name makes me think of poor isabella  for she was very near
being christened catherine after her grandmama   i hope we shall
have her here next week   have you thought  my dear  where you
shall put her  and what room there will be for the children  

 oh  yes  she will have her own room  of course  the room she always
has   and there is the nursery for the children   just as usual 
you know   why should there be any change  

 i do not know  my dear  but it is so long since she was here   not
since last easter  and then only for a few days   mr  john knightley s
being a lawyer is very inconvenient   poor isabella   she is sadly
taken away from us all   and how sorry she will be when she comes 
not to see miss taylor here  

 she will not be surprized  papa  at least  

 i do not know  my dear   i am sure i was very much surprized
when i first heard she was going to be married  

 we must ask mr  and mrs  weston to dine with us  while isabella
is here  

 yes  my dear  if there is time   but   in a very depressed tone   she
is coming for only one week   there will not be time for any thing  

 it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer  but it seems a case
of necessity   mr  john knightley must be in town again on the 28th 
and we ought to be thankful  papa  that we are to have the whole
of the time they can give to the country  that two or three days
are not to be taken out for the abbey   mr  knightley promises
to give up his claim this christmas  though you know it is longer
since they were with him  than with us  

 it would be very hard  indeed  my dear  if poor isabella were
to be anywhere but at hartfield  

mr  woodhouse could never allow for mr  knightley s claims on
his brother  or any body s claims on isabella  except his own 
he sat musing a little while  and then said 

 but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back
so soon  though he does   i think  emma  i shall try and persuade
her to stay longer with us   she and the children might stay very well  

 ah  papa  that is what you never have been able to accomplish 
and i do not think you ever will   isabella cannot bear to stay
behind her husband  

this was too true for contradiction   unwelcome as it was  mr  woodhouse
could only give a submissive sigh  and as emma saw his spirits
affected by the idea of his daughter s attachment to her husband 
she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them 

 harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while
my brother and sister are here   i am sure she will be pleased
with the children   we are very proud of the children  are not we 
papa  i wonder which she will think the handsomest  henry or john  

 aye  i wonder which she will   poor little dears  how glad they
will be to come   they are very fond of being at hartfield  harriet  

 i dare say they are  sir   i am sure i do not know who is not  

 henry is a fine boy  but john is very like his mama   henry is the eldest 
he was named after me  not after his father   john  the second 
is named after his father   some people are surprized  i believe 
that the eldest was not  but isabella would have him called henry 
which i thought very pretty of her   and he is a very clever boy 
indeed   they are all remarkably clever  and they have so many
pretty ways   they will come and stand by my chair  and say 
 grandpapa  can you give me a bit of string   and once henry asked me
for a knife  but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas 
i think their father is too rough with them very often  

 he appears rough to you   said emma   because you are so very
gentle yourself  but if you could compare him with other papas 
you would not think him rough   he wishes his boys to be active and hardy 
and if they misbehave  can give them a sharp word now and then 
but he is an affectionate father  certainly mr  john knightley
is an affectionate father   the children are all fond of him  

 and then their uncle comes in  and tosses them up to the ceiling
in a very frightful way  

 but they like it  papa  there is nothing they like so much 
it is such enjoyment to them  that if their uncle did not lay down
the rule of their taking turns  whichever began would never give way
to the other  

 well  i cannot understand it  

 that is the case with us all  papa   one half of the world cannot
understand the pleasures of the other  

later in the morning  and just as the girls were going to separate
in preparation for the regular four o clock dinner  the hero
of this inimitable charade walked in again   harriet turned away 
but emma could receive him with the usual smile  and her quick eye
soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push  of
having thrown a die  and she imagined he was come to see how it
might turn up   his ostensible reason  however  was to ask whether
mr  woodhouse s party could be made up in the evening without him 
or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield 
if he were  every thing else must give way  but otherwise his friend
cole had been saying so much about his dining with him  had made
such a point of it  that he had promised him conditionally to come 

emma thanked him  but could not allow of his disappointing his
friend on their account  her father was sure of his rubber 
he re urged  she re declined  and he seemed then about to make
his bow  when taking the paper from the table  she returned it  

 oh  here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us 
thank you for the sight of it   we admired it so much  that i have
ventured to write it into miss smith s collection   your friend
will not take it amiss i hope   of course i have not transcribed
beyond the first eight lines  

mr  elton certainly did not very well know what to say 
he looked rather doubtingly  rather confused  said something about
 honour    glanced at emma and at harriet  and then seeing the book
open on the table  took it up  and examined it very attentively 
with the view of passing off an awkward moment  emma smilingly said 

 you must make my apologies to your friend  but so good a charade
must not be confined to one or two   he may be sure of every woman s
approbation while he writes with such gallantry  

 i have no hesitation in saying   replied mr  elton  though hesitating
a good deal while he spoke   i have no hesitation in saying  at
least if my friend feels at all as  i  do  i have not the smallest
doubt that  could he see his little effusion honoured as  i  see it 
 looking at the book again  and replacing it on the table   he
would consider it as the proudest moment of his life  

after this speech he was gone as soon as possible   emma could not
think it too soon  for with all his good and agreeable qualities 
there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt
to incline her to laugh   she ran away to indulge the inclination 
leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet s share 



chapter x


though now the middle of december  there had yet been no weather
to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise 
and on the morrow  emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor
sick family  who lived a little way out of highbury 

their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane  a lane
leading at right angles from the broad  though irregular  main street
of the place  and  as may be inferred  containing the blessed abode
of mr  elton   a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed 
and then  about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage 
an old and not very good house  almost as close to the road as it
could be   it had no advantage of situation  but had been very much
smartened up by the present proprietor  and  such as it was 
there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without
a slackened pace and observing eyes   emma s remark was  

 there it is   there go you and your riddle book one of these days    
harriet s was  

 oh  what a sweet house   how very beautiful   there are the yellow
curtains that miss nash admires so much  

 i do not often walk this way  now    said emma  as they proceeded 
 but  then  there will be an inducement  and i shall gradually get
intimately acquainted with all the hedges  gates  pools and pollards
of this part of highbury  

harriet  she found  had never in her life been within side the vicarage 
and her curiosity to see it was so extreme  that  considering exteriors
and probabilities  emma could only class it  as a proof of love 
with mr  elton s seeing ready wit in her 

 i wish we could contrive it   said she   but i cannot think
of any tolerable pretence for going in   no servant that i want
to inquire about of his housekeeper  no message from my father  

she pondered  but could think of nothing   after a mutual silence
of some minutes  harriet thus began again  

 i do so wonder  miss woodhouse  that you should not be married 
or going to be married  so charming as you are    

emma laughed  and replied 

 my being charming  harriet  is not quite enough to induce me to marry 
i must find other people charming  one other person at least 
and i am not only  not going to be married  at present  but have
very little intention of ever marrying at all  

 ah   so you say  but i cannot believe it  

 i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet 
to be tempted  mr  elton  you know   recollecting herself  
is out of the question   and i do  not  wish to see any such person 
i would rather not be tempted   i cannot really change for the better 
if i were to marry  i must expect to repent it  

 dear me   it is so odd to hear a woman talk so    

 i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry 
were i to fall in love  indeed  it would be a different thing 
but i never have been in love  it is not my way  or my nature 
and i do not think i ever shall   and  without love  i am sure i
should be a fool to change such a situation as mine   fortune i
do not want  employment i do not want  consequence i do not want 
i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their
husband s house as i am of hartfield  and never  never could i expect
to be so truly beloved and important  so always first and always
right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s  

 but then  to be an old maid at last  like miss bates  

 that is as formidable an image as you could present  harriet  and if i
thought i should ever be like miss bates  so silly  so satisfied  
so smiling  so prosing  so undistinguishing and unfastidious  
and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me 
i would marry to morrow  but between  us   i am convinced there never
can be any likeness  except in being unmarried  

 but still  you will be an old maid  and that s so dreadful  

 never mind  harriet  i shall not be a poor old maid  and it is
poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public 
a single woman  with a very narrow income  must be a ridiculous 
disagreeable old maid  the proper sport of boys and girls 
but a single woman  of good fortune  is always respectable 
and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else   and the
distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common
sense of the world as appears at first  for a very narrow income
has a tendency to contract the mind  and sour the temper 
those who can barely live  and who live perforce in a very small 
and generally very inferior  society  may well be illiberal and cross 
this does not apply  however  to miss bates  she is only too good
natured and too silly to suit me  but  in general  she is very
much to the taste of every body  though single and though poor 
poverty certainly has not contracted her mind   i really believe 
if she had only a shilling in the world  she would be very likely
to give away sixpence of it  and nobody is afraid of her   that is a
great charm  

 dear me  but what shall you do  how shall you employ yourself
when you grow old  

 if i know myself  harriet  mine is an active  busy mind  with a great
many independent resources  and i do not perceive why i should be
more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty 
woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then
as they are now  or with no important variation   if i draw less 
i shall read more  if i give up music  i shall take to carpet work 
and as for objects of interest  objects for the affections 
which is in truth the great point of inferiority  the want of which
is really the great evil to be avoided in  not  marrying  i shall
be very well off  with all the children of a sister i love so much 
to care about   there will be enough of them  in all probability 
to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need 
there will be enough for every hope and every fear  and though my
attachment to none can equal that of a parent  it suits my ideas
of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder   my nephews
and nieces   i shall often have a niece with me  

 do you know miss bates s niece   that is  i know you must have
seen her a hundred times  but are you acquainted  

 oh  yes  we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes
to highbury   by the bye   that  is almost enough to put one out
of conceit with a niece   heaven forbid  at least  that i should
ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together 
as she does about jane fairfax   one is sick of the very name
of jane fairfax   every letter from her is read forty times over 
her compliments to all friends go round and round again  and if she
does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher  or knit a pair
of garters for her grandmother  one hears of nothing else for a month 
i wish jane fairfax very well  but she tires me to death  

they were now approaching the cottage  and all idle topics
were superseded   emma was very compassionate  and the distresses
of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention
and kindness  her counsel and her patience  as from her purse 
she understood their ways  could allow for their ignorance and
their temptations  had no romantic expectations of extraordinary
virtue from those for whom education had done so little  entered into
their troubles with ready sympathy  and always gave her assistance
with as much intelligence as good will   in the present instance 
it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit 
and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice 
she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene
as made her say to harriet  as they walked away 

 these are the sights  harriet  to do one good   how trifling they
make every thing else appear   i feel now as if i could think of
nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day  and yet 
who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind  

 very true   said harriet    poor creatures  one can think
of nothing else  

 and really  i do not think the impression will soon be over  
said emma  as she crossed the low hedge  and tottering footstep
which ended the narrow  slippery path through the cottage garden 
and brought them into the lane again    i do not think it will  
stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place 
and recall the still greater within 

 oh  dear  no   said her companion 

they walked on   the lane made a slight bend  and when that bend
was passed  mr  elton was immediately in sight  and so near
as to give emma time only to say farther 

 ah   harriet  here comes a very sudden trial of our stability
in good thoughts   well   smiling   i hope it may be allowed that
if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers 
it has done all that is truly important   if we feel for the wretched 
enough to do all we can for them  the rest is empty sympathy 
only distressing to ourselves  

harriet could just answer   oh  dear  yes   before the gentleman
joined them   the wants and sufferings of the poor family  however 
were the first subject on meeting   he had been going to call
on them   his visit he would now defer  but they had a very
interesting parley about what could be done and should be done 
mr  elton then turned back to accompany them 

 to fall in with each other on such an errand as this   thought emma 
 to meet in a charitable scheme  this will bring a great increase
of love on each side   i should not wonder if it were to bring
on the declaration   it must  if i were not here   i wish i were
anywhere else  

anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could  she soon
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath  a little raised
on one side of the lane  leaving them together in the main road 
but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet s
habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too  and that 
in short  they would both be soon after her   this would not do 
she immediately stopped  under pretence of having some alteration
to make in the lacing of her half boot  and stooping down in complete
occupation of the footpath  begged them to have the goodness to walk on 
and she would follow in half a minute   they did as they were desired 
and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot 
she had the comfort of farther delay in her power  being overtaken
by a child from the cottage  setting out  according to orders 
with her pitcher  to fetch broth from hartfield   to walk by the side
of this child  and talk to and question her  was the most natural
thing in the world  or would have been the most natural  had she been
acting just then without design  and by this means the others were
still able to keep ahead  without any obligation of waiting for her 
she gained on them  however  involuntarily   the child s pace was quick 
and theirs rather slow  and she was the more concerned at it 
from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them 
mr  elton was speaking with animation  harriet listening with a very
pleased attention  and emma  having sent the child on  was beginning
to think how she might draw back a little more  when they both
looked around  and she was obliged to join them 

mr  elton was still talking  still engaged in some interesting detail 
and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he
was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday s
party at his friend cole s  and that she was come in herself for
the stilton cheese  the north wiltshire  the butter  the cellery 
the beet root  and all the dessert 

 this would soon have led to something better  of course   was her
consoling reflection   any thing interests between those who love 
and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart 
if i could but have kept longer away  

they now walked on together quietly  till within view of the vicarage
pales  when a sudden resolution  of at least getting harriet into
the house  made her again find something very much amiss about her boot 
and fall behind to arrange it once more   she then broke the lace
off short  and dexterously throwing it into a ditch  was presently
obliged to entreat them to stop  and acknowledged her inability to
put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort 

 part of my lace is gone   said she   and i do not know how i am
to contrive   i really am a most troublesome companion to you both 
but i hope i am not often so ill equipped  mr  elton  i must beg
leave to stop at your house  and ask your housekeeper for a bit
of ribband or string  or any thing just to keep my boot on  

mr  elton looked all happiness at this proposition  and nothing
could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into
his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage 
the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied 
and looking forwards  behind it was another with which it immediately
communicated  the door between them was open  and emma passed
into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most
comfortable manner   she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she
found it  but she fully intended that mr  elton should close it 
it was not closed  however  it still remained ajar  but by engaging
the housekeeper in incessant conversation  she hoped to make it
practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room 
for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself   it could
be protracted no longer   she was then obliged to be finished 
and make her appearance 

the lovers were standing together at one of the windows   it had a
most favourable aspect  and  for half a minute  emma felt the glory
of having schemed successfully   but it would not do  he had not
come to the point   he had been most agreeable  most delightful 
he had told harriet that he had seen them go by  and had purposely
followed them  other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt 
but nothing serious 

 cautious  very cautious   thought emma   he advances inch by inch 
and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure  

still  however  though every thing had not been accomplished
by her ingenious device  she could not but flatter herself
that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both 
and must be leading them forward to the great event 



chapter xi


mr  elton must now be left to himself   it was no longer in emma s
power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures 
the coming of her sister s family was so very near at hand 
that first in anticipation  and then in reality  it became henceforth
her prime object of interest  and during the ten days of their stay
at hartfield it was not to be expected  she did not herself expect  
that any thing beyond occasional  fortuitous assistance could
be afforded by her to the lovers   they might advance rapidly
if they would  however  they must advance somehow or other whether
they would or no   she hardly wished to have more leisure for them 
there are people  who the more you do for them  the less they will
do for themselves 

mr  and mrs  john knightley  from having been longer than usual
absent from surry  were exciting of course rather more than the
usual interest   till this year  every long vacation since their
marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey 
but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea bathing
for the children  and it was therefore many months since they had
been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions  or seen at all
by mr  woodhouse  who could not be induced to get so far as london 
even for poor isabella s sake  and who consequently was now most
nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit 

he thought much of the evils of the journey for her  and not a
little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to
bring some of the party the last half of the way  but his alarms
were needless  the sixteen miles being happily accomplished 
and mr  and mrs  john knightley  their five children  and a competent
number of nursery maids  all reaching hartfield in safety 
the bustle and joy of such an arrival  the many to be talked to 
welcomed  encouraged  and variously dispersed and disposed of 
produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne
under any other cause  nor have endured much longer even for this 
but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were
so respected by mrs  john knightley  that in spite of maternal
solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones 
and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance 
all the eating and drinking  and sleeping and playing 
which they could possibly wish for  without the smallest delay 
the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him 
either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them 

mrs  john knightley was a pretty  elegant little woman  of gentle 
quiet manners  and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate 
wrapt up in her family  a devoted wife  a doating mother 
and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that  but for
these higher ties  a warmer love might have seemed impossible 
she could never see a fault in any of them   she was not a woman
of strong understanding or any quickness  and with this resemblance
of her father  she inherited also much of his constitution 
was delicate in her own health  over careful of that of her children 
had many fears and many nerves  and was as fond of her own mr  wingfield
in town as her father could be of mr  perry   they were alike too 
in a general benevolence of temper  and a strong habit of regard
for every old acquaintance 

mr  john knightley was a tall  gentleman like  and very clever man 
rising in his profession  domestic  and respectable in his
private character  but with reserved manners which prevented his being
generally pleasing  and capable of being sometimes out of humour 
he was not an ill tempered man  not so often unreasonably cross
as to deserve such a reproach  but his temper was not his
great perfection  and  indeed  with such a worshipping wife 
it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not
be increased   the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his 
he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted 
and he could sometimes act an ungracious  or say a severe thing 

he was not a great favourite with his fair sister in law  nothing
wrong in him escaped her   she was quick in feeling the little
injuries to isabella  which isabella never felt herself 
perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been
flattering to isabella s sister  but they were only those of a calmly
kind brother and friend  without praise and without blindness 
but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her
regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes
fell into  the want of respectful forbearance towards her father 
there he had not always the patience that could have been wished 
mr  woodhouse s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking
him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill bestowed 
it did not often happen  for mr  john knightley had really a great
regard for his father in law  and generally a strong sense of what was
due to him  but it was too often for emma s charity  especially as
there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured 
though the offence came not   the beginning  however  of every visit
displayed none but the properest feelings  and this being of necessity
so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality 
they had not been long seated and composed when mr  woodhouse 
with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh  called his daughter s
attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last 

 ah  my dear   said he   poor miss taylor  it is a grievous business  

 oh yes  sir   cried she with ready sympathy   how you must
miss her   and dear emma  too   what a dreadful loss to you both   
i have been so grieved for you   i could not imagine how you could
possibly do without her   it is a sad change indeed   but i hope
she is pretty well  sir  

 pretty well  my dear  i hope  pretty well   i do not know
but that the place agrees with her tolerably  

mr  john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any
doubts of the air of randalls 

 oh  no  none in the least   i never saw mrs  weston better in my life  
never looking so well   papa is only speaking his own regret  

 very much to the honour of both   was the handsome reply 

 and do you see her  sir  tolerably often   asked isabella
in the plaintive tone which just suited her father 

mr  woodhouse hesitated    not near so often  my dear  as i could wish  

 oh  papa  we have missed seeing them but one entire day since
they married   either in the morning or evening of every day 
excepting one  have we seen either mr  weston or mrs  weston 
and generally both  either at randalls or here  and as you
may suppose  isabella  most frequently here   they are very 
very kind in their visits   mr  weston is really as kind as herself 
papa  if you speak in that melancholy way  you will be giving
isabella a false idea of us all   every body must be aware that miss
taylor must be missed  but every body ought also to be assured
that mr  and mrs  weston do really prevent our missing her by any
means to the extent we ourselves anticipated  which is the exact truth  

 just as it should be   said mr  john knightley   and just as i hoped
it was from your letters   her wish of shewing you attention could
not be doubted  and his being a disengaged and social man makes it
all easy   i have been always telling you  my love  that i had no idea
of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended 
and now you have emma s account  i hope you will be satisfied  

 why  to be sure   said mr  woodhouse   yes  certainly  i cannot deny
that mrs  weston  poor mrs  weston  does come and see us pretty often  
but then  she is always obliged to go away again  

 it would be very hard upon mr  weston if she did not  papa   
you quite forget poor mr  weston  

 i think  indeed   said john knightley pleasantly   that mr  weston
has some little claim   you and i  emma  will venture to take the part
of the poor husband   i  being a husband  and you not being a wife 
the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force 
as for isabella  she has been married long enough to see the convenience
of putting all the mr  westons aside as much as she can  

 me  my love   cried his wife  hearing and understanding only in part   
 are you talking about me   i am sure nobody ought to be  or can be 
a greater advocate for matrimony than i am  and if it had not been
for the misery of her leaving hartfield  i should never have thought
of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world 
and as to slighting mr  weston  that excellent mr  weston  i think
there is nothing he does not deserve   i believe he is one of the
very best tempered men that ever existed   excepting yourself
and your brother  i do not know his equal for temper   i shall
never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day
last easter  and ever since his particular kindness last september
twelvemonth in writing that note  at twelve o clock at night 
on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham 
i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor
a better man in existence   if any body can deserve him  it must be
miss taylor  

 where is the young man   said john knightley    has he been here
on this occasion  or has he not  

 he has not been here yet   replied emma    there was a strong
expectation of his coming soon after the marriage  but it ended
in nothing  and i have not heard him mentioned lately  

 but you should tell them of the letter  my dear   said her father 
 he wrote a letter to poor mrs  weston  to congratulate her 
and a very proper  handsome letter it was   she shewed it to me 
i thought it very well done of him indeed   whether it was his own idea
you know  one cannot tell   he is but young  and his uncle  perhaps   

 my dear papa  he is three and twenty  you forget how time passes  

 three and twenty   is he indeed   well  i could not have thought it  
and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother   well 
time does fly indeed   and my memory is very bad   however  it was
an exceeding good  pretty letter  and gave mr  and mrs  weston
a great deal of pleasure   i remember it was written from weymouth 
and dated sept  28th  and began   my dear madam   but i forget
how it went on  and it was signed  f  c  weston churchill    
i remember that perfectly  

 how very pleasing and proper of him   cried the good hearted mrs  john
knightley    i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man 
but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father 
there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his
parents and natural home   i never could comprehend how mr  weston
could part with him   to give up one s child   i really never
could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else  

 nobody ever did think well of the churchills  i fancy  
observed mr  john knightley coolly    but you need not imagine
mr  weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry
or john   mr  weston is rather an easy  cheerful tempered man 
than a man of strong feelings  he takes things as he finds them 
and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other  depending  i suspect 
much more upon what is called society for his comforts  that is 
upon the power of eating and drinking  and playing whist with his
neighbours five times a week  than upon family affection  or any
thing that home affords  

emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr  weston 
and had half a mind to take it up  but she struggled  and let
it pass   she would keep the peace if possible  and there was
something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits 
the all sufficiency of home to himself  whence resulted her brother s
disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse 
and those to whom it was important   it had a high claim to forbearance 



chapter xii


mr  knightley was to dine with them  rather against the inclination
of mr  woodhouse  who did not like that any one should share with him
in isabella s first day   emma s sense of right however had decided it 
and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother 
she had particular pleasure  from the circumstance of the late
disagreement between mr  knightley and herself  in procuring him
the proper invitation 

she hoped they might now become friends again   she thought it
was time to make up   making up indeed would not do    she  certainly
had not been in the wrong  and  he  would never own that he had 
concession must be out of the question  but it was time to appear
to forget that they had ever quarrelled  and she hoped it might rather
assist the restoration of friendship  that when he came into the room
she had one of the children with her  the youngest  a nice little girl
about eight months old  who was now making her first visit to hartfield 
and very happy to be danced about in her aunt s arms   it did assist 
for though he began with grave looks and short questions  he was soon
led on to talk of them all in the usual way  and to take the child
out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity 
emma felt they were friends again  and the conviction giving
her at first great satisfaction  and then a little sauciness 
she could not help saying  as he was admiring the baby 

 what a comfort it is  that we think alike about our nephews and nieces 
as to men and women  our opinions are sometimes very different 
but with regard to these children  i observe we never disagree  

 if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men
and women  and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your
dealings with them  as you are where these children are concerned 
we might always think alike  

 to be sure  our discordancies must always arise from my being
in the wrong  

 yes   said he  smiling   and reason good   i was sixteen years
old when you were born  

 a material difference then   she replied   and no doubt you were
much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives  but does
not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings
a good deal nearer  

 yes  a good deal  nearer   

 but still  not near enough to give me a chance of being right 
if we think differently  

 i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years  experience  and by
not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child   come  my dear emma 
let us be friends  and say no more about it   tell your aunt  little emma 
that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing
old grievances  and that if she were not wrong before  she is now  

 that s true   she cried   very true   little emma  grow up
a better woman than your aunt   be infinitely cleverer and not
half so conceited   now  mr  knightley  a word or two more  and i
have done   as far as good intentions went  we were  both  right 
and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet
proved wrong   i only want to know that mr  martin is not very 
very bitterly disappointed  

 a man cannot be more so   was his short  full answer 

 ah   indeed i am very sorry   come  shake hands with me  

this had just taken place and with great cordiality  when john
knightley made his appearance  and  how d ye do  george   and  john 
how are you   succeeded in the true english style  burying under
a calmness that seemed all but indifference  the real attachment
which would have led either of them  if requisite  to do every thing
for the good of the other 

the evening was quiet and conversable  as mr  woodhouse declined
cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his
dear isabella  and the little party made two natural divisions 
on one side he and his daughter  on the other the two mr  knightleys 
their subjects totally distinct  or very rarely mixing  and emma
only occasionally joining in one or the other 

the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits  but principally
of those of the elder  whose temper was by much the most communicative 
and who was always the greater talker   as a magistrate  he had
generally some point of law to consult john about  or  at least 
some curious anecdote to give  and as a farmer  as keeping in hand
the home farm at donwell  he had to tell what every field was to bear
next year  and to give all such local information as could not fail
of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been
the longest part of his life  and whose attachments were strong 
the plan of a drain  the change of a fence  the felling of a tree 
and the destination of every acre for wheat  turnips  or spring corn 
was entered into with as much equality of interest by john  as his
cooler manners rendered possible  and if his willing brother ever
left him any thing to inquire about  his inquiries even approached
a tone of eagerness 

while they were thus comfortably occupied  mr  woodhouse was enjoying
a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter 

 my poor dear isabella   said he  fondly taking her hand 
and interrupting  for a few moments  her busy labours for some one
of her five children   how long it is  how terribly long since you
were here   and how tired you must be after your journey   you must
go to bed early  my dear  and i recommend a little gruel to you
before you go   you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together 
my dear emma  suppose we all have a little gruel  

emma could not suppose any such thing  knowing as she did 
that both the mr  knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article
as herself   and two basins only were ordered   after a little
more discourse in praise of gruel  with some wondering at its
not being taken every evening by every body  he proceeded to say 
with an air of grave reflection 

 it was an awkward business  my dear  your spending the autumn
at south end instead of coming here   i never had much opinion
of the sea air  

 mr  wingfield most strenuously recommended it  sir  or we
should not have gone   he recommended it for all the children 
but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat   
both sea air and bathing  

 ah  my dear  but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her
any good  and as to myself  i have been long perfectly convinced 
though perhaps i never told you so before  that the sea is very
rarely of use to any body   i am sure it almost killed me once  

 come  come   cried emma  feeling this to be an unsafe subject   i must
beg you not to talk of the sea   it makes me envious and miserable   
i who have never seen it   south end is prohibited  if you please 
my dear isabella  i have not heard you make one inquiry about
mr  perry yet  and he never forgets you  

 oh  good mr  perry  how is he  sir  

 why  pretty well  but not quite well   poor perry is bilious 
and he has not time to take care of himself  he tells me he has
not time to take care of himself  which is very sad  but he is
always wanted all round the country   i suppose there is not a man
in such practice anywhere   but then there is not so clever a man
any where  

 and mrs  perry and the children  how are they  do the children grow 
i have a great regard for mr  perry   i hope he will be calling soon 
he will be so pleased to see my little ones  

 i hope he will be here to morrow  for i have a question or two to ask
him about myself of some consequence   and  my dear  whenever he comes 
you had better let him look at little bella s throat  

 oh  my dear sir  her throat is so much better that i have hardly
any uneasiness about it   either bathing has been of the greatest
service to her  or else it is to be attributed to an excellent
embrocation of mr  wingfield s  which we have been applying
at times ever since august  

 it is not very likely  my dear  that bathing should have been
of use to her  and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation 
i would have spoken to  

 you seem to me to have forgotten mrs  and miss bates   said emma 
 i have not heard one inquiry after them  

 oh  the good bateses  i am quite ashamed of myself  but you
mention them in most of your letters   i hope they are quite well 
good old mrs  bates  i will call upon her to morrow  and take
my children   they are always so pleased to see my children   
and that excellent miss bates   such thorough worthy people   
how are they  sir  

 why  pretty well  my dear  upon the whole   but poor mrs  bates
had a bad cold about a month ago  

 how sorry i am   but colds were never so prevalent as they have been
this autumn   mr  wingfield told me that he has never known them
more general or heavy  except when it has been quite an influenza  

 that has been a good deal the case  my dear  but not to the degree
you mention   perry says that colds have been very general 
but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november 
perry does not call it altogether a sickly season  

 no  i do not know that mr  wingfield considers it  very  sickly except  

 ah  my poor dear child  the truth is  that in london it is always
a sickly season   nobody is healthy in london  nobody can be 
it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there  so far off   
and the air so bad  

 no  indeed   we  are not at all in a bad air   our part of london is
very superior to most others   you must not confound us with london
in general  my dear sir   the neighbourhood of brunswick square
is very different from almost all the rest   we are so very airy 
i should be unwilling  i own  to live in any other part of the town   
there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my
children in   but  we  are so remarkably airy   mr  wingfield thinks
the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as
to air  

 ah  my dear  it is not like hartfield   you make the best of it  
but after you have been a week at hartfield  you are all of you
different creatures  you do not look like the same   now i cannot say 
that i think you are any of you looking well at present  

 i am sorry to hear you say so  sir  but i assure you  excepting those
little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely
free from anywhere  i am quite well myself  and if the children were
rather pale before they went to bed  it was only because they were
a little more tired than usual  from their journey and the happiness
of coming   i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow 
for i assure you mr  wingfield told me  that he did not believe
he had ever sent us off altogether  in such good case   i trust 
at least  that you do not think mr  knightley looking ill  
turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband 

 middling  my dear  i cannot compliment you   i think mr  john
knightley very far from looking well  

 what is the matter  sir   did you speak to me   cried mr  john
knightley  hearing his own name 

 i am sorry to find  my love  that my father does not think you
looking well  but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued 
i could have wished  however  as you know  that you had seen
mr  wingfield before you left home  

 my dear isabella    exclaimed he hastily   pray do not concern
yourself about my looks   be satisfied with doctoring and coddling
yourself and the children  and let me look as i chuse  

 i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother  
cried emma   about your friend mr  graham s intending to have a bailiff
from scotland  to look after his new estate   what will it answer 
will not the old prejudice be too strong  

and she talked in this way so long and successfully that  when forced
to give her attention again to her father and sister  she had nothing
worse to hear than isabella s kind inquiry after jane fairfax 
and jane fairfax  though no great favourite with her in general 
she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising 

 that sweet  amiable jane fairfax   said mrs  john knightley   
 it is so long since i have seen her  except now and then for a moment
accidentally in town   what happiness it must be to her good old
grandmother and excellent aunt  when she comes to visit them 
i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot
be more at highbury  but now their daughter is married  i suppose
colonel and mrs  campbell will not be able to part with her at all 
she would be such a delightful companion for emma  

mr  woodhouse agreed to it all  but added 

 our little friend harriet smith  however  is just such another
pretty kind of young person   you will like harriet   emma could
not have a better companion than harriet  

 i am most happy to hear it  but only jane fairfax one knows to be
so very accomplished and superior   and exactly emma s age  

this topic was discussed very happily  and others succeeded of
similar moment  and passed away with similar harmony  but the evening
did not close without a little return of agitation   the gruel came
and supplied a great deal to be said  much praise and many comments  
undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution 
and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was
never met with tolerable   but  unfortunately  among the failures
which the daughter had to instance  the most recent  and therefore
most prominent  was in her own cook at south end  a young woman
hired for the time  who never had been able to understand what she
meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel  thin  but not too thin 
often as she had wished for and ordered it  she had never been able
to get any thing tolerable   here was a dangerous opening 

 ah   said mr  woodhouse  shaking his head and fixing his eyes on
her with tender concern   the ejaculation in emma s ear expressed 
 ah  there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to
south end   it does not bear talking of    and for a little while
she hoped he would not talk of it  and that a silent rumination
might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel 
after an interval of some minutes  however  he began with 

 i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn 
instead of coming here  

 but why should you be sorry  sir   i assure you  it did the children
a great deal of good  

 and  moreover  if you must go to the sea  it had better not
have been to south end   south end is an unhealthy place 
perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end  

 i know there is such an idea with many people  but indeed it is
quite a mistake  sir   we all had our health perfectly well there 
never found the least inconvenience from the mud  and mr  wingfield
says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy 
and i am sure he may be depended on  for he thoroughly understands
the nature of the air  and his own brother and family have been
there repeatedly  

 you should have gone to cromer  my dear  if you went anywhere   
perry was a week at cromer once  and he holds it to be the best
of all the sea bathing places   a fine open sea  he says  and very
pure air   and  by what i understand  you might have had lodgings there
quite away from the sea  a quarter of a mile off  very comfortable 
you should have consulted perry  

 but  my dear sir  the difference of the journey   only consider how
great it would have been   an hundred miles  perhaps  instead of forty  

 ah  my dear  as perry says  where health is at stake  nothing else
should be considered  and if one is to travel  there is not much
to chuse between forty miles and an hundred   better not move at all 
better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get
into a worse air   this is just what perry said   it seemed to him
a very ill judged measure  

emma s attempts to stop her father had been vain  and when he
had reached such a point as this  she could not wonder at her
brother in law s breaking out 

 mr  perry   said he  in a voice of very strong displeasure 
 would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for 
why does he make it any business of his  to wonder at what i do   
at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another   i may
be allowed  i hope  the use of my judgment as well as mr  perry   
i want his directions no more than his drugs    he paused  
and growing cooler in a moment  added  with only sarcastic dryness 
 if mr  perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children
a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense
or inconvenience than a distance of forty  i should be as willing to
prefer cromer to south end as he could himself  

 true  true   cried mr  knightley  with most ready interposition  
 very true   that s a consideration indeed   but john  as to what i
was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham  of turning
it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows 
i cannot conceive any difficulty   i should not attempt it 
if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people 
but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path       
the only way of proving it  however  will be to turn to our maps 
i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope  and then we
will look them over  and you shall give me your opinion  

mr  woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on
his friend perry  to whom he had  in fact  though unconsciously 
been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions   
but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed
the present evil  and the immediate alertness of one brother 
and better recollections of the other  prevented any renewal of it 



chapter xiii


there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs  john
knightley  in this short visit to hartfield  going about every morning
among her old acquaintance with her five children  and talking
over what she had done every evening with her father and sister 
she had nothing to wish otherwise  but that the days did not pass
so swiftly   it was a delightful visit   perfect  in being much too short 

in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than
their mornings  but one complete dinner engagement  and out
of the house too  there was no avoiding  though at christmas 
mr  weston would take no denial  they must all dine at randalls
one day   even mr  woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible
thing in preference to a division of the party 

how they were all to be conveyed  he would have made a difficulty
if he could  but as his son and daughter s carriage and horses
were actually at hartfield  he was not able to make more than
a simple question on that head  it hardly amounted to a doubt 
nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one
of the carriages find room for harriet also 

harriet  mr  elton  and mr  knightley  their own especial set 
were the only persons invited to meet them   the hours were to be early 
as well as the numbers few  mr  woodhouse s habits and inclination
being consulted in every thing 

the evening before this great event  for it was a very great event
that mr  woodhouse should dine out  on the 24th of december  had been
spent by harriet at hartfield  and she had gone home so much indisposed
with a cold  that  but for her own earnest wish of being nursed
by mrs  goddard  emma could not have allowed her to leave the house 
emma called on her the next day  and found her doom already signed
with regard to randalls   she was very feverish and had a bad
sore throat   mrs  goddard was full of care and affection  mr  perry
was talked of  and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist
the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement 
though she could not speak of her loss without many tears 

emma sat with her as long as she could  to attend her in mrs  goddard s
unavoidable absences  and raise her spirits by representing how much
mr  elton s would be depressed when he knew her state  and left her
at last tolerably comfortable  in the sweet dependence of his having
a most comfortless visit  and of their all missing her very much 
she had not advanced many yards from mrs  goddard s door  when she
was met by mr  elton himself  evidently coming towards it  and as
they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid  
of whom he  on the rumour of considerable illness  had been going
to inquire  that he might carry some report of her to hartfield  
they were overtaken by mr  john knightley returning from the
daily visit to donwell  with his two eldest boys  whose healthy 
glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run  and seemed
to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they
were hastening home for   they joined company and proceeded together 
emma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint   
 a throat very much inflamed  with a great deal of heat about her 
a quick  low pulse   c   and she was sorry to find from mrs  goddard
that harriet was liable to very bad sore throats  and had often
alarmed her with them    mr  elton looked all alarm on the occasion 
as he exclaimed 

 a sore throat   i hope not infectious   i hope not of a putrid
infectious sort   has perry seen her   indeed you should take care
of yourself as well as of your friend   let me entreat you to run
no risks   why does not perry see her  

emma  who was not really at all frightened herself  tranquillised this
excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs  goddard s experience
and care  but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness
which she could not wish to reason away  which she would rather
feed and assist than not  she added soon afterwards  as if quite
another subject 

 it is so cold  so very cold  and looks and feels so very much
like snow  that if it were to any other place or with any other party 
i should really try not to go out to day  and dissuade my father
from venturing  but as he has made up his mind  and does not seem
to feel the cold himself  i do not like to interfere  as i know it
would be so great a disappointment to mr  and mrs  weston   but  upon
my word  mr  elton  in your case  i should certainly excuse myself 
you appear to me a little hoarse already  and when you consider
what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring 
i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home
and take care of yourself to night  

mr  elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make 
which was exactly the case  for though very much gratified by the kind
care of such a fair lady  and not liking to resist any advice of
her s  he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit   
but emma  too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions
and views to hear him impartially  or see him with clear vision 
was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its
being  very cold  certainly very cold   and walked on  rejoicing in
having extricated him from randalls  and secured him the power
of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening 

 you do quite right   said she    we will make your apologies
to mr  and mrs  weston  

but hardly had she so spoken  when she found her brother was civilly
offering a seat in his carriage  if the weather were mr  elton s
only objection  and mr  elton actually accepting the offer with much
prompt satisfaction   it was a done thing  mr  elton was to go 
and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than
at this moment  never had his smile been stronger  nor his eyes
more exulting than when he next looked at her 

 well   said she to herself   this is most strange   after i
had got him off so well  to chuse to go into company  and leave
harriet ill behind   most strange indeed   but there is  i believe 
in many men  especially single men  such an inclination  
such a passion for dining out  a dinner engagement is so high in
the class of their pleasures  their employments  their dignities 
almost their duties  that any thing gives way to it  and this must
be the case with mr  elton  a most valuable  amiable  pleasing young
man undoubtedly  and very much in love with harriet  but still 
he cannot refuse an invitation  he must dine out wherever he is asked 
what a strange thing love is  he can see ready wit in harriet 
but will not dine alone for her  

soon afterwards mr  elton quitted them  and she could not but do him
the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment
in his manner of naming harriet at parting  in the tone of his
voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs  goddard s
for news of her fair friend  the last thing before he prepared
for the happiness of meeting her again  when he hoped to be
able to give a better report  and he sighed and smiled himself
off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour 

after a few minutes of entire silence between them  john knightley
began with  

 i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than
mr  elton   it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned 
with men he can be rational and unaffected  but when he has ladies
to please  every feature works  

 mr  elton s manners are not perfect   replied emma   but where there
is a wish to please  one ought to overlook  and one does overlook
a great deal   where a man does his best with only moderate powers 
he will have the advantage over negligent superiority   there is
such perfect good temper and good will in mr  elton as one cannot
but value  

 yes   said mr  john knightley presently  with some slyness 
 he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you  

 me   she replied with a smile of astonishment   are you imagining
me to be mr  elton s object  

 such an imagination has crossed me  i own  emma  and if it never
occurred to you before  you may as well take it into consideration now  

 mr  elton in love with me   what an idea  

 i do not say it is so  but you will do well to consider whether
it is so or not  and to regulate your behaviour accordingly 
i think your manners to him encouraging   i speak as a friend 
emma   you had better look about you  and ascertain what you do 
and what you mean to do  

 i thank you  but i assure you you are quite mistaken   mr  elton
and i are very good friends  and nothing more   and she walked on 
amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often
arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances  of the mistakes
which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into 
and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind
and ignorant  and in want of counsel   he said no more 

mr  woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit 
that in spite of the increasing coldness  he seemed to have no idea
of shrinking from it  and set forward at last most punctually
with his eldest daughter in his own carriage  with less apparent
consciousness of the weather than either of the others  too full
of the wonder of his own going  and the pleasure it was to afford at
randalls to see that it was cold  and too well wrapt up to feel it 
the cold  however  was severe  and by the time the second carriage
was in motion  a few flakes of snow were finding their way down 
and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only
a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time 

emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour 
the preparing and the going abroad in such weather  with the sacrifice
of his children after dinner  were evils  were disagreeables at least 
which mr  john knightley did not by any means like  he anticipated
nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase 
and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in
expressing his discontent 

 a man   said he   must have a very good opinion of himself when
he asks people to leave their own fireside  and encounter such
a day as this  for the sake of coming to see him   he must think
himself a most agreeable fellow  i could not do such a thing 
it is the greatest absurdity  actually snowing at this moment   
the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home  and the
folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can 
if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this  by any call of
duty or business  what a hardship we should deem it   and here are we 
probably with rather thinner clothing than usual  setting forward
voluntarily  without excuse  in defiance of the voice of nature 
which tells man  in every thing given to his view or his feelings 
to stay at home himself  and keep all under shelter that he can   
here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another
man s house  with nothing to say or to hear that was not said
and heard yesterday  and may not be said and heard again to morrow 
going in dismal weather  to return probably in worse   four horses
and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle 
shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they
might have had at home  

emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent  which no doubt
he was in the habit of receiving  to emulate the  very true  my love  
which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion 
but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer
at all   she could not be complying  she dreaded being quarrelsome 
her heroism reached only to silence   she allowed him to talk 
and arranged the glasses  and wrapped herself up  without opening
her lips 

they arrived  the carriage turned  the step was let down 
and mr  elton  spruce  black  and smiling  was with them instantly 
emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject   mr  elton
was all obligation and cheerfulness  he was so very cheerful
in his civilities indeed  that she began to think he must have
received a different account of harriet from what had reached her 
she had sent while dressing  and the answer had been   much the same  
not better  

  my  report from mrs  goddard s   said she presently   was not
so pleasant as i had hoped   not better  was  my  answer  

his face lengthened immediately  and his voice was the voice
of sentiment as he answered 

 oh  no  i am grieved to find  i was on the point of telling you that
when i called at mrs  goddard s door  which i did the very last thing
before i returned to dress  i was told that miss smith was not better 
by no means better  rather worse   very much grieved and concerned  
i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial
as i knew had been given her in the morning  

emma smiled and answered   my visit was of use to the nervous part
of her complaint  i hope  but not even i can charm away a sore throat 
it is a most severe cold indeed   mr  perry has been with her 
as you probably heard  

 yes  i imagined  that is  i did not   

 he has been used to her in these complaints  and i hope to morrow
morning will bring us both a more comfortable report   but it is
impossible not to feel uneasiness   such a sad loss to our party to day  

 dreadful   exactly so  indeed   she will be missed every moment  

this was very proper  the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable 
but it should have lasted longer   emma was rather in dismay when
only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things 
and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment 

 what an excellent device   said he   the use of a sheepskin
for carriages   how very comfortable they make it   impossible to
feel cold with such precautions   the contrivances of modern days
indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete 
one is so fenced and guarded from the weather  that not a breath
of air can find its way unpermitted   weather becomes absolutely
of no consequence   it is a very cold afternoon  but in this carriage
we know nothing of the matter   ha  snows a little i see  

 yes   said john knightley   and i think we shall have a good deal
of it  

 christmas weather   observed mr  elton    quite seasonable 
and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not
begin yesterday  and prevent this day s party  which it might very
possibly have done  for mr  woodhouse would hardly have ventured had
there been much snow on the ground  but now it is of no consequence 
this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings   at christmas
every body invites their friends about them  and people think little
of even the worst weather   i was snowed up at a friend s house once
for a week   nothing could be pleasanter   i went for only one night 
and could not get away till that very day se nnight  

mr  john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure 
but said only  coolly 

 i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls  

at another time emma might have been amused  but she was too
much astonished now at mr  elton s spirits for other feelings 
harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party 

 we are sure of excellent fires   continued he   and every thing
in the greatest comfort   charming people  mr  and mrs  weston   
mrs  weston indeed is much beyond praise  and he is exactly
what one values  so hospitable  and so fond of society   
it will be a small party  but where small parties are select 
they are perhaps the most agreeable of any   mr  weston s dining room
does not accommodate more than ten comfortably  and for my part 
i would rather  under such circumstances  fall short by two than
exceed by two   i think you will agree with me   turning with a soft
air to emma   i think i shall certainly have your approbation 
though mr  knightley perhaps  from being used to the large parties
of london  may not quite enter into our feelings  

 i know nothing of the large parties of london  sir  i never dine
with any body  

 indeed   in a tone of wonder and pity   i had no idea that the
law had been so great a slavery   well  sir  the time must come
when you will be paid for all this  when you will have little
labour and great enjoyment  

 my first enjoyment   replied john knightley  as they passed through
the sweep gate   will be to find myself safe at hartfield again  



chapter xiv


some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman
as they walked into mrs  weston s drawing room   mr  elton must
compose his joyous looks  and mr  john knightley disperse his
ill humour  mr  elton must smile less  and mr  john knightley more 
to fit them for the place   emma only might be as nature prompted 
and shew herself just as happy as she was   to her it was real
enjoyment to be with the westons   mr  weston was a great favourite 
and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with
such unreserve  as to his wife  not any one  to whom she related
with such conviction of being listened to and understood  of being
always interesting and always intelligible  the little affairs 
arrangements  perplexities  and pleasures of her father and herself 
she could tell nothing of hartfield  in which mrs  weston had not
a lively concern  and half an hour s uninterrupted communication
of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private
life depends  was one of the first gratifications of each 

this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day s visit might
not afford  which certainly did not belong to the present half hour 
but the very sight of mrs  weston  her smile  her touch  her voice
was grateful to emma  and she determined to think as little as
possible of mr  elton s oddities  or of any thing else unpleasant 
and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost 

the misfortune of harriet s cold had been pretty well gone through
before her arrival   mr  woodhouse had been safely seated long
enough to give the history of it  besides all the history of his own
and isabella s coming  and of emma s being to follow  and had indeed
just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come
and see his daughter  when the others appeared  and mrs  weston 
who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him 
was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma 

emma s project of forgetting mr  elton for a while made her rather
sorry to find  when they had all taken their places  that he was
close to her   the difficulty was great of driving his strange
insensibility towards harriet  from her mind  while he not only sat
at her elbow  but was continually obtruding his happy countenance
on her notice  and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion 
instead of forgetting him  his behaviour was such that she could
not avoid the internal suggestion of  can it really be as my brother
imagined  can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer
his affections from harriet to me   absurd and insufferable    
yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm  would be
so interested about her father  and so delighted with mrs  weston 
and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal
and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would be lover 
and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners 
for her own sake she could not be rude  and for harriet s  in the hope
that all would yet turn out right  she was even positively civil 
but it was an effort  especially as something was going on amongst
the others  in the most overpowering period of mr  elton s nonsense 
which she particularly wished to listen to   she heard enough
to know that mr  weston was giving some information about his son 
she heard the words  my son   and  frank   and  my son  
repeated several times over  and  from a few other half syllables
very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from
his son  but before she could quiet mr  elton  the subject was
so completely past that any reviving question from her would have
been awkward 

now  it so happened that in spite of emma s resolution of never marrying 
there was something in the name  in the idea of mr  frank churchill 
which always interested her   she had frequently thought  especially since
his father s marriage with miss taylor  that if she  were  to marry 
he was the very person to suit her in age  character and condition 
he seemed by this connexion between the families  quite to belong to her 
she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew
them must think of   that mr  and mrs  weston did think of it  she was
very strongly persuaded  and though not meaning to be induced by him 
or by any body else  to give up a situation which she believed more
replete with good than any she could change it for  she had a great
curiosity to see him  a decided intention of finding him pleasant 
of being liked by him to a certain degree  and a sort of pleasure
in the idea of their being coupled in their friends  imaginations 

with such sensations  mr  elton s civilities were dreadfully ill timed 
but she had the comfort of appearing very polite  while feeling
very cross  and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not
possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again 
or the substance of it  from the open hearted mr  weston   so it proved   
for when happily released from mr  elton  and seated by mr  weston 
at dinner  he made use of the very first interval in the cares
of hospitality  the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton 
to say to her 

 we want only two more to be just the right number   i should
like to see two more here   your pretty little friend  miss smith 
and my son  and then i should say we were quite complete 
i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing room
that we are expecting frank   i had a letter from him this morning 
and he will be with us within a fortnight  

emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure  and fully assented
to his proposition of mr  frank churchill and miss smith making
their party quite complete 

 he has been wanting to come to us   continued mr  weston 
 ever since september   every letter has been full of it 
but he cannot command his own time   he has those to please
who must be pleased  and who  between ourselves  are sometimes
to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices   but now
i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january  

 what a very great pleasure it will be to you  and mrs  weston
is so anxious to be acquainted with him  that she must be almost
as happy as yourself  

 yes  she would be  but that she thinks there will be another
put off  she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do 
but she does not know the parties so well as i do   the case 
you see  is   but this is quite between ourselves   i did not mention
a syllable of it in the other room   there are secrets in all families 
you know   the case is  that a party of friends are invited to pay
a visit at enscombe in january  and that frank s coming depends upon
their being put off   if they are not put off  he cannot stir 
but i know they will  because it is a family that a certain lady 
of some consequence  at enscombe  has a particular dislike to 
and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or
three years  they always are put off when it comes to the point 
i have not the smallest doubt of the issue   i am as confident
of seeing frank here before the middle of january  as i am
of being here myself   but your good friend there  nodding
towards the upper end of the table  has so few vagaries herself 
and has been so little used to them at hartfield  that she cannot
calculate on their effects  as i have been long in the practice
of doing  

 i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case  
replied emma   but am disposed to side with you  mr  weston   if you
think he will come  i shall think so too  for you know enscombe  

 yes  i have some right to that knowledge  though i have never been
at the place in my life   she is an odd woman   but i never allow
myself to speak ill of her  on frank s account  for i do believe
her to be very fond of him   i used to think she was not capable
of being fond of any body  except herself   but she has always been
kind to him  in her way  allowing for little whims and caprices 
and expecting every thing to be as she likes   and it is no small credit 
in my opinion  to him  that he should excite such an affection 
for  though i would not say it to any body else  she has no more
heart than a stone to people in general  and the devil of a temper  

emma liked the subject so well  that she began upon it  to mrs  weston 
very soon after their moving into the drawing room  wishing her joy  
yet observing  that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming   
mrs  weston agreed to it  but added  that she should be very
glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting
at the time talked of    for i cannot depend upon his coming 
i cannot be so sanguine as mr  weston   i am very much afraid
that it will all end in nothing   mr  weston  i dare say  has been
telling you exactly how the matter stands  

 yes  it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour
of mrs  churchill  which i imagine to be the most certain
thing in the world  

 my emma   replied mrs  weston  smiling   what is the certainty
of caprice    then turning to isabella  who had not been
attending before   you must know  my dear mrs  knightley 
that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr  frank churchill 
in my opinion  as his father thinks   it depends entirely upon
his aunt s spirits and pleasure  in short  upon her temper 
to you  to my two daughters  i may venture on the truth 
mrs  churchill rules at enscombe  and is a very odd tempered woman 
and his coming now  depends upon her being willing to spare him  

 oh  mrs  churchill  every body knows mrs  churchill  
replied isabella    and i am sure i never think of that poor young
man without the greatest compassion   to be constantly living
with an ill tempered person  must be dreadful   it is what we
happily have never known any thing of  but it must be a life
of misery   what a blessing  that she never had any children 
poor little creatures  how unhappy she would have made them  

emma wished she had been alone with mrs  weston   she should then have
heard more   mrs  weston would speak to her  with a degree of unreserve
which she would not hazard with isabella  and  she really believed 
would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills
from her  excepting those views on the young man  of which her own
imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge 
but at present there was nothing more to be said   mr  woodhouse
very soon followed them into the drawing room  to be sitting
long after dinner  was a confinement that he could not endure 
neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him  and gladly did
he move to those with whom he was always comfortable 

while he talked to isabella  however  emma found an opportunity
of saying 

 and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any
means certain   i am sorry for it   the introduction must be unpleasant 
whenever it takes place  and the sooner it could be over  the better  

 yes  and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays 
even if this family  the braithwaites  are put off  i am still
afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us 
i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side  but i am sure
there is a great wish on the churchills  to keep him to themselves 
there is jealousy   they are jealous even of his regard for his father 
in short  i can feel no dependence on his coming  and i wish mr  weston
were less sanguine  

 he ought to come   said emma    if he could stay only a couple
of days  he ought to come  and one can hardly conceive a young man s
not having it in his power to do as much as that   a young  woman  
if she fall into bad hands  may be teazed  and kept at a distance
from those she wants to be with  but one cannot comprehend a young
 man  s being under such restraint  as not to be able to spend a week
with his father  if he likes it  

 one ought to be at enscombe  and know the ways of the family 
before one decides upon what he can do   replied mrs  weston 
 one ought to use the same caution  perhaps  in judging of the
conduct of any one individual of any one family  but enscombe 
i believe  certainly must not be judged by general rules 
 she  is so very unreasonable  and every thing gives way to her  

 but she is so fond of the nephew   he is so very great a favourite 
now  according to my idea of mrs  churchill  it would be most natural 
that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband 
to whom she owes every thing  while she exercises incessant caprice
towards  him   she should frequently be governed by the nephew 
to whom she owes nothing at all  

 my dearest emma  do not pretend  with your sweet temper 
to understand a bad one  or to lay down rules for it   you must
let it go its own way   i have no doubt of his having  at times 
considerable influence  but it may be perfectly impossible for him
to know beforehand  when  it will be  

emma listened  and then coolly said   i shall not be satisfied 
unless he comes  

 he may have a great deal of influence on some points  
continued mrs  weston   and on others  very little   and among those 
on which she is beyond his reach  it is but too likely  may be
this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us  



chapter xv


mr  woodhouse was soon ready for his tea  and when he had drank his
tea he was quite ready to go home  and it was as much as his three
companions could do  to entertain away his notice of the lateness
of the hour  before the other gentlemen appeared   mr  weston was
chatty and convivial  and no friend to early separations of any sort 
but at last the drawing room party did receive an augmentation 
mr  elton  in very good spirits  was one of the first to walk in 
mrs  weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa   he joined
them immediately  and  with scarcely an invitation  seated himself
between them 

emma  in good spirits too  from the amusement afforded her mind
by the expectation of mr  frank churchill  was willing to forget
his late improprieties  and be as well satisfied with him as before 
and on his making harriet his very first subject  was ready to listen
with most friendly smiles 

he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend  
her fair  lovely  amiable friend    did she know   had she
heard any thing about her  since their being at randalls   
he felt much anxiety  he must confess that the nature of her
complaint alarmed him considerably    and in this style he talked
on for some time very properly  not much attending to any answer 
but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat 
and emma was quite in charity with him 

but at last there seemed a perverse turn  it seemed all at once as if
he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account 
than on harriet s  more anxious that she should escape the infection 
than that there should be no infection in the complaint   he began
with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting
the sick chamber again  for the present  to entreat her to  promise 
 him  not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr  perry
and learnt his opinion  and though she tried to laugh it off
and bring the subject back into its proper course  there was no
putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her   she was vexed 
it did appear  there was no concealing it  exactly like the pretence
of being in love with her  instead of harriet  an inconstancy 
if real  the most contemptible and abominable  and she had difficulty
in behaving with temper   he turned to mrs  weston to implore
her assistance   would not she give him her support   would not she
add her persuasions to his  to induce miss woodhouse not to go
to mrs  goddard s till it were certain that miss smith s disorder
had no infection   he could not be satisfied without a promise  
would not she give him her influence in procuring it  

 so scrupulous for others   he continued   and yet so careless
for herself   she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to day 
and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated
sore throat herself   is this fair  mrs  weston   judge between us 
have not i some right to complain   i am sure of your kind support
and aid  

emma saw mrs  weston s surprize  and felt that it must be great 
at an address which  in words and manner  was assuming to himself
the right of first interest in her  and as for herself  she was
too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly
saying any thing to the purpose   she could only give him a look 
but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses 
and then left the sofa  removing to a seat by her sister  and giving
her all her attention 

she had not time to know how mr  elton took the reproof  so rapidly
did another subject succeed  for mr  john knightley now came
into the room from examining the weather  and opened on them
all with the information of the ground being covered with snow 
and of its still snowing fast  with a strong drifting wind 
concluding with these words to mr  woodhouse 

 this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements 
sir   something new for your coachman and horses to be making
their way through a storm of snow  

poor mr  woodhouse was silent from consternation  but every body else
had something to say  every body was either surprized or not surprized 
and had some question to ask  or some comfort to offer   mrs  weston
and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention
from his son in law  who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly 

 i admired your resolution very much  sir   said he   in venturing
out in such weather  for of course you saw there would be snow
very soon   every body must have seen the snow coming on 
i admired your spirit  and i dare say we shall get home very well 
another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable 
and we are two carriages  if one is blown over in the bleak part
of the common field there will be the other at hand   i dare say we
shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight  

mr  weston  with triumph of a different sort  was confessing that he
had known it to be snowing some time  but had not said a word 
lest it should make mr  woodhouse uncomfortable  and be an excuse
for his hurrying away   as to there being any quantity of snow fallen
or likely to fall to impede their return  that was a mere joke 
he was afraid they would find no difficulty   he wished the road might
be impassable  that he might be able to keep them all at randalls 
and with the utmost good will was sure that accommodation might
be found for every body  calling on his wife to agree with him 
that with a little contrivance  every body might be lodged 
which she hardly knew how to do  from the consciousness of there
being but two spare rooms in the house 

 what is to be done  my dear emma   what is to be done  
was mr  woodhouse s first exclamation  and all that he could say
for some time   to her he looked for comfort  and her assurances
of safety  her representation of the excellence of the horses 
and of james  and of their having so many friends about them 
revived him a little 

his eldest daughter s alarm was equal to his own   the horror of
being blocked up at randalls  while her children were at hartfield 
was full in her imagination  and fancying the road to be now just
passable for adventurous people  but in a state that admitted no delay 
she was eager to have it settled  that her father and emma should remain
at randalls  while she and her husband set forward instantly through
all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them 

 you had better order the carriage directly  my love   said she 
 i dare say we shall be able to get along  if we set off directly 
and if we do come to any thing very bad  i can get out and walk 
i am not at all afraid   i should not mind walking half the way 
i could change my shoes  you know  the moment i got home  and it is not
the sort of thing that gives me cold  

 indeed   replied he    then  my dear isabella  it is the most
extraordinary sort of thing in the world  for in general every
thing does give you cold   walk home   you are prettily shod
for walking home  i dare say   it will be bad enough for the horses  

isabella turned to mrs  weston for her approbation of the plan 
mrs  weston could only approve   isabella then went to emma 
but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being
all able to get away  and they were still discussing the point 
when mr  knightley  who had left the room immediately after his
brother s first report of the snow  came back again  and told them
that he had been out of doors to examine  and could answer for there
not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home  whenever they
liked it  either now or an hour hence   he had gone beyond the sweep  
some way along the highbury road  the snow was nowhere above half
an inch deep  in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground 
a very few flakes were falling at present  but the clouds were parting 
and there was every appearance of its being soon over   he had seen
the coachmen  and they both agreed with him in there being nothing
to apprehend 

to isabella  the relief of such tidings was very great  and they
were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father s account 
who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous
constitution allowed  but the alarm that had been raised could not
be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued
at randalls   he was satisfied of there being no present danger in
returning home  but no assurances could convince him that it was safe
to stay  and while the others were variously urging and recommending 
mr  knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences   thus  

 your father will not be easy  why do not you go  

 i am ready  if the others are  

 shall i ring the bell  

 yes  do  

and the bell was rung  and the carriages spoken for   a few
minutes more  and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion
deposited in his own house  to get sober and cool  and the other
recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over 

the carriage came   and mr  woodhouse  always the first object on
such occasions  was carefully attended to his own by mr  knightley
and mr  weston  but not all that either could say could prevent some
renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen 
and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for 
 he was afraid they should have a very bad drive   he was afraid
poor isabella would not like it   and there would be poor emma
in the carriage behind   he did not know what they had best do 
they must keep as much together as they could   and james was talked to 
and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage 

isabella stept in after her father  john knightley  forgetting that he
did not belong to their party  stept in after his wife very naturally 
so that emma found  on being escorted and followed into the second
carriage by mr  elton  that the door was to be lawfully shut on them 
and that they were to have a tete a tete drive   it would not have been
the awkwardness of a moment  it would have been rather a pleasure 
previous to the suspicions of this very day  she could have talked
to him of harriet  and the three quarters of a mile would have
seemed but one   but now  she would rather it had not happened 
she believed he had been drinking too much of mr  weston s good wine 
and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense 

to restrain him as much as might be  by her own manners  she was
immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity
of the weather and the night  but scarcely had she begun  scarcely had
they passed the sweep gate and joined the other carriage  than she
found her subject cut up  her hand seized  her attention demanded 
and mr  elton actually making violent love to her   availing himself
of the precious opportunity  declaring sentiments which must be already
well known  hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him 
but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled
love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect 
and in short  very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon
as possible   it really was so   without scruple  without apology  
without much apparent diffidence  mr  elton  the lover of harriet 
was professing himself  her  lover   she tried to stop him  but vainly 
he would go on  and say it all   angry as she was  the thought of
the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak 
she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness  and therefore
could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour 
accordingly  with a mixture of the serious and the playful  which she
hoped would best suit his half and half state  she replied 

 i am very much astonished  mr  elton   this to  me   you forget yourself  
you take me for my friend  any message to miss smith i shall
be happy to deliver  but no more of this to  me   if you please  

 miss smith   message to miss smith   what could she possibly mean    
and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent  such boastful
pretence of amazement  that she could not help replying with quickness 

 mr  elton  this is the most extraordinary conduct  and i can account
for it only in one way  you are not yourself  or you could not speak
either to me  or of harriet  in such a manner   command yourself
enough to say no more  and i will endeavour to forget it  

but mr  elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits 
not at all to confuse his intellects   he perfectly knew his own meaning 
and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious 
and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend   
but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned
at all   he resumed the subject of his own passion  and was very
urgent for a favourable answer 

as she thought less of his inebriety  she thought more of his inconstancy
and presumption  and with fewer struggles for politeness  replied 

 it is impossible for me to doubt any longer   you have made
yourself too clear   mr  elton  my astonishment is much beyond
any thing i can express   after such behaviour  as i have witnessed
during the last month  to miss smith  such attentions as i
have been in the daily habit of observing  to be addressing me
in this manner  this is an unsteadiness of character  indeed 
which i had not supposed possible   believe me  sir  i am far 
very far  from gratified in being the object of such professions  

 good heaven   cried mr  elton   what can be the meaning of this   
miss smith   i never thought of miss smith in the whole course
of my existence  never paid her any attentions  but as your friend 
never cared whether she were dead or alive  but as your friend 
if she has fancied otherwise  her own wishes have misled her 
and i am very sorry  extremely sorry  but  miss smith  indeed   oh 
miss woodhouse  who can think of miss smith  when miss woodhouse
is near   no  upon my honour  there is no unsteadiness of character 
i have thought only of you   i protest against having paid the smallest
attention to any one else   every thing that i have said or done 
for many weeks past  has been with the sole view of marking my
adoration of yourself   you cannot really  seriously  doubt it 
no    in an accent meant to be insinuating   i am sure you have seen
and understood me  

it would be impossible to say what emma felt  on hearing this  
which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost   she was
too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply 
and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr  elton s
sanguine state of mind  he tried to take her hand again  as he
joyously exclaimed  

 charming miss woodhouse  allow me to interpret this interesting silence 
it confesses that you have long understood me  

 no  sir   cried emma   it confesses no such thing   so far from
having long understood you  i have been in a most complete error
with respect to your views  till this moment   as to myself  i am
very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings  
nothing could be farther from my wishes  your attachment to my
friend harriet  your pursuit of her   pursuit  it appeared   gave me
great pleasure  and i have been very earnestly wishing you success 
but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield 
i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits
so frequent   am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend
yourself particularly to miss smith   that you have never thought
seriously of her  

 never  madam   cried he  affronted in his turn    never  i assure you 
 i  think seriously of miss smith   miss smith is a very good sort
of girl  and i should be happy to see her respectably settled 
i wish her extremely well   and  no doubt  there are men who might not
object to  every body has their level   but as for myself  i am not 
i think  quite so much at a loss   i need not so totally despair
of an equal alliance  as to be addressing myself to miss smith   
no  madam  my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only 
and the encouragement i received   

 encouragement   i give you encouragement   sir  you have been entirely
mistaken in supposing it   i have seen you only as the admirer
of my friend   in no other light could you have been more to me than
a common acquaintance   i am exceedingly sorry   but it is well that
the mistake ends where it does   had the same behaviour continued 
miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views 
not being aware  probably  any more than myself  of the very
great inequality which you are so sensible of   but  as it is 
the disappointment is single  and  i trust  will not be lasting 
i have no thoughts of matrimony at present  

he was too angry to say another word  her manner too decided
to invite supplication  and in this state of swelling resentment 
and mutually deep mortification  they had to continue together a few
minutes longer  for the fears of mr  woodhouse had confined them
to a foot pace  if there had not been so much anger  there would have
been desperate awkwardness  but their straightforward emotions left
no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment   without knowing
when the carriage turned into vicarage lane  or when it stopped 
they found themselves  all at once  at the door of his house 
and he was out before another syllable passed   emma then felt it
indispensable to wish him a good night   the compliment was just returned 
coldly and proudly  and  under indescribable irritation of spirits 
she was then conveyed to hartfield 

there she was welcomed  with the utmost delight  by her father 
who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from
vicarage lane  turning a corner which he could never bear to think of  
and in strange hands  a mere common coachman  no james  and there it
seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well 
for mr  john knightley  ashamed of his ill humour  was now all
kindness and attention  and so particularly solicitous for the comfort
of her father  as to seem  if not quite ready to join him in a basin
of gruel  perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome 
and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party 
except herself   but her mind had never been in such perturbation 
and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till
the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection 



chapter xvi


the hair was curled  and the maid sent away  and emma sat down to think
and be miserable   it was a wretched business indeed   such an overthrow
of every thing she had been wishing for   such a development of every
thing most unwelcome   such a blow for harriet   that was the worst
of all   every part of it brought pain and humiliation  of some sort
or other  but  compared with the evil to harriet  all was light 
and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken  
more in error  more disgraced by mis judgment  than she actually was 
could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself 

 if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man  i could have
borne any thing   he might have doubled his presumption to me  
but poor harriet  

how she could have been so deceived   he protested that he
had never thought seriously of harriet  never   she looked back
as well as she could  but it was all confusion   she had taken
up the idea  she supposed  and made every thing bend to it 
his manners  however  must have been unmarked  wavering  dubious 
or she could not have been so misled 

the picture   how eager he had been about the picture   
and the charade   and an hundred other circumstances   
how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet   to be sure 
the charade  with its  ready wit   but then the  soft eyes   
in fact it suited neither  it was a jumble without taste or truth 
who could have seen through such thick headed nonsense 

certainly she had often  especially of late  thought his manners
to herself unnecessarily gallant  but it had passed as his way 
as a mere error of judgment  of knowledge  of taste  as one proof
among others that he had not always lived in the best society 
that with all the gentleness of his address  true elegance
was sometimes wanting  but  till this very day  she had never 
for an instant  suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect
to her as harriet s friend 

to mr  john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on
the subject  for the first start of its possibility   there was
no denying that those brothers had penetration   she remembered
what mr  knightley had once said to her about mr  elton  the caution
he had given  the conviction he had professed that mr  elton would
never marry indiscreetly  and blushed to think how much truer
a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she
had reached herself   it was dreadfully mortifying  but mr  elton
was proving himself  in many respects  the very reverse of what she
had meant and believed him  proud  assuming  conceited  very full
of his own claims  and little concerned about the feelings of others 

contrary to the usual course of things  mr  elton s wanting
to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion 
his professions and his proposals did him no service   she thought
nothing of his attachment  and was insulted by his hopes 
he wanted to marry well  and having the arrogance to raise his
eyes to her  pretended to be in love  but she was perfectly easy
as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for 
there had been no real affection either in his language or manners 
sighs and fine words had been given in abundance  but she could
hardly devise any set of expressions  or fancy any tone of voice 
less allied with real love   she need not trouble herself to pity him 
he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself  and if miss woodhouse
of hartfield  the heiress of thirty thousand pounds  were not quite
so easily obtained as he had fancied  he would soon try for miss
somebody else with twenty  or with ten 

but  that he should talk of encouragement  should consider her as
aware of his views  accepting his attentions  meaning  in short  
to marry him   should suppose himself her equal in connexion
or mind   look down upon her friend  so well understanding the
gradations of rank below him  and be so blind to what rose above 
as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her   
it was most provoking 

perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he
was her inferior in talent  and all the elegancies of mind 
the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it 
but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly
his superior   he must know that the woodhouses had been settled
for several generations at hartfield  the younger branch
of a very ancient family  and that the eltons were nobody 
the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable 
being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate  to which all
the rest of highbury belonged  but their fortune  from other sources 
was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself 
in every other kind of consequence  and the woodhouses had long
held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which
mr  elton had first entered not two years ago  to make his way
as he could  without any alliances but in trade  or any thing
to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility   
but he had fancied her in love with him  that evidently must
have been his dependence  and after raving a little about the
seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head 
emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own
behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging  so full of
courtesy and attention  as  supposing her real motive unperceived 
might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy 
like mr  elton  in fancying himself a very decided favourite   if  she 
had so misinterpreted his feelings  she had little right to wonder
that  he   with self interest to blind him  should have mistaken hers 

the first error and the worst lay at her door   it was foolish 
it was wrong  to take so active a part in bringing any two
people together   it was adventuring too far  assuming too much 
making light of what ought to be serious  a trick of what ought
to be simple   she was quite concerned and ashamed  and resolved
to do such things no more 

 here have i   said she   actually talked poor harriet into being
very much attached to this man   she might never have thought of him
but for me  and certainly never would have thought of him with hope 
if i had not assured her of his attachment  for she is as modest
and humble as i used to think him   oh  that i had been satisfied with
persuading her not to accept young martin   there i was quite right 
that was well done of me  but there i should have stopped  and left
the rest to time and chance   i was introducing her into good company 
and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having 
i ought not to have attempted more   but now  poor girl  her peace
is cut up for some time   i have been but half a friend to her 
and if she were  not  to feel this disappointment so very much  i am
sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable
for her   william coxe  oh  no  i could not endure william coxe  
a pert young lawyer  

she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse  and then resumed
a more serious  more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been 
and might be  and must be   the distressing explanation she had
to make to harriet  and all that poor harriet would be suffering 
with the awkwardness of future meetings  the difficulties of
continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance  of subduing feelings 
concealing resentment  and avoiding eclat  were enough to occupy
her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer  and she went
to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having
blundered most dreadfully 

to youth and natural cheerfulness like emma s  though under
temporary gloom at night  the return of day will hardly fail
to bring return of spirits   the youth and cheerfulness of morning
are in happy analogy  and of powerful operation  and if the
distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed  they
will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope 

emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had
gone to bed  more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her 
and to depend on getting tolerably out of it 

it was a great consolation that mr  elton should not be really
in love with her  or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking
to disappoint him  that harriet s nature should not be of that
superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive  
and that there could be no necessity for any body s knowing
what had passed except the three principals  and especially
for her father s being given a moment s uneasiness about it 

these were very cheering thoughts  and the sight of a great deal
of snow on the ground did her further service  for any thing was
welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder
at present 

the weather was most favourable for her  though christmas day 
she could not go to church   mr  woodhouse would have been miserable
had his daughter attempted it  and she was therefore safe from
either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas 
the ground covered with snow  and the atmosphere in that unsettled
state between frost and thaw  which is of all others the most
unfriendly for exercise  every morning beginning in rain or snow 
and every evening setting in to freeze  she was for many days a most
honourable prisoner   no intercourse with harriet possible but by note 
no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day  and no
need to find excuses for mr  elton s absenting himself 

it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home 
and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort
in some society or other  it was very pleasant to have her father
so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house 
too wise to stir out  and to hear him say to mr  knightley  whom no
weather could keep entirely from them   

 ah   mr  knightley  why do not you stay at home like poor mr  elton  

these days of confinement would have been  but for her private
perplexities  remarkably comfortable  as such seclusion exactly
suited her brother  whose feelings must always be of great importance
to his companions  and he had  besides  so thoroughly cleared off
his ill humour at randalls  that his amiableness never failed him
during the rest of his stay at hartfield   he was always agreeable
and obliging  and speaking pleasantly of every body   but with all
the hopes of cheerfulness  and all the present comfort of delay 
there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation
with harriet  as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease 



chapter xvii


mr  and mrs  john knightley were not detained long at hartfield 
the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move 
and mr  woodhouse having  as usual  tried to persuade his daughter
to stay behind with all her children  was obliged to see the whole
party set off  and return to his lamentations over the destiny
of poor isabella   which poor isabella  passing her life with
those she doated on  full of their merits  blind to their faults 
and always innocently busy  might have been a model of right
feminine happiness 

the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note
from mr  elton to mr  woodhouse  a long  civil  ceremonious note 
to say  with mr  elton s best compliments   that he was proposing
to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath 
where  in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends 
he had engaged to spend a few weeks  and very much regretted
the impossibility he was under  from various circumstances of
weather and business  of taking a personal leave of mr  woodhouse 
of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense  
and had mr  woodhouse any commands  should be happy to attend to them  

emma was most agreeably surprized   mr  elton s absence just
at this time was the very thing to be desired   she admired
him for contriving it  though not able to give him much credit
for the manner in which it was announced   resentment could not
have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father 
from which she was so pointedly excluded   she had not even a
share in his opening compliments   her name was not mentioned   
and there was so striking a change in all this  and such an
ill judged solemnity of leave taking in his graceful acknowledgments 
as she thought  at first  could not escape her father s suspicion 

it did  however   her father was quite taken up with the surprize
of so sudden a journey  and his fears that mr  elton might never get
safely to the end of it  and saw nothing extraordinary in his language 
it was a very useful note  for it supplied them with fresh matter
for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening 
mr  woodhouse talked over his alarms  and emma was in spirits
to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude 

she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark   she had
reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold  and it was
desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting
the better of her other complaint before the gentleman s return 
she went to mrs  goddard s accordingly the very next day  to undergo
the necessary penance of communication  and a severe one it was   
she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously
feeding  to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred  
and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her
ideas on one subject  all her observations  all her convictions 
all her prophecies for the last six weeks 

the confession completely renewed her first shame  and the sight
of harriet s tears made her think that she should never be in charity
with herself again 

harriet bore the intelligence very well  blaming nobody  
and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition
and lowly opinion of herself  as must appear with particular
advantage at that moment to her friend 

emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost 
and all that was amiable  all that ought to be attaching 
seemed on harriet s side  not her own   harriet did not consider
herself as having any thing to complain of   the affection of such
a man as mr  elton would have been too great a distinction   
she never could have deserved him  and nobody but so partial
and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible 

her tears fell abundantly  but her grief was so truly artless 
that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma s eyes  
and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart
and understanding  really for the time convinced that harriet was
the superior creature of the two  and that to resemble her would
be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or
intelligence could do 

it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple minded
and ignorant  but she left her with every previous resolution
confirmed of being humble and discreet  and repressing imagination
all the rest of her life   her second duty now  inferior only to her
father s claims  was to promote harriet s comfort  and endeavour
to prove her own affection in some better method than by match making 
she got her to hartfield  and shewed her the most unvarying kindness 
striving to occupy and amuse her  and by books and conversation 
to drive mr  elton from her thoughts 

time  she knew  must be allowed for this being thoroughly done  and she
could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general 
and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr  elton
in particular  but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet s age 
and with the entire extinction of all hope  such a progress might be
made towards a state of composure by the time of mr  elton s return 
as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance 
without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them 

harriet did think him all perfection  and maintained the non existence
of any body equal to him in person or goodness  and did  in truth 
prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen 
but yet it appeared to her so natural  so inevitable to strive
against an inclination of that sort  unrequited   that she could not
comprehend its continuing very long in equal force 

if mr  elton  on his return  made his own indifference as evident
and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do 
she could not imagine harriet s persisting to place her happiness
in the sight or the recollection of him 

their being fixed  so absolutely fixed  in the same place  was bad
for each  for all three   not one of them had the power of removal 
or of effecting any material change of society   they must encounter
each other  and make the best of it 

harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at
mrs  goddard s  mr  elton being the adoration of all the teachers
and great girls in the school  and it must be at hartfield only
that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling
moderation or repellent truth   where the wound had been given 
there must the cure be found if anywhere  and emma felt that 
till she saw her in the way of cure  there could be no true peace
for herself 



chapter xviii


mr  frank churchill did not come   when the time proposed
drew near  mrs  weston s fears were justified in the arrival
of a letter of excuse   for the present  he could not be spared 
to his  very great mortification and regret  but still he looked
forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period  

mrs  weston was exceedingly disappointed  much more disappointed 
in fact  than her husband  though her dependence on seeing the
young man had been so much more sober   but a sanguine temper 
though for ever expecting more good than occurs  does not
always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression 
it soon flies over the present failure  and begins to hope again 
for half an hour mr  weston was surprized and sorry  but then he
began to perceive that frank s coming two or three months later
would be a much better plan  better time of year  better weather 
and that he would be able  without any doubt  to stay considerably
longer with them than if he had come sooner 

these feelings rapidly restored his comfort  while mrs  weston 
of a more apprehensive disposition  foresaw nothing but a repetition
of excuses and delays  and after all her concern for what her husband
was to suffer  suffered a great deal more herself 

emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really
about mr  frank churchill s not coming  except as a disappointment
at randalls   the acquaintance at present had no charm for her 
she wanted  rather  to be quiet  and out of temptation  but still  as it
was desirable that she should appear  in general  like her usual self 
she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance 
and enter as warmly into mr  and mrs  weston s disappointment 
as might naturally belong to their friendship 

she was the first to announce it to mr  knightley  and exclaimed
quite as much as was necessary   or  being acting a part  perhaps
rather more   at the conduct of the churchills  in keeping him away 
she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt  of the
advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry 
the pleasure of looking at somebody new  the gala day to highbury entire 
which the sight of him would have made  and ending with reflections
on the churchills again  found herself directly involved in a
disagreement with mr  knightley  and  to her great amusement 
perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her
real opinion  and making use of mrs  weston s arguments against herself 

 the churchills are very likely in fault   said mr  knightley 
coolly   but i dare say he might come if he would  

 i do not know why you should say so   he wishes exceedingly to come 
but his uncle and aunt will not spare him  

 i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming  if he made
a point of it   it is too unlikely  for me to believe it without proof  

 how odd you are   what has mr  frank churchill done  to make you
suppose him such an unnatural creature  

 i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature  in suspecting
that he may have learnt to be above his connexions  and to care
very little for any thing but his own pleasure  from living with
those who have always set him the example of it   it is a great deal
more natural than one could wish  that a young man  brought up
by those who are proud  luxurious  and selfish  should be proud 
luxurious  and selfish too   if frank churchill had wanted to see
his father  he would have contrived it between september and january 
a man at his age  what is he   three or four and twenty  cannot be
without the means of doing as much as that   it is impossible  

 that s easily said  and easily felt by you  who have always
been your own master   you are the worst judge in the world 
mr  knightley  of the difficulties of dependence   you do not know
what it is to have tempers to manage  

 it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty
should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount   he cannot
want money  he cannot want leisure   we know  on the contrary 
that he has so much of both  that he is glad to get rid of them at
the idlest haunts in the kingdom   we hear of him for ever at some
watering place or other   a little while ago  he was at weymouth 
this proves that he can leave the churchills  

 yes  sometimes he can  

 and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while 
whenever there is any temptation of pleasure  

 it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct  without an
intimate knowledge of their situation   nobody  who has not been
in the interior of a family  can say what the difficulties
of any individual of that family may be   we ought to be
acquainted with enscombe  and with mrs  churchill s temper 
before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do 
he may  at times  be able to do a great deal more than he can at others  

 there is one thing  emma  which a man can always do  if he chuses 
and that is  his duty  not by manoeuvring and finessing  but by vigour
and resolution   it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention
to his father   he knows it to be so  by his promises and messages 
but if he wished to do it  it might be done   a man who felt rightly
would say at once  simply and resolutely  to mrs  churchill  
 every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make
to your convenience  but i must go and see my father immediately 
i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him
on the present occasion   i shall  therefore  set off to morrow    
if he would say so to her at once  in the tone of decision becoming
a man  there would be no opposition made to his going  

 no   said emma  laughing   but perhaps there might be some made to his
coming back again   such language for a young man entirely dependent 
to use   nobody but you  mr  knightley  would imagine it possible 
but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly
opposite to your own   mr  frank churchill to be making such
a speech as that to the uncle and aunt  who have brought him up 
and are to provide for him   standing up in the middle of the room 
i suppose  and speaking as loud as he could   how can you imagine
such conduct practicable  

 depend upon it  emma  a sensible man would find no difficulty in it 
he would feel himself in the right  and the declaration  made 
of course  as a man of sense would make it  in a proper manner  
would do him more good  raise him higher  fix his interest stronger
with the people he depended on  than all that a line of shifts
and expedients can ever do   respect would be added to affection 
they would feel that they could trust him  that the nephew who had
done rightly by his father  would do rightly by them  for they know 
as well as he does  as well as all the world must know  that he
ought to pay this visit to his father  and while meanly exerting
their power to delay it  are in their hearts not thinking the better
of him for submitting to their whims   respect for right conduct
is felt by every body   if he would act in this sort of manner 
on principle  consistently  regularly  their little minds would bend
to his  

 i rather doubt that   you are very fond of bending little minds 
but where little minds belong to rich people in authority 
i think they have a knack of swelling out  till they are quite as
unmanageable as great ones   i can imagine  that if you  as you are 
mr  knightley  were to be transported and placed all at once in
mr  frank churchill s situation  you would be able to say and do
just what you have been recommending for him  and it might have
a very good effect   the churchills might not have a word to say
in return  but then  you would have no habits of early obedience
and long observance to break through   to him who has  it might
not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence 
and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought 
he may have as strong a sense of what would be right  as you can have 
without being so equal  under particular circumstances  to act up
to it  

 then it would not be so strong a sense   if it failed to produce
equal exertion  it could not be an equal conviction  

 oh  the difference of situation and habit   i wish you would try
to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel
in directly opposing those  whom as child and boy he has been
looking up to all his life  

 our amiable young man is a very weak young man  if this be the first
occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against
the will of others   it ought to have been a habit with him by
this time  of following his duty  instead of consulting expediency 
i can allow for the fears of the child  but not of the man 
as he became rational  he ought to have roused himself and shaken off
all that was unworthy in their authority   he ought to have opposed
the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father 
had he begun as he ought  there would have been no difficulty now  

 we shall never agree about him   cried emma   but that is
nothing extraordinary   i have not the least idea of his being
a weak young man   i feel sure that he is not   mr  weston would
not be blind to folly  though in his own son  but he is very likely
to have a more yielding  complying  mild disposition than would suit
your notions of man s perfection   i dare say he has  and though
it may cut him off from some advantages  it will secure him many others  

 yes  all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move 
and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure  and fancying himself
extremely expert in finding excuses for it   he can sit down and
write a fine flourishing letter  full of professions and falsehoods 
and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method
in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s
having any right to complain   his letters disgust me  

 your feelings are singular   they seem to satisfy every body else  

 i suspect they do not satisfy mrs  weston   they hardly can
satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings   standing in
a mother s place  but without a mother s affection to blind her 
it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due 
and she must doubly feel the omission   had she been a person
of consequence herself  he would have come i dare say  and it would
not have signified whether he did or no   can you think your friend
behindhand in these sort of considerations   do you suppose she
does not often say all this to herself   no  emma  your amiable
young man can be amiable only in french  not in english   he may be
very  aimable   have very good manners  and be very agreeable  but he
can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people 
nothing really amiable about him  

 you seem determined to think ill of him  

 me   not at all   replied mr  knightley  rather displeased   i do
not want to think ill of him   i should be as ready to acknowledge
his merits as any other man  but i hear of none  except what are
merely personal  that he is well grown and good looking  with smooth 
plausible manners  

 well  if he have nothing else to recommend him  he will be a
treasure at highbury   we do not often look upon fine young men 
well bred and agreeable   we must not be nice and ask for all
the virtues into the bargain   cannot you imagine  mr  knightley 
what a  sensation  his coming will produce   there will be but one subject
throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury  but one interest  
one object of curiosity  it will be all mr  frank churchill 
we shall think and speak of nobody else  

 you will excuse my being so much over powered  if i find him
conversable  i shall be glad of his acquaintance  but if he is only
a chattering coxcomb  he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts  

 my idea of him is  that he can adapt his conversation to the taste
of every body  and has the power as well as the wish of being
universally agreeable   to you  he will talk of farming  to me 
of drawing or music  and so on to every body  having that general
information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead 
or take the lead  just as propriety may require  and to speak
extremely well on each  that is my idea of him  

 and mine   said mr  knightley warmly   is  that if he turn out any
thing like it  he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing 
what  at three and twenty to be the king of his company  the great man  
the practised politician  who is to read every body s character 
and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his
own superiority  to be dispensing his flatteries around  that he
may make all appear like fools compared with himself   my dear emma 
your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came
to the point  

 i will say no more about him   cried emma   you turn every
thing to evil   we are both prejudiced  you against  i for him 
and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here  

 prejudiced   i am not prejudiced  

 but i am very much  and without being at all ashamed of it 
my love for mr  and mrs  weston gives me a decided prejudice in
his favour  

 he is a person i never think of from one month s end to another  
said mr  knightley  with a degree of vexation  which made emma
immediately talk of something else  though she could not comprehend
why he should be angry 

to take a dislike to a young man  only because he appeared to be
of a different disposition from himself  was unworthy the real
liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him 
for with all the high opinion of himself  which she had often laid
to his charge  she had never before for a moment supposed it could
make him unjust to the merit of another 




volume ii



chapter i


emma and harriet had been walking together one morning  and 
in emma s opinion  had been talking enough of mr  elton for that day 
she could not think that harriet s solace or her own sins required more 
and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject
as they returned   but it burst out again when she thought she
had succeeded  and after speaking some time of what the poor must
suffer in winter  and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive  
 mr  elton is so good to the poor   she found something else must be done 

they were just approaching the house where lived mrs  and miss bates 
she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers 
there was always sufficient reason for such an attention  mrs  and
miss bates loved to be called on  and she knew she was considered
by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her 
as rather negligent in that respect  and as not contributing what she
ought to the stock of their scanty comforts 

she had had many a hint from mr  knightley and some from her own heart 
as to her deficiency  but none were equal to counteract the persuasion
of its being very disagreeable   a waste of time  tiresome women  
and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second rate
and third rate of highbury  who were calling on them for ever 
and therefore she seldom went near them   but now she made the sudden
resolution of not passing their door without going in  observing 
as she proposed it to harriet  that  as well as she could calculate 
they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax 

the house belonged to people in business   mrs  and miss bates occupied
the drawing room floor  and there  in the very moderate sized apartment 
which was every thing to them  the visitors were most cordially
and even gratefully welcomed  the quiet neat old lady  who with her
knitting was seated in the warmest corner  wanting even to give up
her place to miss woodhouse  and her more active  talking daughter 
almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness  thanks for
their visit  solicitude for their shoes  anxious inquiries after
mr  woodhouse s health  cheerful communications about her mother s 
and sweet cake from the beaufet   mrs  cole had just been there 
just called in for ten minutes  and had been so good as to sit an
hour with them  and  she  had taken a piece of cake and been so kind
as to say she liked it very much  and  therefore  she hoped miss
woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too  

the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr  elton 
there was intimacy between them  and mr  cole had heard from
mr  elton since his going away   emma knew what was coming  they must
have the letter over again  and settle how long he had been gone 
and how much he was engaged in company  and what a favourite he
was wherever he went  and how full the master of the ceremonies 
ball had been  and she went through it very well  with all the
interest and all the commendation that could be requisite  and always
putting forward to prevent harriet s being obliged to say a word 

this she had been prepared for when she entered the house 
but meant  having once talked him handsomely over  to be no farther
incommoded by any troublesome topic  and to wander at large amongst
all the mistresses and misses of highbury  and their card parties 
she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr  elton 
but he was actually hurried off by miss bates  she jumped away
from him at last abruptly to the coles  to usher in a letter from
her niece 

 oh  yes  mr  elton  i understand  certainly as to dancing  
mrs  cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was  
mrs  cole was so kind as to sit some time with us  talking of jane 
for as soon as she came in  she began inquiring after her 
jane is so very great a favourite there   whenever she is with us 
mrs  cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough 
and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can 
and so she began inquiring after her directly  saying   i know you
cannot have heard from jane lately  because it is not her time
for writing   and when i immediately said   but indeed we have 
we had a letter this very morning   i do not know that i ever saw
any body more surprized    have you  upon your honour   said she 
 well  that is quite unexpected   do let me hear what she says   

emma s politeness was at hand directly  to say  with smiling interest  

 have you heard from miss fairfax so lately   i am extremely happy 
i hope she is well  

 thank you   you are so kind   replied the happily deceived aunt 
while eagerly hunting for the letter    oh  here it is   i was sure
it could not be far off  but i had put my huswife upon it  you see 
without being aware  and so it was quite hid  but i had it in my hand
so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table 
i was reading it to mrs  cole  and since she went away  i was
reading it again to my mother  for it is such a pleasure to her  
a letter from jane  that she can never hear it often enough 
so i knew it could not be far off  and here it is  only just under
my huswife  and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what
she says   but  first of all  i really must  in justice to jane 
apologise for her writing so short a letter  only two pages you see  
hardly two  and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half 
my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well 
she often says  when the letter is first opened   well  hetty 
now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker work   
don t you  ma am   and then i tell her  i am sure she would contrive
to make it out herself  if she had nobody to do it for her  
every word of it  i am sure she would pore over it till she had
made out every word   and  indeed  though my mother s eyes are not
so good as they were  she can see amazingly well still  thank god 
with the help of spectacles   it is such a blessing   my mother s
are really very good indeed   jane often says  when she is here 
 i am sure  grandmama  you must have had very strong eyes to see
as you do  and so much fine work as you have done too   i only wish
my eyes may last me as well   

all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath 
and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss
fairfax s handwriting 

 you are extremely kind   replied miss bates  highly gratified 
 you who are such a judge  and write so beautifully yourself 
i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure
as miss woodhouse s  my mother does not hear  she is a little deaf
you know   ma am   addressing her   do you hear what miss woodhouse
is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting  

and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment
repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it 
she was pondering  in the meanwhile  upon the possibility  without seeming
very rude  of making her escape from jane fairfax s letter  and had
almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse 
when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention 

 my mother s deafness is very trifling you see  just nothing at all 
by only raising my voice  and saying any thing two or three times over 
she is sure to hear  but then she is used to my voice   but it is very
remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me 
jane speaks so distinct   however  she will not find her grandmama
at all deafer than she was two years ago  which is saying a great
deal at my mother s time of life  and it really is full two years 
you know  since she was here   we never were so long without seeing
her before  and as i was telling mrs  cole  we shall hardly know
how to make enough of her now  

 are you expecting miss fairfax here soon  

 oh yes  next week  

 indeed   that must be a very great pleasure  

 thank you   you are very kind   yes  next week   every body is
so surprized  and every body says the same obliging things   i am
sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury  as they
can be to see her   yes  friday or saturday  she cannot say which 
because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one
of those days   so very good of them to send her the whole way 
but they always do  you know   oh yes  friday or saturday next 
that is what she writes about   that is the reason of her writing out
of rule  as we call it  for  in the common course  we should not have
heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday  

 yes  so i imagined   i was afraid there could be little chance
of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to day  

 so obliging of you   no  we should not have heard  if it had not
been for this particular circumstance  of her being to come here
so soon   my mother is so delighted   for she is to be three months
with us at least   three months  she says so  positively  as i
am going to have the pleasure of reading to you   the case is 
you see  that the campbells are going to ireland   mrs  dixon has
persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly 
they had not intended to go over till the summer  but she is so
impatient to see them again  for till she married  last october 
she was never away from them so much as a week  which must make
it very strange to be in different kingdoms  i was going to say 
but however different countries  and so she wrote a very urgent letter
to her mother  or her father  i declare i do not know which it was 
but we shall see presently in jane s letter  wrote in mr  dixon s
name as well as her own  to press their coming over directly 
and they would give them the meeting in dublin  and take them back
to their country seat  baly craig  a beautiful place  i fancy 
jane has heard a great deal of its beauty  from mr  dixon  i mean  
i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else 
but it was very natural  you know  that he should like to speak
of his own place while he was paying his addresses  and as jane used
to be very often walking out with them  for colonel and mrs  campbell
were very particular about their daughter s not walking out
often with only mr  dixon  for which i do not at all blame them 
of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell
about his own home in ireland  and i think she wrote us word
that he had shewn them some drawings of the place  views that he
had taken himself   he is a most amiable  charming young man 
i believe   jane was quite longing to go to ireland  from his account
of things  

at this moment  an ingenious and animating suspicion entering
emma s brain with regard to jane fairfax  this charming mr  dixon 
and the not going to ireland  she said  with the insidious design
of farther discovery 

 you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed
to come to you at such a time   considering the very particular
friendship between her and mrs  dixon  you could hardly have expected
her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs  campbell  

 very true  very true  indeed   the very thing that we have always
been rather afraid of  for we should not have liked to have her
at such a distance from us  for months together  not able to come
if any thing was to happen   but you see  every thing turns out
for the best   they want her  mr  and mrs  dixon  excessively to
come over with colonel and mrs  campbell  quite depend upon it 
nothing can be more kind or pressing than their  joint  invitation 
jane says  as you will hear presently  mr  dixon does not seem in the
least backward in any attention   he is a most charming young man 
ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth  when they were
out in that party on the water  and she  by the sudden whirling
round of something or other among the sails  would have been dashed
into the sea at once  and actually was all but gone  if he had not 
with the greatest presence of mind  caught hold of her habit  
 i can never think of it without trembling    but ever since we
had the history of that day  i have been so fond of mr  dixon  

 but  in spite of all her friends  urgency  and her own wish
of seeing ireland  miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you
and mrs  bates  

 yes  entirely her own doing  entirely her own choice  and colonel
and mrs  campbell think she does quite right  just what they
should recommend  and indeed they particularly  wish  her to try
her native air  as she has not been quite so well as usual lately  

 i am concerned to hear of it   i think they judge wisely 
but mrs  dixon must be very much disappointed   mrs  dixon 
i understand  has no remarkable degree of personal beauty  is not 
by any means  to be compared with miss fairfax  

 oh  no   you are very obliging to say such things  but certainly not 
there is no comparison between them   miss campbell always was
absolutely plain  but extremely elegant and amiable  

 yes  that of course  

 jane caught a bad cold  poor thing  so long ago as the 7th
of november   as i am going to read to you   and has never been
well since   a long time  is not it  for a cold to hang upon her 
she never mentioned it before  because she would not alarm us 
just like her  so considerate   but however  she is so far from well 
that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home 
and try an air that always agrees with her  and they have no doubt
that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her  
and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here 
than go to ireland  if she is unwell  nobody could nurse her  as we
should do  

 it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world  

 and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday  and the
campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following  
as you will find from jane s letter   so sudden   you may guess 
dear miss woodhouse  what a flurry it has thrown me in 
if it was not for the drawback of her illness  but i am afraid
we must expect to see her grown thin  and looking very poorly 
i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me  as to that 
i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first 
before i read them aloud to my mother  you know  for fear of there
being any thing in them to distress her   jane desired me to do it 
so i always do   and so i began to day with my usual caution 
but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell  than i
burst out  quite frightened  with  bless me  poor jane is ill    
which my mother  being on the watch  heard distinctly  and was sadly
alarmed at   however  when i read on  i found it was not near so bad
as i had fancied at first  and i make so light of it now to her 
that she does not think much about it   but i cannot imagine
how i could be so off my guard   if jane does not get well soon 
we will call in mr  perry   the expense shall not be thought of 
and though he is so liberal  and so fond of jane that i dare say
he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance  we could not
suffer it to be so  you know   he has a wife and family to maintain 
and is not to be giving away his time   well  now i have just given you
a hint of what jane writes about  we will turn to her letter  and i am
sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it
for her  

 i am afraid we must be running away   said emma  glancing at harriet 
and beginning to rise   my father will be expecting us 
i had no intention  i thought i had no power of staying more than
five minutes  when i first entered the house   i merely called 
because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs  bates 
but i have been so pleasantly detained   now  however  we must wish
you and mrs  bates good morning  

and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded 
she regained the street  happy in this  that though much had been
forced on her against her will  though she had in fact heard
the whole substance of jane fairfax s letter  she had been able
to escape the letter itself 



chapter ii


jane fairfax was an orphan  the only child of mrs  bates s
youngest daughter 

the marriage of lieut  fairfax of the         regiment of infantry 
and miss jane bates  had had its day of fame and pleasure 
hope and interest  but nothing now remained of it  save the melancholy
remembrance of him dying in action abroad  of his widow sinking
under consumption and grief soon afterwards  and this girl 

by birth she belonged to highbury   and when at three years old 
on losing her mother  she became the property  the charge 
the consolation  the fondling of her grandmother and aunt  there had
seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there 
of her being taught only what very limited means could command 
and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement 
to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person 
good understanding  and warm hearted  well meaning relations 

but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave
a change to her destiny   this was colonel campbell  who had
very highly regarded fairfax  as an excellent officer and most
deserving young man  and farther  had been indebted to him for
such attentions  during a severe camp fever  as he believed had saved
his life   these were claims which he did not learn to overlook 
though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax 
before his own return to england put any thing in his power 
when he did return  he sought out the child and took notice of her 
he was a married man  with only one living child  a girl 
about jane s age   and jane became their guest  paying them long visits
and growing a favourite with all  and before she was nine years old 
his daughter s great fondness for her  and his own wish of being
a real friend  united to produce an offer from colonel campbell
of undertaking the whole charge of her education   it was accepted 
and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbell s family 
and had lived with them entirely  only visiting her grandmother
from time to time 

the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others 
the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father
making independence impossible   to provide for her otherwise
was out of colonel campbell s power  for though his income  by pay
and appointments  was handsome  his fortune was moderate and must
be all his daughter s  but  by giving her an education  he hoped
to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter 

such was jane fairfax s history   she had fallen into good hands 
known nothing but kindness from the campbells  and been given
an excellent education   living constantly with right minded
and well informed people  her heart and understanding had received
every advantage of discipline and culture  and colonel campbell s
residence being in london  every lighter talent had been done
full justice to  by the attendance of first rate masters 
her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that
friendship could do  and at eighteen or nineteen she was  as far
as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children 
fully competent to the office of instruction herself  but she
was too much beloved to be parted with   neither father nor mother
could promote  and the daughter could not endure it   the evil day
was put off   it was easy to decide that she was still too young 
and jane remained with them  sharing  as another daughter  in all
the rational pleasures of an elegant society  and a judicious
mixture of home and amusement  with only the drawback of the future 
the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind
her that all this might soon be over 

the affection of the whole family  the warm attachment of miss
campbell in particular  was the more honourable to each party
from the circumstance of jane s decided superiority both in beauty
and acquirements   that nature had given it in feature could not
be unseen by the young woman  nor could her higher powers of mind
be unfelt by the parents   they continued together with unabated
regard however  till the marriage of miss campbell  who by that chance 
that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs 
giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior 
engaged the affections of mr  dixon  a young man  rich and agreeable 
almost as soon as they were acquainted  and was eligibly
and happily settled  while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn 

this event had very lately taken place  too lately for any thing to be
yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path
of duty  though she had now reached the age which her own judgment
had fixed on for beginning   she had long resolved that one and twenty
should be the period   with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate 
she had resolved at one and twenty to complete the sacrifice 
and retire from all the pleasures of life  of rational intercourse 
equal society  peace and hope  to penance and mortification for ever 

the good sense of colonel and mrs  campbell could not oppose such
a resolution  though their feelings did   as long as they lived 
no exertions would be necessary  their home might be hers for ever 
and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly 
but this would be selfishness   what must be at last  had better
be soon   perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder
and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay  and spared
her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must
now be relinquished   still  however  affection was glad to catch
at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment 
she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter s marriage 
and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength 
they must forbid her engaging in duties  which  so far from being
compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits  seemed 
under the most favourable circumstances  to require something
more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with
tolerable comfort 

with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland  her account
to her aunt contained nothing but truth  though there might be some
truths not told   it was her own choice to give the time of their
absence to highbury  to spend  perhaps  her last months of perfect
liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear 
and the campbells  whatever might be their motive or motives 
whether single  or double  or treble  gave the arrangement
their ready sanction  and said  that they depended more on a few
months spent in her native air  for the recovery of her health 
than on any thing else   certain it was that she was to come 
and that highbury  instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which
had been so long promised it  mr  frank churchill  must put up for
the present with jane fairfax  who could bring only the freshness
of a two years  absence 

emma was sorry   to have to pay civilities to a person she did
not like through three long months   to be always doing more than
she wished  and less than she ought   why she did not like jane
fairfax might be a difficult question to answer  mr  knightley
had once told her it was because she saw in her the really
accomplished young woman  which she wanted to be thought herself 
and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time 
there were moments of self examination in which her conscience could
not quite acquit her   but  she could never get acquainted with her 
she did not know how it was  but there was such coldness and reserve  
such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not  and then 
her aunt was such an eternal talker   and she was made such a fuss
with by every body   and it had been always imagined that they were
to be so intimate  because their ages were the same  every body had
supposed they must be so fond of each other    these were her reasons  
she had no better 

it was a dislike so little just  every imputed fault was so magnified
by fancy  that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any
considerable absence  without feeling that she had injured her 
and now  when the due visit was paid  on her arrival  after a two years 
interval  she was particularly struck with the very appearance
and manners  which for those two whole years she had been depreciating 
jane fairfax was very elegant  remarkably elegant  and she had
herself the highest value for elegance   her height was pretty 
just such as almost every body would think tall  and nobody could
think very tall  her figure particularly graceful  her size a most
becoming medium  between fat and thin  though a slight appearance
of ill health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two 
emma could not but feel all this  and then  her face  her features  
there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered 
it was not regular  but it was very pleasing beauty   her eyes 
a deep grey  with dark eye lashes and eyebrows  had never been denied
their praise  but the skin  which she had been used to cavil at 
as wanting colour  had a clearness and delicacy which really needed
no fuller bloom   it was a style of beauty  of which elegance
was the reigning character  and as such  she must  in honour 
by all her principles  admire it   elegance  which  whether of person
or of mind  she saw so little in highbury   there  not to be vulgar 
was distinction  and merit 

in short  she sat  during the first visit  looking at jane fairfax
with twofold complacency  the sense of pleasure and the sense
of rendering justice  and was determining that she would dislike
her no longer   when she took in her history  indeed  her situation 
as well as her beauty  when she considered what all this elegance
was destined to  what she was going to sink from  how she was going
to live  it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion
and respect  especially  if to every well known particular entitling
her to interest  were added the highly probable circumstance
of an attachment to mr  dixon  which she had so naturally started
to herself   in that case  nothing could be more pitiable
or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on 
emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced
mr  dixon s actions from his wife  or of any thing mischievous
which her imagination had suggested at first   if it were love 
it might be simple  single  successless love on her side alone 
she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison 
while a sharer of his conversation with her friend  and from the best 
the purest of motives  might now be denying herself this visit
to ireland  and resolving to divide herself effectually from
him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty 

upon the whole  emma left her with such softened  charitable feelings 
as made her look around in walking home  and lament that highbury
afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence 
nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her 

these were charming feelings  but not lasting   before she had
committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for
jane fairfax  or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices
and errors  than saying to mr  knightley   she certainly is handsome 
she is better than handsome    jane had spent an evening at hartfield
with her grandmother and aunt  and every thing was relapsing much
into its usual state   former provocations reappeared   the aunt
was as tiresome as ever  more tiresome  because anxiety for her
health was now added to admiration of her powers  and they had to
listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter
she ate for breakfast  and how small a slice of mutton for dinner 
as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her
mother and herself  and jane s offences rose again   they had music 
emma was obliged to play  and the thanks and praise which necessarily
followed appeared to her an affectation of candour  an air
of greatness  meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very
superior performance   she was  besides  which was the worst of all 
so cold  so cautious   there was no getting at her real opinion 
wrapt up in a cloak of politeness  she seemed determined
to hazard nothing   she was disgustingly  was suspiciously reserved 

if any thing could be more  where all was most  she was more
reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing 
she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr  dixon s character 
or her own value for his company  or opinion of the suitableness
of the match   it was all general approbation and smoothness 
nothing delineated or distinguished   it did her no service however 
her caution was thrown away   emma saw its artifice  and returned
to her first surmises   there probably  was  something more to conceal
than her own preference  mr  dixon  perhaps  had been very near
changing one friend for the other  or been fixed only to miss campbell 
for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds 

the like reserve prevailed on other topics   she and mr  frank churchill
had been at weymouth at the same time   it was known that they were
a little acquainted  but not a syllable of real information could emma
procure as to what he truly was    was he handsome     she believed
he was reckoned a very fine young man     was he agreeable    
 he was generally thought so     did he appear a sensible young man 
a young man of information     at a watering place  or in a common
london acquaintance  it was difficult to decide on such points 
manners were all that could be safely judged of  under a much longer
knowledge than they had yet had of mr  churchill   she believed
every body found his manners pleasing    emma could not forgive her 



chapter iii


emma could not forgive her   but as neither provocation nor resentment
were discerned by mr  knightley  who had been of the party  and had
seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side 
he was expressing the next morning  being at hartfield again on
business with mr  woodhouse  his approbation of the whole  not so
openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room 
but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma 
he had been used to think her unjust to jane  and had now great
pleasure in marking an improvement 

 a very pleasant evening   he began  as soon as mr  woodhouse
had been talked into what was necessary  told that he understood 
and the papers swept away    particularly pleasant   you and miss
fairfax gave us some very good music   i do not know a more
luxurious state  sir  than sitting at one s ease to be entertained
a whole evening by two such young women  sometimes with music
and sometimes with conversation   i am sure miss fairfax must
have found the evening pleasant  emma   you left nothing undone 
i was glad you made her play so much  for having no instrument
at her grandmother s  it must have been a real indulgence  

 i am happy you approved   said emma  smiling   but i hope i am
not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield  

 no  my dear   said her father instantly    that  i am sure you
are not   there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are 
if any thing  you are too attentive   the muffin last night  if it
had been handed round once  i think it would have been enough  

 no   said mr  knightley  nearly at the same time   you are not
often deficient  not often deficient either in manner or comprehension 
i think you understand me  therefore  

an arch look expressed   i understand you well enough   but she
said only   miss fairfax is reserved  

 i always told you she was  a little  but you will soon overcome
all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome  all that
has its foundation in diffidence   what arises from discretion
must be honoured  

 you think her diffident   i do not see it  

 my dear emma   said he  moving from his chair into one close
by her   you are not going to tell me  i hope  that you
had not a pleasant evening  

 oh  no  i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions 
and amused to think how little information i obtained  

 i am disappointed   was his only answer 

 i hope every body had a pleasant evening   said mr  woodhouse 
in his quiet way    i had   once  i felt the fire rather too much 
but then i moved back my chair a little  a very little  and it did
not disturb me   miss bates was very chatty and good humoured 
as she always is  though she speaks rather too quick   however 
she is very agreeable  and mrs  bates too  in a different way 
i like old friends  and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of
young lady  a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed 
she must have found the evening agreeable  mr  knightley  because she
had emma  

 true  sir  and emma  because she had miss fairfax  

emma saw his anxiety  and wishing to appease it  at least for
the present  said  and with a sincerity which no one could question  

 she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from 
i am always watching her to admire  and i do pity her from my heart  

mr  knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared
to express  and before he could make any reply  mr  woodhouse 
whose thoughts were on the bates s  said  

 it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined 
a great pity indeed  and i have often wished  but it is so little one
can venture to do  small  trifling presents  of any thing uncommon  
now we have killed a porker  and emma thinks of sending them
a loin or a leg  it is very small and delicate  hartfield pork is
not like any other pork  but still it is pork  and  my dear emma 
unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks  nicely fried 
as ours are fried  without the smallest grease  and not roast it 
for no stomach can bear roast pork  i think we had better send the leg  
do not you think so  my dear  

 my dear papa  i sent the whole hind quarter  i knew you would wish it 
there will be the leg to be salted  you know  which is so very nice 
and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like  

 that s right  my dear  very right   i had not thought of it before 
but that is the best way   they must not over salt the leg  and then 
if it is not over salted  and if it is very thoroughly boiled 
just as serle boils ours  and eaten very moderately of  with a
boiled turnip  and a little carrot or parsnip  i do not consider
it unwholesome  

 emma   said mr  knightley presently   i have a piece of news for you 
you like news  and i heard an article in my way hither that i think
will interest you  

 news   oh  yes  i always like news   what is it   why do you
smile so   where did you hear it   at randalls  

he had time only to say 

 no  not at randalls  i have not been near randalls   when the door
was thrown open  and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room 
full of thanks  and full of news  miss bates knew not which to
give quickest   mr  knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment 
and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him 

 oh  my dear sir  how are you this morning   my dear miss woodhouse  
i come quite over powered  such a beautiful hind quarter of pork 
you are too bountiful   have you heard the news   mr  elton is going
to be married  

emma had not had time even to think of mr  elton  and she was
so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start 
and a little blush  at the sound 

 there is my news   i thought it would interest you  
said mr  knightley  with a smile which implied a conviction
of some part of what had passed between them 

 but where could  you  hear it   cried miss bates    where could
you possibly hear it  mr  knightley   for it is not five minutes
since i received mrs  cole s note  no  it cannot be more than five  
or at least ten  for i had got my bonnet and spencer on  just ready
to come out  i was only gone down to speak to patty again about
the pork  jane was standing in the passage  were not you  jane   
for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan
large enough   so i said i would go down and see  and jane said 
 shall i go down instead  for i think you have a little cold 
and patty has been washing the kitchen     oh  my dear  
said i  well  and just then came the note   a miss hawkins  
that s all i know   a miss hawkins of bath   but  mr  knightley 
how could you possibly have heard it  for the very moment mr  cole
told mrs  cole of it  she sat down and wrote to me   a miss hawkins   

 i was with mr  cole on business an hour and a half ago 
he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in  and handed it
to me directly  

 well  that is quite  i suppose there never was a piece of news more
generally interesting   my dear sir  you really are too bountiful 
my mother desires her very best compliments and regards  and a
thousand thanks  and says you really quite oppress her  

 we consider our hartfield pork   replied mr  woodhouse   indeed it
certainly is  so very superior to all other pork  that emma and i
cannot have a greater pleasure than   

 oh  my dear sir  as my mother says  our friends are only too good
to us   if ever there were people who  without having great wealth
themselves  had every thing they could wish for  i am sure it is us 
we may well say that  our lot is cast in a goodly heritage  
well  mr  knightley  and so you actually saw the letter  well   

 it was short  merely to announce  but cheerful  exulting  of course    
here was a sly glance at emma    he had been so fortunate as to  
i forget the precise words  one has no business to remember them 
the information was  as you state  that he was going to be married
to a miss hawkins   by his style  i should imagine it just settled  

 mr  elton going to be married   said emma  as soon as she could speak 
 he will have every body s wishes for his happiness  

 he is very young to settle   was mr  woodhouse s observation 
 he had better not be in a hurry   he seemed to me very well off
as he was   we were always glad to see him at hartfield  

 a new neighbour for us all  miss woodhouse   said miss bates 
joyfully   my mother is so pleased   she says she cannot
bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress 
this is great news  indeed   jane  you have never seen
mr  elton   no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him  

jane s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly
to occupy her 

 no  i have never seen mr  elton   she replied  starting on this appeal 
 is he  is he a tall man  

 who shall answer that question   cried emma    my father would
say  yes   mr  knightley  no   and miss bates and i that he is
just the happy medium   when you have been here a little longer 
miss fairfax  you will understand that mr  elton is the standard
of perfection in highbury  both in person and mind  

 very true  miss woodhouse  so she will   he is the very best
young man  but  my dear jane  if you remember  i told you yesterday
he was precisely the height of mr  perry   miss hawkins   i dare say 
an excellent young woman   his extreme attention to my mother  
wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew  that she might hear the better 
for my mother is a little deaf  you know  it is not much  but she
does not hear quite quick   jane says that colonel campbell is a
little deaf   he fancied bathing might be good for it  the warm bath  
but she says it did him no lasting benefit   colonel campbell 
you know  is quite our angel   and mr  dixon seems a very charming
young man  quite worthy of him   it is such a happiness when good
people get together  and they always do   now  here will be mr  elton
and miss hawkins  and there are the coles  such very good people 
and the perrys  i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple
than mr  and mrs  perry   i say  sir   turning to mr  woodhouse 
 i think there are few places with such society as highbury 
i always say  we are quite blessed in our neighbours   my dear sir 
if there is one thing my mother loves better than another  it is pork  
a roast loin of pork   

 as to who  or what miss hawkins is  or how long he has been
acquainted with her   said emma   nothing i suppose can be known 
one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance   he has been
gone only four weeks  

nobody had any information to give  and  after a few more wonderings 
emma said 

 you are silent  miss fairfax  but i hope you mean to take
an interest in this news   you  who have been hearing and seeing
so much of late on these subjects  who must have been so deep
in the business on miss campbell s account  we shall not excuse
your being indifferent about mr  elton and miss hawkins  

 when i have seen mr  elton   replied jane   i dare say i
shall be interested  but i believe it requires  that  with me 
and as it is some months since miss campbell married  the impression
may be a little worn off  

 yes  he has been gone just four weeks  as you observe  miss woodhouse  
said miss bates   four weeks yesterday   a miss hawkins   well  i had
always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts 
not that i ever  mrs  cole once whispered to me  but i immediately said 
 no  mr  elton is a most worthy young man  but   in short  i do
not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries 
i do not pretend to it   what is before me  i see   at the same time 
nobody could wonder if mr  elton should have aspired  miss woodhouse
lets me chatter on  so good humouredly  she knows i would not
offend for the world   how does miss smith do   she seems quite
recovered now   have you heard from mrs  john knightley lately 
oh  those dear little children   jane  do you know i always fancy
mr  dixon like mr  john knightley   i mean in person  tall  and with
that sort of look  and not very talkative  

 quite wrong  my dear aunt  there is no likeness at all  

 very odd  but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand 
one takes up a notion  and runs away with it   mr  dixon  you say 
is not  strictly speaking  handsome  

 handsome   oh  no  far from it  certainly plain   i told you he
was plain  

 my dear  you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain 
and that you yourself   

 oh  as for me  my judgment is worth nothing   where i have a regard 
i always think a person well looking  but i gave what i believed
the general opinion  when i called him plain  

 well  my dear jane  i believe we must be running away 
the weather does not look well  and grandmama will be uneasy 
you are too obliging  my dear miss woodhouse  but we really must
take leave   this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed 
i shall just go round by mrs  cole s  but i shall not stop three minutes 
and  jane  you had better go home directly  i would not have you
out in a shower   we think she is the better for highbury already 
thank you  we do indeed   i shall not attempt calling on mrs  goddard 
for i really do not think she cares for any thing but  boiled  pork 
when we dress the leg it will be another thing   good morning to you 
my dear sir   oh   mr  knightley is coming too   well  that is
so very   i am sure if jane is tired  you will be so kind as to
give her your arm   mr  elton  and miss hawkins   good morning
to you  

emma  alone with her father  had half her attention wanted by him
while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry  
and to marry strangers too  and the other half she could give
to her own view of the subject   it was to herself an amusing
and a very welcome piece of news  as proving that mr  elton
could not have suffered long  but she was sorry for harriet 
harriet must feel it  and all that she could hope was  by giving
the first information herself  to save her from hearing it abruptly
from others   it was now about the time that she was likely to call 
if she were to meet miss bates in her way   and upon its beginning
to rain  emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be
detaining her at mrs  goddard s  and that the intelligence would
undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation 

the shower was heavy  but short  and it had not been over five minutes 
when in came harriet  with just the heated  agitated look which
hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give  and the
 oh  miss woodhouse  what do you think has happened   which instantly
burst forth  had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation 
as the blow was given  emma felt that she could not now shew greater
kindness than in listening  and harriet  unchecked  ran eagerly
through what she had to tell    she had set out from mrs  goddard s
half an hour ago  she had been afraid it would rain  she had been
afraid it would pour down every moment  but she thought she might
get to hartfield first  she had hurried on as fast as possible 
but then  as she was passing by the house where a young woman
was making up a gown for her  she thought she would just step
in and see how it went on  and though she did not seem to stay
half a moment there  soon after she came out it began to rain 
and she did not know what to do  so she ran on directly  as fast
as she could  and took shelter at ford s    ford s was the principal
woollen draper  linen draper  and haberdasher s shop united 
the shop first in size and fashion in the place    and so 
there she had set  without an idea of any thing in the world 
full ten minutes  perhaps  when  all of a sudden  who should come in  
to be sure it was so very odd   but they always dealt at ford s  
who should come in  but elizabeth martin and her brother   
dear miss woodhouse  only think   i thought i should have fainted 
i did not know what to do   i was sitting near the door  elizabeth saw
me directly  but he did not  he was busy with the umbrella 
i am sure she saw me  but she looked away directly  and took
no notice  and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop 
and i kept sitting near the door   oh  dear  i was so miserable 
i am sure i must have been as white as my gown   i could not go away
you know  because of the rain  but i did so wish myself anywhere
in the world but there   oh  dear  miss woodhouse  well  at last 
i fancy  he looked round and saw me  for instead of going
on with her buyings  they began whispering to one another 
i am sure they were talking of me  and i could not help thinking
that he was persuading her to speak to me   do you think he was 
miss woodhouse    for presently she came forward  came quite up
to me  and asked me how i did  and seemed ready to shake hands 
if i would   she did not do any of it in the same way that she used 
i could see she was altered  but  however  she seemed to  try  to be
very friendly  and we shook hands  and stood talking some time 
but i know no more what i said  i was in such a tremble   i remember
she said she was sorry we never met now  which i thought almost
too kind   dear  miss woodhouse  i was absolutely miserable 
by that time  it was beginning to hold up  and i was determined
that nothing should stop me from getting away  and then  only think   
i found he was coming up towards me too  slowly you know  and as
if he did not quite know what to do  and so he came and spoke 
and i answered  and i stood for a minute  feeling dreadfully 
you know  one can t tell how  and then i took courage  and said it
did not rain  and i must go  and so off i set  and i had not got
three yards from the door  when he came after me  only to say 
if i was going to hartfield  he thought i had much better go round
by mr  cole s stables  for i should find the near way quite floated
by this rain   oh  dear  i thought it would have been the death of me 
so i said  i was very much obliged to him   you know i could
not do less  and then he went back to elizabeth  and i came round
by the stables  i believe i did  but i hardly knew where i was 
or any thing about it   oh   miss woodhouse  i would rather done
any thing than have it happen   and yet  you know  there was a sort
of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly 
and elizabeth  too   oh   miss woodhouse  do talk to me and make
me comfortable again  

very sincerely did emma wish to do so  but it was not immediately in
her power   she was obliged to stop and think   she was not thoroughly
comfortable herself   the young man s conduct  and his sister s 
seemed the result of real feeling  and she could not but pity them 
as harriet described it  there had been an interesting mixture
of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour 
but she had believed them to be well meaning  worthy people before 
and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion 
it was folly to be disturbed by it   of course  he must be sorry
to lose her  they must be all sorry   ambition  as well as love 
had probably been mortified   they might all have hoped to rise
by harriet s acquaintance   and besides  what was the value of
harriet s description   so easily pleased  so little discerning   
what signified her praise 

she exerted herself  and did try to make her comfortable 
by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle  and quite
unworthy of being dwelt on 

 it might be distressing  for the moment   said she   but you seem
to have behaved extremely well  and it is over  and may never  
can never  as a first meeting  occur again  and therefore you need
not think about it  

harriet said   very true   and she  would not think about it  
but still she talked of it  still she could talk of nothing else 
and emma  at last  in order to put the martins out of her head 
was obliged to hurry on the news  which she had meant to give
with so much tender caution  hardly knowing herself whether
to rejoice or be angry  ashamed or only amused  at such a state
of mind in poor harriet  such a conclusion of mr  elton s importance
with her 

mr  elton s rights  however  gradually revived   though she did not
feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before 
or an hour before  its interest soon increased  and before their
first conversation was over  she had talked herself into all the
sensations of curiosity  wonder and regret  pain and pleasure 
as to this fortunate miss hawkins  which could conduce to place
the martins under proper subordination in her fancy 

emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting 
it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock  without retaining
any influence to alarm   as harriet now lived  the martins could
not get at her  without seeking her  where hitherto they had wanted
either the courage or the condescension to seek her  for since her
refusal of the brother  the sisters never had been at mrs  goddard s 
and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again 
with any necessity  or even any power of speech 



chapter iv


human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in
interesting situations  that a young person  who either marries
or dies  is sure of being kindly spoken of 

a week had not passed since miss hawkins s name was first
mentioned in highbury  before she was  by some means or other 
discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind 
to be handsome  elegant  highly accomplished  and perfectly amiable 
and when mr  elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects 
and circulate the fame of her merits  there was very little more
for him to do  than to tell her christian name  and say whose
music she principally played 

mr  elton returned  a very happy man   he had gone away rejected
and mortified  disappointed in a very sanguine hope  after a series
of what appeared to him strong encouragement  and not only losing
the right lady  but finding himself debased to the level of a very
wrong one   he had gone away deeply offended  he came back engaged
to another  and to another as superior  of course  to the first 
as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost 
he came back gay and self satisfied  eager and busy  caring nothing
for miss woodhouse  and defying miss smith 

the charming augusta hawkins  in addition to all the usual advantages
of perfect beauty and merit  was in possession of an independent fortune 
of so many thousands as would always be called ten  a point of
some dignity  as well as some convenience   the story told well 
he had not thrown himself away  he had gained a woman of 10 000 l 
or thereabouts  and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity  
the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by
distinguishing notice  the history which he had to give mrs  cole
of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious  the steps
so quick  from the accidental rencontre  to the dinner at mr  green s 
and the party at mrs  brown s  smiles and blushes rising in importance  
with consciousness and agitation richly scattered  the lady
had been so easily impressed  so sweetly disposed  had in short 
to use a most intelligible phrase  been so very ready to have him 
that vanity and prudence were equally contented 

he had caught both substance and shadow  both fortune and affection 
and was just the happy man he ought to be  talking only of himself
and his own concerns  expecting to be congratulated  ready to be
laughed at  and  with cordial  fearless smiles  now addressing
all the young ladies of the place  to whom  a few weeks ago 
he would have been more cautiously gallant 

the wedding was no distant event  as the parties had only themselves
to please  and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for 
and when he set out for bath again  there was a general expectation 
which a certain glance of mrs  cole s did not seem to contradict 
that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride 

during his present short stay  emma had barely seen him  but just
enough to feel that the first meeting was over  and to give her
the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique
and pretension  now spread over his air   she was  in fact 
beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing
at all  and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very
disagreeable feelings  that  except in a moral light  as a penance 
a lesson  a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind 
she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again 
she wished him very well  but he gave her pain  and his welfare
twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction 

the pain of his continued residence in highbury  however  must certainly
be lessened by his marriage   many vain solicitudes would be prevented  
many awkwardnesses smoothed by it   a  mrs    elton  would be an excuse for
any change of intercourse  former intimacy might sink without remark 
it would be almost beginning their life of civility again 

of the lady  individually  emma thought very little   she was good
enough for mr  elton  no doubt  accomplished enough for highbury  
handsome enough  to look plain  probably  by harriet s side 
as to connexion  there emma was perfectly easy  persuaded 
that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet 
he had done nothing   on that article  truth seemed attainable 
 what  she was  must be uncertain  but  who  she was  might be found out 
and setting aside the 10 000 l   it did not appear that she was at
all harriet s superior   she brought no name  no blood  no alliance 
miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol  
merchant  of course  he must be called  but  as the whole of the
profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate  it was
not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very
moderate also   part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath 
but bristol was her home  the very heart of bristol  for though
the father and mother had died some years ago  an uncle remained  
in the law line  nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded
of him  than that he was in the law line  and with him the daughter
had lived   emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney 
and too stupid to rise   and all the grandeur of the connexion
seemed dependent on the elder sister  who was  very   well   married  
to a gentleman in a  great   way   near bristol  who kept two carriages 
that was the wind up of the history  that was the glory of
miss hawkins 

could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all 
she had talked her into love  but  alas  she was not so easily to be
talked out of it   the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies
of harriet s mind was not to be talked away   he might be superseded
by another  he certainly would indeed  nothing could be clearer 
even a robert martin would have been sufficient  but nothing else 
she feared  would cure her   harriet was one of those  who 
having once begun  would be always in love   and now  poor girl 
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr  elton 
she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other   emma saw
him only once  but two or three times every day harriet was sure
 just  to meet with him  or  just  to miss him   just  to hear his voice 
or see his shoulder   just  to have something occur to preserve him
in her fancy  in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture 
she was  moreover  perpetually hearing about him  for  excepting when
at hartfield  she was always among those who saw no fault in mr  elton 
and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns 
and every report  therefore  every guess  all that had already
occurred  all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs 
comprehending income  servants  and furniture  was continually
in agitation around her   her regard was receiving strength by
invariable praise of him  and her regrets kept alive  and feelings
irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins s happiness 
and continual observation of  how much he seemed attached   
his air as he walked by the house  the very sitting of his hat 
being all in proof of how much he was in love 

had it been allowable entertainment  had there been no pain
to her friend  or reproach to herself  in the waverings of
harriet s mind  emma would have been amused by its variations 
sometimes mr  elton predominated  sometimes the martins  and each
was occasionally useful as a check to the other   mr  elton s
engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr  martin 
the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been
a little put aside by elizabeth martin s calling at mrs  goddard s
a few days afterwards   harriet had not been at home  but a note had
been prepared and left for her  written in the very style to touch 
a small mixture of reproach  with a great deal of kindness 
and till mr  elton himself appeared  she had been much occupied
by it  continually pondering over what could be done in return 
and wishing to do more than she dared to confess   but mr  elton 
in person  had driven away all such cares   while he staid 
the martins were forgotten  and on the very morning of his setting off
for bath again  emma  to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned 
judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin s visit 

how that visit was to be acknowledged  what would be necessary  
and what might be safest  had been a point of some doubtful
consideration   absolute neglect of the mother and sisters 
when invited to come  would be ingratitude   it must not be 
and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance   

after much thinking  she could determine on nothing better  than harriet s
returning the visit  but in a way that  if they had understanding 
should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance 
she meant to take her in the carriage  leave her at the abbey mill 
while she drove a little farther  and call for her again so soon 
as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous
recurrences to the past  and give the most decided proof of what
degree of intimacy was chosen for the future 

she could think of nothing better   and though there was something
in it which her own heart could not approve  something of ingratitude 
merely glossed over  it must be done  or what would become of harriet 



chapter v


small heart had harriet for visiting   only half an hour before her
friend called for her at mrs  goddard s  her evil stars had led
her to the very spot where  at that moment  a trunk  directed to
 the   rev    philip   elton    white hart    bath   was to be seen under the
operation of being lifted into the butcher s cart  which was to
convey it to where the coaches past  and every thing in this world 
excepting that trunk and the direction  was consequently a blank 

she went  however  and when they reached the farm  and she was to
be put down  at the end of the broad  neat gravel walk  which led
between espalier apple trees to the front door  the sight of every
thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before 
was beginning to revive a little local agitation  and when they parted 
emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity 
which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed
quarter of an hour   she went on herself  to give that portion
of time to an old servant who was married  and settled in donwell 

the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again 
and miss smith receiving her summons  was with her without delay 
and unattended by any alarming young man   she came solitarily
down the gravel walk  a miss martin just appearing at the door 
and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility 

harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account 
she was feeling too much  but at last emma collected from her
enough to understand the sort of meeting  and the sort of pain it
was creating   she had seen only mrs  martin and the two girls 
they had received her doubtingly  if not coolly  and nothing
beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time  
till just at last  when mrs  martin s saying  all of a sudden 
that she thought miss smith was grown  had brought on a more
interesting subject  and a warmer manner   in that very room
she had been measured last september  with her two friends 
there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by
the window    he  had done it   they all seemed to remember the day 
the hour  the party  the occasion  to feel the same consciousness 
the same regrets  to be ready to return to the same good understanding 
and they were just growing again like themselves   harriet  as emma
must suspect  as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy  
when the carriage reappeared  and all was over   the style of
the visit  and the shortness of it  were then felt to be decisive 
fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully
passed six weeks not six months ago   emma could not but picture
it all  and feel how justly they might resent  how naturally
harriet must suffer   it was a bad business   she would have given
a great deal  or endured a great deal  to have had the martins
in a higher rank of life   they were so deserving  that a  little 
higher should have been enough   but as it was  how could she have
done otherwise   impossible   she could not repent   they must
be separated  but there was a great deal of pain in the process  
so much to herself at this time  that she soon felt the necessity
of a little consolation  and resolved on going home by way of randalls
to procure it   her mind was quite sick of mr  elton and the martins 
the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary 

it was a good scheme  but on driving to the door they heard
that neither  master nor mistress was at home   they had both
been out some time  the man believed they were gone to hartfield 

 this is too bad   cried emma  as they turned away    and now we
shall just miss them  too provoking   i do not know when i have been
so disappointed    and she leaned back in the corner  to indulge
her murmurs  or to reason them away  probably a little of both  
such being the commonest process of a not ill disposed mind 
presently the carriage stopt  she looked up  it was stopt
by mr  and mrs  weston  who were standing to speak to her 
there was instant pleasure in the sight of them  and still greater
pleasure was conveyed in sound  for mr  weston immediately accosted
her with 

 how d ye do   how d ye do   we have been sitting with your father  
glad to see him so well   frank comes to morrow  i had a letter
this morning  we see him to morrow by dinner time to a certainty  
he is at oxford to day  and he comes for a whole fortnight  i knew it would
be so   if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days 
i was always glad he did not come at christmas  now we are going
to have just the right weather for him  fine  dry  settled weather 
we shall enjoy him completely  every thing has turned out exactly
as we could wish  

there was no resisting such news  no possibility of avoiding the
influence of such a happy face as mr  weston s  confirmed as it all
was by the words and the countenance of his wife  fewer and quieter 
but not less to the purpose   to know that  she  thought his coming
certain was enough to make emma consider it so  and sincerely did
she rejoice in their joy   it was a most delightful reanimation
of exhausted spirits   the worn out past was sunk in the freshness
of what was coming  and in the rapidity of half a moment s thought 
she hoped mr  elton would now be talked of no more 

mr  weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe 
which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at
his command  as well as the route and the method of his journey 
and she listened  and smiled  and congratulated 

 i shall soon bring him over to hartfield   said he  at the conclusion 

emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech 
from his wife 

 we had better move on  mr  weston   said she   we are detaining
the girls  

 well  well  i am ready    and turning again to emma   but you must
not be expecting such a  very  fine young man  you have only had  my 
account you know  i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary    
though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very
different conviction 

emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent  and answer
in a manner that appropriated nothing 

 think of me to morrow  my dear emma  about four o clock  
was mrs  weston s parting injunction  spoken with some anxiety 
and meant only for her 

 four o clock   depend upon it he will be here by three   was mr  weston s
quick amendment  and so ended a most satisfactory meeting 
emma s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness  every thing wore
a different air  james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish
as before   when she looked at the hedges  she thought the elder at
least must soon be coming out  and when she turned round to harriet 
she saw something like a look of spring  a tender smile even there 

 will mr  frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford    
was a question  however  which did not augur much 

but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once 
and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come
in time 

the morning of the interesting day arrived  and mrs  weston s
faithful pupil did not forget either at ten  or eleven  or twelve
o clock  that she was to think of her at four 

 my dear  dear anxious friend    said she  in mental soliloquy 
while walking downstairs from her own room   always overcareful
for every body s comfort but your own  i see you now in all your
little fidgets  going again and again into his room  to be sure
that all is right    the clock struck twelve as she passed through
the hall     tis twelve  i shall not forget to think of you four
hours hence  and by this time to morrow  perhaps  or a little later 
i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here 
i am sure they will bring him soon  

she opened the parlour door  and saw two gentlemen sitting with
her father  mr  weston and his son   they had been arrived only
a few minutes  and mr  weston had scarcely finished his explanation
of frank s being a day before his time  and her father was yet
in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations  when
she appeared  to have her share of surprize  introduction  and pleasure 

the frank churchill so long talked of  so high in interest 
was actually before her  he was presented to her  and she did
not think too much had been said in his praise  he was a  very  good
looking young man  height  air  address  all were unexceptionable 
and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness
of his father s  he looked quick and sensible   she felt immediately
that she should like him  and there was a well bred ease of manner 
and a readiness to talk  which convinced her that he came intending
to be acquainted with her  and that acquainted they soon must be 

he had reached randalls the evening before   she was pleased
with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan 
and travel earlier  later  and quicker  that he might gain half
a day 

 i told you yesterday   cried mr  weston with exultation   i told
you all that he would be here before the time named   i remembered
what i used to do myself   one cannot creep upon a journey 
one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned  and the
pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins 
is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs  

 it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it   said the young man 
 though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far 
but in coming  home  i felt i might do any thing  

the word  home  made his father look on him with fresh complacency 
emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable 
the conviction was strengthened by what followed   he was very much
pleased with randalls  thought it a most admirably arranged house 
would hardly allow it even to be very small  admired the situation 
the walk to highbury  highbury itself  hartfield still more 
and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest
in the country which none but one s  own  country gives  and the
greatest curiosity to visit it   that he should never have been
able to indulge so amiable a feeling before  passed suspiciously
through emma s brain  but still  if it were a falsehood  it was a
pleasant one  and pleasantly handled   his manner had no air of study
or exaggeration   he did really look and speak as if in a state of no
common enjoyment 

their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance 
on his side were the inquiries    was she a horsewoman   pleasant rides   
pleasant walks   had they a large neighbourhood   highbury  perhaps 
afforded society enough   there were several very pretty houses
in and about it   balls  had they balls   was it a musical society  

but when satisfied on all these points  and their acquaintance
proportionably advanced  he contrived to find an opportunity 
while their two fathers were engaged with each other  of introducing
his mother in law  and speaking of her with so much handsome praise 
so much warm admiration  so much gratitude for the happiness she
secured to his father  and her very kind reception of himself 
as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please  
and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her 
he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be
thoroughly deserved by mrs  weston  but  undoubtedly he could know
very little of the matter   he understood what would be welcome 
he could be sure of little else    his father s marriage   he said 
 had been the wisest measure  every friend must rejoice in it 
and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must
be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation
on him  

he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor s merits 
without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it
was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse s
character  than miss woodhouse miss taylor s  and at last  as if resolved
to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object  he
wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person 

 elegant  agreeable manners  i was prepared for   said he 
 but i confess that  considering every thing  i had not expected
more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age 
i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs  weston  

 you cannot see too much perfection in mrs  weston for my feelings  
said emma   were you to guess her to be  eighteen   i should listen
with pleasure  but  she  would be ready to quarrel with you for using
such words   don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as
a pretty young woman  

 i hope i should know better   he replied   no  depend upon it 
 with a gallant bow   that in addressing mrs  weston i should
understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought
extravagant in my terms  

emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected
from their knowing each other  which had taken strong possession
of her mind  had ever crossed his  and whether his compliments were
to be considered as marks of acquiescence  or proofs of defiance 
she must see more of him to understand his ways  at present she
only felt they were agreeable 

she had no doubt of what mr  weston was often thinking about 
his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them
with a happy expression  and even  when he might have determined not
to look  she was confident that he was often listening 

her own father s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind 
the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration
or suspicion  was a most comfortable circumstance   happily he
was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it   
though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged 
he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any 
it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons 
understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were
proved against them   she blessed the favouring blindness 
he could now  without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise 
without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest 
give way to all his natural kind hearted civility in solicitous
inquiries after mr  frank churchill s accommodation on his journey 
through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road  and express
very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped
catching cold  which  however  he could not allow him to feel quite
assured of himself till after another night 

a reasonable visit paid  mr  weston began to move    he must be going 
he had business at the crown about his hay  and a great many errands
for mrs  weston at ford s  but he need not hurry any body else  
his son  too well bred to hear the hint  rose immediately also 
saying 

 as you are going farther on business  sir  i will take the
opportunity of paying a visit  which must be paid some day or other 
and therefore may as well be paid now   i have the honour of being
acquainted with a neighbour of yours   turning to emma   a lady
residing in or near highbury  a family of the name of fairfax 
i shall have no difficulty  i suppose  in finding the house 
though fairfax  i believe  is not the proper name  i should rather
say barnes  or bates   do you know any family of that name  

 to be sure we do   cried his father   mrs  bates  we passed her house  
i saw miss bates at the window   true  true  you are acquainted
with miss fairfax  i remember you knew her at weymouth  and a fine
girl she is   call upon her  by all means  

 there is no necessity for my calling this morning   said the
young man   another day would do as well  but there was that degree
of acquaintance at weymouth which   

 oh  go to day  go to day  do not defer it   what is right to be done
cannot be done too soon   and  besides  i must give you a hint  frank 
any want of attention to her  here  should be carefully avoided 
you saw her with the campbells  when she was the equal of every body
she mixed with  but here she is with a poor old grandmother 
who has barely enough to live on   if you do not call early it
will be a slight  

the son looked convinced 

 i have heard her speak of the acquaintance   said emma   she is
a very elegant young woman  

he agreed to it  but with so quiet a  yes   as inclined her almost
to doubt his real concurrence  and yet there must be a very distinct
sort of elegance for the fashionable world  if jane fairfax could
be thought only ordinarily gifted with it 

 if you were never particularly struck by her manners before  
said she   i think you will to day  you will see her to advantage 
see her and hear her  no  i am afraid you will not hear her at all 
for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue  

 you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax  sir  are you  
said mr  woodhouse  always the last to make his way in conversation 
 then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very
agreeable young lady   she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama
and aunt  very worthy people  i have known them all my life 
they will be extremely glad to see you  i am sure  and one of my
servants shall go with you to shew you the way  

 my dear sir  upon no account in the world  my father can direct me  

 but your father is not going so far  he is only going to the crown 
quite on the other side of the street  and there are a great many houses 
you might be very much at a loss  and it is a very dirty walk 
unless you keep on the footpath  but my coachman can tell you
where you had best cross the street  

mr  frank churchill still declined it  looking as serious as he could 
and his father gave his hearty support by calling out   my good friend 
this is quite unnecessary  frank knows a puddle of water when he
sees it  and as to mrs  bates s  he may get there from the crown
in a hop  step  and jump  

they were permitted to go alone  and with a cordial nod from one 
and a graceful bow from the other  the two gentlemen took leave 
emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance 
and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of
the day  with full confidence in their comfort 



chapter vi


the next morning brought mr  frank churchill again   he came with
mrs  weston  to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially 
he had been sitting with her  it appeared  most companionably at home 
till her usual hour of exercise  and on being desired to chuse
their walk  immediately fixed on highbury    he did not doubt there
being very pleasant walks in every direction  but if left to him 
he should always chuse the same   highbury  that airy  cheerful 
happy looking highbury  would be his constant attraction    
highbury  with mrs  weston  stood for hartfield  and she trusted to
its bearing the same construction with him   they walked thither directly 

emma had hardly expected them   for mr  weston  who had called in
for half a minute  in order to hear that his son was very handsome 
knew nothing of their plans  and it was an agreeable surprize
to her  therefore  to perceive them walking up to the house together 
arm in arm   she was wanting to see him again  and especially
to see him in company with mrs  weston  upon his behaviour to whom
her opinion of him was to depend   if he were deficient there 
nothing should make amends for it   but on seeing them together 
she became perfectly satisfied   it was not merely in fine words
or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty  nothing could be
more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her  nothing could
more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and
securing her affection   and there was time enough for emma to form a
reasonable judgment  as their visit included all the rest of the morning 
they were all three walking about together for an hour or two  
first round the shrubberies of hartfield  and afterwards in highbury 
he was delighted with every thing  admired hartfield sufficiently
for mr  woodhouse s ear  and when their going farther was resolved on 
confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village 
and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma
could have supposed 

some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings 
he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long 
and which had been the home of his father s father  and on recollecting
that an old woman who had nursed him was still living  walked in quest
of her cottage from one end of the street to the other  and though
in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit 
they shewed  altogether  a good will towards highbury in general 
which must be very like a merit to those he was with 

emma watched and decided  that with such feelings as were now shewn 
it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily
absenting himself  that he had not been acting a part  or making
a parade of insincere professions  and that mr  knightley certainly
had not done him justice 

their first pause was at the crown inn  an inconsiderable house 
though the principal one of the sort  where a couple of pair of
post horses were kept  more for the convenience of the neighbourhood
than from any run on the road  and his companions had not expected
to be detained by any interest excited there  but in passing it they
gave the history of the large room visibly added  it had been built
many years ago for a ball room  and while the neighbourhood had been
in a particularly populous  dancing state  had been occasionally used
as such   but such brilliant days had long passed away  and now the
highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist
club established among the gentlemen and half gentlemen of the place 
he was immediately interested   its character as a ball room caught him 
and instead of passing on  he stopt for several minutes at the two
superior sashed windows which were open  to look in and contemplate
its capabilities  and lament that its original purpose should
have ceased   he saw no fault in the room  he would acknowledge
none which they suggested   no  it was long enough  broad enough 
handsome enough   it would hold the very number for comfort 
they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through
the winter   why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good
old days of the room   she who could do any thing in highbury 
the want of proper families in the place  and the conviction
that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be
tempted to attend  were mentioned  but he was not satisfied 
he could not be persuaded that so many good looking houses as he saw
around him  could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting 
and even when particulars were given and families described  he was
still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture
would be any thing  or that there would be the smallest difficulty
in every body s returning into their proper place the next morning 
he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing  and emma
was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail
so decidedly against the habits of the churchills   he seemed to have
all the life and spirit  cheerful feelings  and social inclinations
of his father  and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe 
of pride  indeed  there was  perhaps  scarcely enough  his indifference
to a confusion of rank  bordered too much on inelegance of mind 
he could be no judge  however  of the evil he was holding cheap 
it was but an effusion of lively spirits 

at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown 
and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged 
emma recollected his intended visit the day before  and asked him
if he had paid it 

 yes  oh  yes   he replied   i was just going to mention it 
a very successful visit   i saw all the three ladies  and felt very
much obliged to you for your preparatory hint   if the talking aunt
had taken me quite by surprize  it must have been the death of me 
as it was  i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit 
ten minutes would have been all that was necessary  perhaps all that
was proper  and i had told my father i should certainly be at home
before him  but there was no getting away  no pause  and  to my
utter astonishment  i found  when he  finding me nowhere else 
joined me there at last  that i had been actually sitting with them
very nearly three quarters of an hour   the good lady had not given me
the possibility of escape before  

 and how did you think miss fairfax looking  

 ill  very ill  that is  if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill 
but the expression is hardly admissible  mrs  weston  is it 
ladies can never look ill   and  seriously  miss fairfax is naturally
so pale  as almost always to give the appearance of ill health   
a most deplorable want of complexion  

emma would not agree to this  and began a warm defence of miss
fairfax s complexion    it was certainly never brilliant  but she
would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general  and there was
a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance
to the character of her face    he listened with all due deference 
acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same  but yet he
must confess  that to him nothing could make amends for the want
of the fine glow of health   where features were indifferent 
a fine complexion gave beauty to them all  and where they were good 
the effect was  fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the
effect was 

 well   said emma   there is no disputing about taste   at least
you admire her except her complexion  

he shook his head and laughed    i cannot separate miss fairfax
and her complexion  

 did you see her often at weymouth   were you often in the same society  

at this moment they were approaching ford s  and he hastily exclaimed 
 ha  this must be the very shop that every body attends every day
of their lives  as my father informs me   he comes to highbury himself 
he says  six days out of the seven  and has always business at ford s 
if it be not inconvenient to you  pray let us go in  that i may prove
myself to belong to the place  to be a true citizen of highbury 
i must buy something at ford s  it will be taking out my freedom   
i dare say they sell gloves  

 oh  yes  gloves and every thing   i do admire your patriotism 
you will be adored in highbury   you were very popular before you came 
because you were mr  weston s son  but lay out half a guinea at
ford s  and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues  

they went in  and while the sleek  well tied parcels of  men s beavers 
and  york tan  were bringing down and displaying on the counter 
he said   but i beg your pardon  miss woodhouse  you were speaking
to me  you were saying something at the very moment of this burst
of my  amor   patriae    do not let me lose it   i assure you the utmost
stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any
happiness in private life  

 i merely asked  whether you had known much of miss fairfax
and her party at weymouth  

 and now that i understand your question  i must pronounce it to be a
very unfair one   it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree
of acquaintance   miss fairfax must already have given her account   
i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow  

 upon my word  you answer as discreetly as she could do herself 
but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed 
she is so very reserved  so very unwilling to give the least
information about any body  that i really think you may say what you
like of your acquaintance with her  

 may i  indeed   then i will speak the truth  and nothing suits me
so well   i met her frequently at weymouth   i had known the campbells
a little in town  and at weymouth we were very much in the same set 
colonel campbell is a very agreeable man  and mrs  campbell a friendly 
warm hearted woman   i like them all  

 you know miss fairfax s situation in life  i conclude  what she
is destined to be  

 yes   rather hesitatingly   i believe i do  

 you get upon delicate subjects  emma   said mrs  weston smiling 
 remember that i am here   mr  frank churchill hardly knows
what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life 
i will move a little farther off  

 i certainly do forget to think of  her    said emma   as having ever
been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend  

he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment 

when the gloves were bought  and they had quitted the shop again 
 did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of  play  
said frank churchill 

 ever hear her   repeated emma    you forget how much she belongs
to highbury   i have heard her every year of our lives since we
both began   she plays charmingly  

 you think so  do you   i wanted the opinion of some one who
could really judge   she appeared to me to play well  that is 
with considerable taste  but i know nothing of the matter myself   
i am excessively fond of music  but without the smallest skill
or right of judging of any body s performance   i have been used
to hear her s admired  and i remember one proof of her being
thought to play well   a man  a very musical man  and in love
with another woman  engaged to her  on the point of marriage  
would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument 
if the lady in question could sit down instead  never seemed
to like to hear one if he could hear the other   that  i thought 
in a man of known musical talent  was some proof  

 proof indeed   said emma  highly amused    mr  dixon is very musical 
is he   we shall know more about them all  in half an hour  from you 
than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year  

 yes  mr  dixon and miss campbell were the persons  and i thought
it a very strong proof  

 certainly  very strong it was  to own the truth  a great deal
stronger than  if  i  had been miss campbell  would have been at all
agreeable to me   i could not excuse a man s having more music
than love  more ear than eye  a more acute sensibility to fine
sounds than to my feelings   how did miss campbell appear to like it  

 it was her very particular friend  you know  

 poor comfort   said emma  laughing    one would rather have a stranger
preferred than one s very particular friend  with a stranger it might
not recur again  but the misery of having a very particular friend
always at hand  to do every thing better than one does oneself   
poor mrs  dixon   well  i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland  

 you are right   it was not very flattering to miss campbell 
but she really did not seem to feel it  

 so much the better  or so much the worse   i do not know which 
but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her  quickness of friendship 
or dulness of feeling  there was one person  i think  who must have
felt it   miss fairfax herself   she must have felt the improper
and dangerous distinction  

 as to that  i do not   

 oh  do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax s
sensations from you  or from any body else   they are known to no
human being  i guess  but herself   but if she continued to play
whenever she was asked by mr  dixon  one may guess what one chuses  

 there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all   
he began rather quickly  but checking himself  added   however  it
is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were  
how it might all be behind the scenes   i can only say that there
was smoothness outwardly   but you  who have known miss fairfax from
a child  must be a better judge of her character  and of how she
is likely to conduct herself in critical situations  than i can be  

 i have known her from a child  undoubtedly  we have been children
and women together  and it is natural to suppose that we should
be intimate   that we should have taken to each other whenever
she visited her friends   but we never did   i hardly know how it
has happened  a little  perhaps  from that wickedness on my side
which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized
and so cried up as she always was  by her aunt and grandmother 
and all their set   and then  her reserve  i never could attach
myself to any one so completely reserved  

 it is a most repulsive quality  indeed   said he    oftentimes
very convenient  no doubt  but never pleasing   there is safety
in reserve  but no attraction   one cannot love a reserved person  

 not till the reserve ceases towards oneself  and then the attraction
may be the greater   but i must be more in want of a friend 
or an agreeable companion  than i have yet been  to take
the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one 
intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question 
i have no reason to think ill of her  not the least  except that
such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner 
such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body  is apt
to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal  

he perfectly agreed with her   and after walking together so long 
and thinking so much alike  emma felt herself so well acquainted with him 
that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting 
he was not exactly what she had expected  less of the man of the
world in some of his notions  less of the spoiled child of fortune 
therefore better than she had expected   his ideas seemed more moderate  
his feelings warmer   she was particularly struck by his manner
of considering mr  elton s house  which  as well as the church 
he would go and look at  and would not join them in finding much
fault with   no  he could not believe it a bad house  not such a house
as a man was to be pitied for having   if it were to be shared with
the woman he loved  he could not think any man to be pitied for having
that house   there must be ample room in it for every real comfort 
the man must be a blockhead who wanted more 

mrs  weston laughed  and said he did not know what he was talking about 
used only to a large house himself  and without ever thinking how many
advantages and accommodations were attached to its size  he could
be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one 
but emma  in her own mind  determined that he  did  know what he
was talking about  and that he shewed a very amiable inclination
to settle early in life  and to marry  from worthy motives 
he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be
occasioned by no housekeeper s room  or a bad butler s pantry 
but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make
him happy  and that whenever he were attached  he would willingly
give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment 



chapter vii


emma s very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken
the following day  by hearing that he was gone off to london 
merely to have his hair cut   a sudden freak seemed to have seized him
at breakfast  and he had sent for a chaise and set off  intending to
return to dinner  but with no more important view that appeared than
having his hair cut   there was certainly no harm in his travelling
sixteen miles twice over on such an errand  but there was an air
of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve   it did
not accord with the rationality of plan  the moderation in expense 
or even the unselfish warmth of heart  which she had believed herself
to discern in him yesterday   vanity  extravagance  love of change 
restlessness of temper  which must be doing something  good or bad 
heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs  weston 
indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general  he became
liable to all these charges   his father only called him a coxcomb 
and thought it a very good story  but that mrs  weston did not like it 
was clear enough  by her passing it over as quickly as possible 
and making no other comment than that  all young people would have
their little whims  

with the exception of this little blot  emma found that his visit
hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him   mrs  weston
was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he
made himself  how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether 
he appeared to have a very open temper  certainly a very cheerful
and lively one  she could observe nothing wrong in his notions 
a great deal decidedly right  he spoke of his uncle with warm regard 
was fond of talking of him  said he would be the best man in the
world if he were left to himself  and though there was no being
attached to the aunt  he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude 
and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect 
this was all very promising  and  but for such an unfortunate fancy
for having his hair cut  there was nothing to denote him unworthy
of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him 
the honour  if not of being really in love with her  of being
at least very near it  and saved only by her own indifference  
 for still her resolution held of never marrying   the honour  in short 
of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance 

mr  weston  on his side  added a virtue to the account which must
have some weight   he gave her to understand that frank admired
her extremely  thought her very beautiful and very charming 
and with so much to be said for him altogether  she found she must
not judge him harshly   as mrs  weston observed   all young people
would have their little whims  

there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry  not so
leniently disposed   in general he was judged  throughout the parishes
of donwell and highbury  with great candour  liberal allowances
were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man  
one who smiled so often and bowed so well  but there was one spirit
among them not to be softened  from its power of censure  by bows
or smiles  mr  knightley   the circumstance was told him at hartfield 
for the moment  he was silent  but emma heard him almost immediately
afterwards say to himself  over a newspaper he held in his hand 
 hum  just the trifling  silly fellow i took him for    she had
half a mind to resent  but an instant s observation convinced
her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings 
and not meant to provoke  and therefore she let it pass 

although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings 
mr  and mrs  weston s visit this morning was in another respect
particularly opportune   something occurred while they were
at hartfield  to make emma want their advice  and  which was
still more lucky  she wanted exactly the advice they gave 

this was the occurrence   the coles had been settled some years
in highbury  and were very good sort of people  friendly  liberal 
and unpretending  but  on the other hand  they were of low origin 
in trade  and only moderately genteel   on their first coming into
the country  they had lived in proportion to their income  quietly 
keeping little company  and that little unexpensively  but the last
year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means  
the house in town had yielded greater profits  and fortune in general
had smiled on them   with their wealth  their views increased 
their want of a larger house  their inclination for more company 
they added to their house  to their number of servants 
to their expenses of every sort  and by this time were  in fortune
and style of living  second only to the family at hartfield 
their love of society  and their new dining room  prepared every body
for their keeping dinner company  and a few parties  chiefly among
the single men  had already taken place   the regular and best
families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite  
neither donwell  nor hartfield  nor randalls   nothing should
tempt  her  to go  if they did  and she regretted that her father s
known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she
could wish   the coles were very respectable in their way  but they
ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms
on which the superior families would visit them   this lesson 
she very much feared  they would receive only from herself 
she had little hope of mr  knightley  none of mr  weston 

but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many
weeks before it appeared  that when the insult came at last 
it found her very differently affected   donwell and randalls
had received their invitation  and none had come for her father
and herself  and mrs  weston s accounting for it with  i suppose
they will not take the liberty with you  they know you do not
dine out   was not quite sufficient   she felt that she should
like to have had the power of refusal  and afterwards  as the idea
of the party to be assembled there  consisting precisely of those
whose society was dearest to her  occurred again and again 
she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept 
harriet was to be there in the evening  and the bateses   they had
been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before 
and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence 
might not the evening end in a dance  had been a question of his 
the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits 
and her being left in solitary grandeur  even supposing the omission
to be intended as a compliment  was but poor comfort 

it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were
at hartfield  which made their presence so acceptable  for though her
first remark  on reading it  was that  of course it must be declined  
she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do 
that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful 

she owned that  considering every thing  she was not absolutely
without inclination for the party   the coles expressed themselves
so properly  there was so much real attention in the manner of it  
so much consideration for her father    they would have solicited the
honour earlier  but had been waiting the arrival of a folding screen
from london  which they hoped might keep mr  woodhouse from any draught
of air  and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the
honour of his company    upon the whole  she was very persuadable 
and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be
done without neglecting his comfort  how certainly mrs  goddard 
if not mrs  bates  might be depended on for bearing him company  
mr  woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter s
going out to dinner on a day now near at hand  and spending
the whole evening away from him   as for  his  going  emma did
not wish him to think it possible  the hours would be too late 
and the party too numerous   he was soon pretty well resigned 

 i am not fond of dinner visiting   said he   i never was 
no more is emma   late hours do not agree with us   i am sorry
mr  and mrs  cole should have done it   i think it would be
much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer 
and take their tea with us  take us in their afternoon walk 
which they might do  as our hours are so reasonable  and yet get home
without being out in the damp of the evening   the dews of a summer
evening are what i would not expose any body to   however  as they
are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them  and as you
will both be there  and mr  knightley too  to take care of her 
i cannot wish to prevent it  provided the weather be what it ought 
neither damp  nor cold  nor windy    then turning to mrs  weston 
with a look of gentle reproach   ah   miss taylor  if you had
not married  you would have staid at home with me  

 well  sir   cried mr  weston   as i took miss taylor away 
it is incumbent on me to supply her place  if i can  and i will
step to mrs  goddard in a moment  if you wish it  

but the idea of any thing to be done in a  moment   was increasing 
not lessening  mr  woodhouse s agitation   the ladies knew better
how to allay it   mr  weston must be quiet  and every thing
deliberately arranged 

with this treatment  mr  woodhouse was soon composed enough
for talking as usual    he should be happy to see mrs  goddard 
he had a great regard for mrs  goddard  and emma should write a line 
and invite her   james could take the note   but first of all 
there must be an answer written to mrs  cole  

 you will make my excuses  my dear  as civilly as possible   you will
say that i am quite an invalid  and go no where  and therefore must
decline their obliging invitation  beginning with my  compliments  
of course   but you will do every thing right   i need not tell you
what is to be done   we must remember to let james know that the carriage
will be wanted on tuesday   i shall have no fears for you with him 
we have never been there above once since the new approach was made 
but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely 
and when you get there  you must tell him at what time you would
have him come for you again  and you had better name an early hour 
you will not like staying late   you will get very tired when tea
is over  

 but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired  papa  

 oh  no  my love  but you will soon be tired   there will be
a great many people talking at once   you will not like the noise  

 but  my dear sir   cried mr  weston   if emma comes away early 
it will be breaking up the party  

 and no great harm if it does   said mr  woodhouse    the sooner
every party breaks up  the better  

 but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles 
emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence 
they are good natured people  and think little of their own claims 
but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no
great compliment  and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought
of than any other person s in the room   you would not wish to disappoint
and mortify the coles  i am sure  sir  friendly  good sort of people
as ever lived  and who have been your neighbours these  ten  years  

 no  upon no account in the world  mr  weston  i am much obliged
to you for reminding me   i should be extremely sorry to be giving
them any pain   i know what worthy people they are   perry tells
me that mr  cole never touches malt liquor   you would not think
it to look at him  but he is bilious  mr  cole is very bilious 
no  i would not be the means of giving them any pain   my dear emma 
we must consider this   i am sure  rather than run the risk of hurting
mr  and mrs  cole  you would stay a little longer than you might wish 
you will not regard being tired   you will be perfectly safe 
you know  among your friends  

 oh yes  papa   i have no fears at all for myself  and i should have
no scruples of staying as late as mrs  weston  but on your account 
i am only afraid of your sitting up for me   i am not afraid
of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs  goddard 
she loves piquet  you know  but when she is gone home  i am afraid
you will be sitting up by yourself  instead of going to bed at your
usual time  and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort 
you must promise me not to sit up  

he did  on the condition of some promises on her side   such as that 
if she came home cold  she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly 
if hungry  that she would take something to eat  that her own maid
should sit up for her  and that serle and the butler should see
that every thing were safe in the house  as usual 



chapter viii


frank churchill came back again  and if he kept his father s
dinner waiting  it was not known at hartfield  for mrs  weston
was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr  woodhouse 
to betray any imperfection which could be concealed 

he came back  had had his hair cut  and laughed at himself with
a very good grace  but without seeming really at all ashamed
of what he had done   he had no reason to wish his hair longer 
to conceal any confusion of face  no reason to wish the money unspent 
to improve his spirits   he was quite as undaunted and as lively
as ever  and  after seeing him  emma thus moralised to herself   

 i do not know whether it ought to be so  but certainly silly things
do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an
impudent way   wickedness is always wickedness  but folly is not
always folly   it depends upon the character of those who handle it 
mr  knightley  he is  not  a trifling  silly young man   if he were 
he would have done this differently   he would either have gloried
in the achievement  or been ashamed of it   there would have been
either the ostentation of a coxcomb  or the evasions of a mind too
weak to defend its own vanities   no  i am perfectly sure that he
is not trifling or silly  

with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again 
and for a longer time than hitherto  of judging of his general manners 
and by inference  of the meaning of his manners towards herself 
of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness
into her air  and of fancying what the observations of all those
might be  who were now seeing them together for the first time 

she meant to be very happy  in spite of the scene being laid at
mr  cole s  and without being able to forget that among the failings
of mr  elton  even in the days of his favour  none had disturbed
her more than his propensity to dine with mr  cole 

her father s comfort was amply secured  mrs  bates as well as
mrs  goddard being able to come  and her last pleasing duty 
before she left the house  was to pay her respects to them as
they sat together after dinner  and while her father was fondly
noticing the beauty of her dress  to make the two ladies all
the amends in her power  by helping them to large slices of cake
and full glasses of wine  for whatever unwilling self denial his
care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise
during the meal   she had provided a plentiful dinner for them 
she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it 

she followed another carriage to mr  cole s door  and was pleased
to see that it was mr  knightley s  for mr  knightley keeping
no horses  having little spare money and a great deal of health 
activity  and independence  was too apt  in emma s opinion  to get
about as he could  and not use his carriage so often as became
the owner of donwell abbey   she had an opportunity now of speaking
her approbation while warm from her heart  for he stopped to hand her out 

 this is coming as you should do   said she   like a gentleman   
i am quite glad to see you  

he thanked her  observing   how lucky that we should arrive at the same
moment  for  if we had met first in the drawing room  i doubt whether
you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual   
you might not have distinguished how i came  by my look or manner  

 yes i should  i am sure i should   there is always a look of
consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know
to be beneath them   you think you carry it off very well  i dare say 
but with you it is a sort of bravado  an air of affected unconcern 
i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances 
 now  you have nothing to try for   you are not afraid of being
supposed ashamed   you are not striving to look taller than any
body else    now  i shall really be very happy to walk into the same
room with you  

 nonsensical girl   was his reply  but not at all in anger 

emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party
as with mr  knightley   she was received with a cordial respect
which could not but please  and given all the consequence she could
wish for   when the westons arrived  the kindest looks of love 
the strongest of admiration were for her  from both husband and wife 
the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked
her as his peculiar object  and at dinner she found him seated
by her  and  as she firmly believed  not without some dexterity
on his side 

the party was rather large  as it included one other family  a proper
unobjectionable country family  whom the coles had the advantage of
naming among their acquaintance  and the male part of mr  cox s family 
the lawyer of highbury   the less worthy females were to come
in the evening  with miss bates  miss fairfax  and miss smith 
but already  at dinner  they were too numerous for any subject
of conversation to be general  and  while politics and mr  elton
were talked over  emma could fairly surrender all her attention to
the pleasantness of her neighbour   the first remote sound to which
she felt herself obliged to attend  was the name of jane fairfax 
mrs  cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be
very interesting   she listened  and found it well worth listening to 
that very dear part of emma  her fancy  received an amusing supply 
mrs  cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates 
and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight
of a pianoforte  a very elegant looking instrument  not a grand 
but a large sized square pianoforte  and the substance of the story 
the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize  and inquiry 
and congratulations on her side  and explanations on miss bates s  was 
that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood s the day before 
to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece  entirely unexpected 
that at first  by miss bates s account  jane herself was quite at
a loss  quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it  
but now  they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only
one quarter   of course it must be from colonel campbell 

 one can suppose nothing else   added mrs  cole   and i was only
surprized that there could ever have been a doubt   but jane 
it seems  had a letter from them very lately  and not a word was said
about it   she knows their ways best  but i should not consider their
silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present 
they might chuse to surprize her  

mrs  cole had many to agree with her  every body who spoke on the
subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell 
and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made  and there
were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way 
and still listen to mrs  cole 

 i declare  i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given
me more satisfaction   it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax 
who plays so delightfully  should not have an instrument 
it seemed quite a shame  especially considering how many houses
there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away 
this is like giving ourselves a slap  to be sure  and it was
but yesterday i was telling mr  cole  i really was ashamed
to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room  while i
do not know one note from another  and our little girls  who are
but just beginning  perhaps may never make any thing of it 
and there is poor jane fairfax  who is mistress of music  has not
any thing of the nature of an instrument  not even the pitifullest
old spinet in the world  to amuse herself with   i was saying this
to mr  cole but yesterday  and he quite agreed with me  only he
is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging
himself in the purchase  hoping that some of our good neighbours might
be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can 
and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought  
or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it   we are in great
hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening  

miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence  and finding that nothing
more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs  cole s 
turned to frank churchill 

 why do you smile   said she 

 nay  why do you  

 me   i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell s being
so rich and so liberal   it is a handsome present  

 very  

 i rather wonder that it was never made before  

 perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before  

 or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument  
which must now be shut up in london  untouched by any body  

 that is a grand pianoforte  and he might think it too large
for mrs  bates s house  

 you may  say  what you chuse  but your countenance testifies
that your  thoughts  on this subject are very much like mine  

 i do not know   i rather believe you are giving me more credit for
acuteness than i deserve   i smile because you smile  and shall probably
suspect whatever i find you suspect  but at present i do not see what
there is to question   if colonel campbell is not the person  who can be  

 what do you say to mrs  dixon  

 mrs  dixon  very true indeed   i had not thought of mrs  dixon 
she must know as well as her father  how acceptable an instrument
would be  and perhaps the mode of it  the mystery  the surprize 
is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s  it
is mrs  dixon  i dare say   i told you that your suspicions would
guide mine  

 if so  you must extend your suspicions and comprehend  mr   dixon
in them  

 mr  dixon   very well   yes  i immediately perceive that it must
be the joint present of mr  and mrs  dixon   we were speaking the
other day  you know  of his being so warm an admirer of her performance  

 yes  and what you told me on that head  confirmed an idea which i
had entertained before   i do not mean to reflect upon the good
intentions of either mr  dixon or miss fairfax  but i cannot help
suspecting either that  after making his proposals to her friend 
he had the misfortune to fall in love with  her   or that he became
conscious of a little attachment on her side   one might guess
twenty things without guessing exactly the right  but i am sure
there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury
instead of going with the campbells to ireland   here  she must be
leading a life of privation and penance  there it would have been
all enjoyment   as to the pretence of trying her native air  i look
upon that as a mere excuse   in the summer it might have passed 
but what can any body s native air do for them in the months
of january  february  and march   good fires and carriages would
be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health  and i
dare say in her s  i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions 
though you make so noble a profession of doing it  but i honestly
tell you what they are  

 and  upon my word  they have an air of great probability 
mr  dixon s preference of her music to her friend s  i can answer
for being very decided  

 and then  he saved her life   did you ever hear of that   
a water party  and by some accident she was falling overboard 
he caught her  

 he did   i was there  one of the party  

 were you really   well   but you observed nothing of course 
for it seems to be a new idea to you   if i had been there  i think
i should have made some discoveries  

 i dare say you would  but i  simple i  saw nothing but the fact 
that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr  dixon
caught her   it was the work of a moment   and though the consequent
shock and alarm was very great and much more durable  indeed i
believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again  
yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar
anxiety to be observable   i do not mean to say  however  that you
might not have made discoveries  

the conversation was here interrupted   they were called on to share
in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses 
and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others  but when
the table was again safely covered  when every corner dish was placed
exactly right  and occupation and ease were generally restored 
emma said 

 the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me   i wanted to know
a little more  and this tells me quite enough   depend upon it 
we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr  and mrs  dixon  

 and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we
must conclude it to come from the campbells  

 no  i am sure it is not from the campbells   miss fairfax knows it
is not from the campbells  or they would have been guessed at first 
she would not have been puzzled  had she dared fix on them 
i may not have convinced you perhaps  but i am perfectly convinced
myself that mr  dixon is a principal in the business  

 indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced   your reasonings
carry my judgment along with them entirely   at first  while i
supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver  i saw
it only as paternal kindness  and thought it the most natural thing
in the world   but when you mentioned mrs  dixon  i felt how much more
probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship 
and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love  

there was no occasion to press the matter farther   the conviction
seemed real  he looked as if he felt it   she said no more 
other subjects took their turn  and the rest of the dinner passed away 
the dessert succeeded  the children came in  and were talked
to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation  a few clever
things said  a few downright silly  but by much the larger proportion
neither the one nor the other  nothing worse than everyday remarks 
dull repetitions  old news  and heavy jokes 

the ladies had not been long in the drawing room  before the other ladies 
in their different divisions  arrived   emma watched the entree of her
own particular little friend  and if she could not exult in her dignity
and grace  she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the
artless manner  but could most heartily rejoice in that light  cheerful 
unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations
of pleasure  in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection 
there she sat  and who would have guessed how many tears she had
been lately shedding   to be in company  nicely dressed herself
and seeing others nicely dressed  to sit and smile and look pretty 
and say nothing  was enough for the happiness of the present hour 
jane fairfax did look and move superior  but emma suspected she
might have been glad to change feelings with harriet  very glad
to have purchased the mortification of having loved  yes  of having
loved even mr  elton in vain  by the surrender of all the dangerous
pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend 

in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her 
she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte  she felt too much
in the secret herself  to think the appearance of curiosity
or interest fair  and therefore purposely kept at a distance 
but by the others  the subject was almost immediately introduced 
and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations
were received  the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of  my
excellent friend colonel campbell  

mrs  weston  kind hearted and musical  was particularly interested
by the circumstance  and emma could not help being amused at her
perseverance in dwelling on the subject  and having so much to ask
and to say as to tone  touch  and pedal  totally unsuspicious
of that wish of saying as little about it as possible  which she
plainly read in the fair heroine s countenance 

they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen  and the very first of the
early was frank churchill   in he walked  the first and the handsomest 
and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and
her niece  made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle 
where sat miss woodhouse  and till he could find a seat by her 
would not sit at all   emma divined what every body present must
be thinking   she was his object  and every body must perceive it 
she introduced him to her friend  miss smith  and  at convenient
moments afterwards  heard what each thought of the other    he had
never seen so lovely a face  and was delighted with her naivete  
and she   only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment 
but she did think there were some looks a little like mr  elton  
emma restrained her indignation  and only turned from her in silence 

smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first
glancing towards miss fairfax  but it was most prudent to avoid speech 
he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room  
hated sitting long  was always the first to move when he could  
that his father  mr  knightley  mr  cox  and mr  cole  were left
very busy over parish business  that as long as he had staid 
however  it had been pleasant enough  as he had found them in general
a set of gentlemanlike  sensible men  and spoke so handsomely of
highbury altogether  thought it so abundant in agreeable families  
that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place
rather too much   she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire  
the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe  and the sort 
and could make out from his answers that  as far as enscombe
was concerned  there was very little going on  that their visitings
were among a range of great families  none very near  and that even
when days were fixed  and invitations accepted  it was an even
chance that mrs  churchill were not in health and spirits for going 
that they made a point of visiting no fresh person  and that 
though he had his separate engagements  it was not without difficulty 
without considerable address  at   times   that he could get away 
or introduce an acquaintance for a night 

she saw that enscombe could not satisfy  and that highbury 
taken at its best  might reasonably please a young man who had more
retirement at home than he liked   his importance at enscombe was
very evident   he did not boast  but it naturally betrayed itself 
that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing 
and on her laughing and noticing it  he owned that he believed  excepting
one or two points  he could  with   time  persuade her to any thing 
one of those points on which his influence failed  he then mentioned 
he had wanted very much to go abroad  had been very eager indeed
to be allowed to travel  but she would not hear of it   this had
happened the year before    now   he said  he was beginning to have
no longer the same wish 

the unpersuadable point  which he did not mention  emma guessed
to be good behaviour to his father 

 i have made a most wretched discovery   said he  after a short pause   
 i have been here a week to morrow  half my time   i never knew
days fly so fast   a week to morrow   and i have hardly begun to
enjoy myself   but just got acquainted with mrs  weston  and others   
i hate the recollection  

 perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day 
out of so few  in having your hair cut  

 no   said he  smiling   that is no subject of regret at all 
i have no pleasure in seeing my friends  unless i can believe myself
fit to be seen  

the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room  emma found herself
obliged to turn from him for a few minutes  and listen to mr  cole 
when mr  cole had moved away  and her attention could be restored
as before  she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room
at miss fairfax  who was sitting exactly opposite 

 what is the matter   said she 

he started    thank you for rousing me   he replied    i believe
i have been very rude  but really miss fairfax has done her hair
in so odd a way  so very odd a way  that i cannot keep my eyes
from her   i never saw any thing so outree   those curls   this must
be a fancy of her own   i see nobody else looking like her   
i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion   shall i   
yes  i will  i declare i will  and you shall see how she takes it   
whether she colours  

he was gone immediately  and emma soon saw him standing before miss
fairfax  and talking to her  but as to its effect on the young lady 
as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them  exactly
in front of miss fairfax  she could absolutely distinguish nothing 

before he could return to his chair  it was taken by mrs  weston 

 this is the luxury of a large party   said she    one can get
near every body  and say every thing   my dear emma  i am longing
to talk to you   i have been making discoveries and forming plans 
just like yourself  and i must tell them while the idea is fresh 
do you know how miss bates and her niece came here  

 how   they were invited  were not they  

 oh  yes  but how they were conveyed hither   the manner of their coming  

 they walked  i conclude   how else could they come  

 very true   well  a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad
it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again  late at night 
and cold as the nights are now   and as i looked at her  though i
never saw her appear to more advantage  it struck me that she
was heated  and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold 
poor girl   i could not bear the idea of it  so  as soon as mr  weston
came into the room  and i could get at him  i spoke to him about
the carriage   you may guess how readily he came into my wishes 
and having his approbation  i made my way directly to miss bates 
to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took
us home  for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once 
good soul  she was as grateful as possible  you may be sure 
 nobody was ever so fortunate as herself    but with many 
many thanks   there was no occasion to trouble us  for mr  knightley s
carriage had brought  and was to take them home again    i was
quite surprized   very glad  i am sure  but really quite surprized 
such a very kind attention  and so thoughtful an attention   
the sort of thing that so few men would think of   and  in short 
from knowing his usual ways  i am very much inclined to think
that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all 
i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself 
and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them  

 very likely   said emma   nothing more likely   i know no man
more likely than mr  knightley to do the sort of thing  to do any
thing really good natured  useful  considerate  or benevolent 
he is not a gallant man  but he is a very humane one  and this 
considering jane fairfax s ill health  would appear a case
of humanity to him   and for an act of unostentatious kindness 
there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr  knightley 
i know he had horses to day  for we arrived together  and i laughed at
him about it  but he said not a word that could betray  

 well   said mrs  weston  smiling   you give him credit for
more simple  disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do 
for while miss bates was speaking  a suspicion darted into my head 
and i have never been able to get it out again   the more i think
of it  the more probable it appears   in short  i have made a match
between mr  knightley and jane fairfax   see the consequence
of keeping you company   what do you say to it  

 mr  knightley and jane fairfax   exclaimed emma    dear mrs  weston 
how could you think of such a thing   mr  knightley   mr  knightley
must not marry   you would not have little henry cut out from donwell   
oh  no  no  henry must have donwell   i cannot at all consent to
mr  knightley s marrying  and i am sure it is not at all likely 
i am amazed that you should think of such a thing  

 my dear emma  i have told you what led me to think of it 
i do not want the match  i do not want to injure dear little henry  
but the idea has been given me by circumstances  and if mr  knightley
really wished to marry  you would not have him refrain on henry s
account  a boy of six years old  who knows nothing of the matter  

 yes  i would   i could not bear to have henry supplanted   
mr  knightley marry   no  i have never had such an idea  and i
cannot adopt it now   and jane fairfax  too  of all women  

 nay  she has always been a first favourite with him  as you
very well know  

 but the imprudence of such a match  

 i am not speaking of its prudence  merely its probability  

 i see no probability in it  unless you have any better foundation
than what you mention   his good nature  his humanity  as i tell you 
would be quite enough to account for the horses   he has a great
regard for the bateses  you know  independent of jane fairfax  
and is always glad to shew them attention   my dear mrs  weston 
do not take to match making   you do it very ill   jane fairfax mistress
of the abbey   oh  no  no   every feeling revolts   for his own sake 
i would not have him do so mad a thing  

 imprudent  if you please  but not mad   excepting inequality of fortune 
and perhaps a little disparity of age  i can see nothing unsuitable  

 but mr  knightley does not want to marry   i am sure he has not the
least idea of it   do not put it into his head   why should he marry   
he is as happy as possible by himself  with his farm  and his sheep 
and his library  and all the parish to manage  and he is extremely
fond of his brother s children   he has no occasion to marry 
either to fill up his time or his heart  

 my dear emma  as long as he thinks so  it is so  but if he really
loves jane fairfax   

 nonsense   he does not care about jane fairfax   in the way
of love  i am sure he does not   he would do any good to her 
or her family  but   

 well   said mrs  weston  laughing   perhaps the greatest good he
could do them  would be to give jane such a respectable home  

 if it would be good to her  i am sure it would be evil to himself 
a very shameful and degrading connexion   how would he bear to have
miss bates belonging to him   to have her haunting the abbey 
and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane   
 so very kind and obliging   but he always had been such a very
kind neighbour    and then fly off  through half a sentence 
to her mother s old petticoat    not that it was such a very old
petticoat either  for still it would last a great while  and  indeed 
she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong   

 for shame  emma   do not mimic her   you divert me against
my conscience   and  upon my word  i do not think mr  knightley would
be much disturbed by miss bates   little things do not irritate him 
she might talk on  and if he wanted to say any thing himself  he would
only talk louder  and drown her voice   but the question is not 
whether it would be a bad connexion for him  but whether he wishes it 
and i think he does   i have heard him speak  and so must you 
so very highly of jane fairfax   the interest he takes in her  
his anxiety about her health  his concern that she should have no
happier prospect   i have heard him express himself so warmly on
those points   such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte 
and of her voice   i have heard him say that he could listen to her
for ever   oh  and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred
to me  this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody  
though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present
from the campbells  may it not be from mr  knightley   i cannot
help suspecting him   i think he is just the person to do it 
even without being in love  

 then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love 
but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do 
mr  knightley does nothing mysteriously  

 i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly 
oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would  in the common
course of things  occur to him  

 very well  and if he had intended to give her one  he would have
told her so  

 there might be scruples of delicacy  my dear emma   i have a very
strong notion that it comes from him   i am sure he was particularly
silent when mrs  cole told us of it at dinner  

 you take up an idea  mrs  weston  and run away with it  as you have
many a time reproached me with doing   i see no sign of attachment  
i believe nothing of the pianoforte  and proof only shall convince
me that mr  knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax  

they combated the point some time longer in the same way  emma rather
gaining ground over the mind of her friend  for mrs  weston was
the most used of the two to yield  till a little bustle in the room
shewed them that tea was over  and the instrument in preparation   
and at the same moment mr  cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse
would do them the honour of trying it   frank churchill  of whom 
in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs  weston  she had been
seeing nothing  except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax 
followed mr  cole  to add his very pressing entreaties  and as 
in every respect  it suited emma best to lead  she gave a very
proper compliance 

she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt
more than she could perform with credit  she wanted neither taste
nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable 
and could accompany her own voice well   one accompaniment to her song
took her agreeably by surprize  a second  slightly but correctly
taken by frank churchill   her pardon was duly begged at the close
of the song  and every thing usual followed   he was accused
of having a delightful voice  and a perfect knowledge of music 
which was properly denied  and that he knew nothing of the matter 
and had no voice at all  roundly asserted   they sang together
once more  and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax 
whose performance  both vocal and instrumental  she never could
attempt to conceal from herself  was infinitely superior to her own 

with mixed feelings  she seated herself at a little distance from the
numbers round the instrument  to listen   frank churchill sang again 
they had sung together once or twice  it appeared  at weymouth 
but the sight of mr  knightley among the most attentive  soon drew
away half emma s mind  and she fell into a train of thinking
on the subject of mrs  weston s suspicions  to which the sweet
sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions 
her objections to mr  knightley s marrying did not in the least subside 
she could see nothing but evil in it   it would be a great
disappointment to mr  john knightley  consequently to isabella 
a real injury to the children  a most mortifying change 
and material loss to them all   a very great deduction from her
father s daily comfort  and  as to herself  she could not at all
endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey   a mrs  knightley
for them all to give way to   no  mr  knightley must never marry 
little henry must remain the heir of donwell 

presently mr  knightley looked back  and came and sat down by her 
they talked at first only of the performance   his admiration
was certainly very warm  yet she thought  but for mrs  weston 
it would not have struck her   as a sort of touchstone  however 
she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece 
and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short 
she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any
kindness of his own 

 i often feel concern   said she   that i dare not make our carriage
more useful on such occasions   it is not that i am without the wish 
but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james
should put to for such a purpose  

 quite out of the question  quite out of the question   he replied   
 but you must often wish it  i am sure    and he smiled with such
seeming pleasure at the conviction  that she must proceed another step 

 this present from the campbells   said she   this pianoforte
is very kindly given  

 yes   he replied  and without the smallest apparent embarrassment   
 but they would have done better had they given her notice of it 
surprizes are foolish things   the pleasure is not enhanced  and the
inconvenience is often considerable   i should have expected better
judgment in colonel campbell  

from that moment  emma could have taken her oath that mr  knightley
had had no concern in giving the instrument   but whether he
were entirely free from peculiar attachment  whether there
were no actual preference  remained a little longer doubtful 
towards the end of jane s second song  her voice grew thick 

 that will do   said he  when it was finished  thinking aloud  
 you have sung quite enough for one evening  now be quiet  

another song  however  was soon begged for    one more   they would
not fatigue miss fairfax on any account  and would only ask for
one more    and frank churchill was heard to say   i think you could
manage this without effort  the first part is so very trifling 
the strength of the song falls on the second  

mr  knightley grew angry 

 that fellow   said he  indignantly   thinks of nothing but shewing
off his own voice   this must not be    and touching miss bates 
who at that moment passed near   miss bates  are you mad  to let
your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner   go  and interfere 
they have no mercy on her  

miss bates  in her real anxiety for jane  could hardly stay even
to be grateful  before she stept forward and put an end to all
farther singing   here ceased the concert part of the evening 
for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers 
but soon  within five minutes  the proposal of dancing  
originating nobody exactly knew where  was so effectually promoted
by mr  and mrs  cole  that every thing was rapidly clearing away 
to give proper space   mrs  weston  capital in her country dances 
was seated  and beginning an irresistible waltz  and frank churchill 
coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma  had secured her hand 
and led her up to the top 

while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off 
emma found time  in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her
voice and her taste  to look about  and see what became of mr  knightley 
this would be a trial   he was no dancer in general   if he were to be
very alert in engaging jane fairfax now  it might augur something 
there was no immediate appearance   no  he was talking to mrs  cole  
he was looking on unconcerned  jane was asked by somebody else 
and he was still talking to mrs  cole 

emma had no longer an alarm for henry  his interest was yet safe 
and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment 
not more than five couple could be mustered  but the rarity and the
suddenness of it made it very delightful  and she found herself well
matched in a partner   they were a couple worth looking at 

two dances  unfortunately  were all that could be allowed 
it was growing late  and miss bates became anxious to get home 
on her mother s account   after some attempts  therefore  to be
permitted to begin again  they were obliged to thank mrs  weston 
look sorrowful  and have done 

 perhaps it is as well   said frank churchill  as he attended emma
to her carriage    i must have asked miss fairfax  and her languid
dancing would not have agreed with me  after your s  



chapter ix


emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles 
the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day 
and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side
of dignified seclusion  must be amply repaid in the splendour
of popularity   she must have delighted the coles  worthy people 
who deserved to be made happy   and left a name behind her that would
not soon die away 

perfect happiness  even in memory  is not common  and there were
two points on which she was not quite easy   she doubted whether
she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman  in betraying
her suspicions of jane fairfax s feelings to frank churchill 
it was hardly right  but it had been so strong an idea  that it
would escape her  and his submission to all that she told 
was a compliment to her penetration  which made it difficult
for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue 

the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax 
and there she had no doubt   she did unfeignedly and unequivocally
regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing   she did
most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood  and sat
down and practised vigorously an hour and a half 

she was then interrupted by harriet s coming in  and if harriet s
praise could have satisfied her  she might soon have been comforted 

 oh  if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax  

 don t class us together  harriet   my playing is no more like
her s  than a lamp is like sunshine  

 oh  dear  i think you play the best of the two   i think you play
quite as well as she does   i am sure i had much rather hear you 
every body last night said how well you played  

 those who knew any thing about it  must have felt the difference 
the truth is  harriet  that my playing is just good enough to be praised 
but jane fairfax s is much beyond it  

 well  i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does 
or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out 
mr  cole said how much taste you had  and mr  frank churchill talked
a great deal about your taste  and that he valued taste much more
than execution  

 ah  but jane fairfax has them both  harriet  

 are you sure   i saw she had execution  but i did not know she had
any taste   nobody talked about it   and i hate italian singing   
there is no understanding a word of it   besides  if she does play
so very well  you know  it is no more than she is obliged to do 
because she will have to teach   the coxes were wondering last night
whether she would get into any great family   how did you think the
coxes looked  

 just as they always do  very vulgar  

 they told me something   said harriet rather hesitatingly  
but it is nothing of any consequence  

emma was obliged to ask what they had told her  though fearful
of its producing mr  elton 

 they told me  that mr  martin dined with them last saturday  

 oh  

 he came to their father upon some business  and he asked him
to stay to dinner  

 oh  

 they talked a great deal about him  especially anne cox 
i do not know what she meant  but she asked me if i thought i
should go and stay there again next summer  

 she meant to be impertinently curious  just as such an anne cox
should be  

 she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there   he sat
by her at dinner   miss nash thinks either of the coxes would
be very glad to marry him  

 very likely   i think they are  without exception  the most vulgar
girls in highbury  

harriet had business at ford s   emma thought it most prudent to go
with her   another accidental meeting with the martins was possible 
and in her present state  would be dangerous 

harriet  tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word  was always
very long at a purchase  and while she was still hanging over muslins
and changing her mind  emma went to the door for amusement   much could
not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury   
mr  perry walking hastily by  mr  william cox letting himself in at
the office door  mr  cole s carriage horses returning from exercise 
or a stray letter boy on an obstinate mule  were the liveliest
objects she could presume to expect  and when her eyes fell only on
the butcher with his tray  a tidy old woman travelling homewards from
shop with her full basket  two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone 
and a string of dawdling children round the baker s little bow window
eyeing the gingerbread  she knew she had no reason to complain 
and was amused enough  quite enough still to stand at the door 
a mind lively and at ease  can do with seeing nothing  and can see
nothing that does not answer 

she looked down the randalls road   the scene enlarged 
two persons appeared  mrs  weston and her son in law  they were
walking into highbury   to hartfield of course   they were stopping 
however  in the first place at mrs  bates s  whose house was
a little nearer randalls than ford s  and had all but knocked 
when emma caught their eye   immediately they crossed the road
and came forward to her  and the agreeableness of yesterday s
engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting 
mrs  weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses 
in order to hear the new instrument 

 for my companion tells me   said she   that i absolutely promised
miss bates last night  that i would come this morning   i was
not aware of it myself   i did not know that i had fixed a day 
but as he says i did  i am going now  

 and while mrs  weston pays her visit  i may be allowed  i hope  
said frank churchill   to join your party and wait for her at hartfield  
if you are going home  

mrs  weston was disappointed 

 i thought you meant to go with me   they would be very much pleased  

 me   i should be quite in the way   but  perhaps  i may be equally
in the way here   miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me 
my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping   she says i fidget
her to death  and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say
the same   what am i to do  

 i am here on no business of my own   said emma   i am only waiting
for my friend   she will probably have soon done  and then we
shall go home   but you had better go with mrs  weston and hear
the instrument  

 well  if you advise it   but  with a smile  if colonel campbell
should have employed a careless friend  and if it should prove
to have an indifferent tone  what shall i say   i shall be no
support to mrs  weston   she might do very well by herself 
a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips  but i
am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood  

 i do not believe any such thing   replied emma    i am persuaded
that you can be as insincere as your neighbours  when it is necessary 
but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent 
quite otherwise indeed  if i understood miss fairfax s opinion
last night  

 do come with me   said mrs  weston   if it be not very disagreeable
to you   it need not detain us long   we will go to hartfield afterwards 
we will follow them to hartfield   i really wish you to call with me 
it will be felt so great an attention  and i always thought you
meant it  

he could say no more  and with the hope of hartfield to reward him 
returned with mrs  weston to mrs  bates s door   emma watched them in 
and then joined harriet at the interesting counter   trying  with all
the force of her own mind  to convince her that if she wanted plain
muslin it was of no use to look at figured  and that a blue ribbon 
be it ever so beautiful  would still never match her yellow pattern 
at last it was all settled  even to the destination of the parcel 

 should i send it to mrs  goddard s  ma am   asked mrs  ford   
 yes  no  yes  to mrs  goddard s  only my pattern gown is
at hartfield   no  you shall send it to hartfield  if you please 
but then  mrs  goddard will want to see it   and i could take the
pattern gown home any day   but i shall want the ribbon directly  
so it had better go to hartfield  at least the ribbon   you could
make it into two parcels  mrs  ford  could not you  

 it is not worth while  harriet  to give mrs  ford the trouble
of two parcels  

 no more it is  

 no trouble in the world  ma am   said the obliging mrs  ford 

 oh  but indeed i would much rather have it only in one 
then  if you please  you shall send it all to mrs  goddard s  
i do not know  no  i think  miss woodhouse  i may just as well
have it sent to hartfield  and take it home with me at night 
what do you advise  

 that you do not give another half second to the subject 
to hartfield  if you please  mrs  ford  

 aye  that will be much best   said harriet  quite satisfied 
 i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs  goddard s  

voices approached the shop  or rather one voice and two ladies 
mrs  weston and miss bates met them at the door 

 my dear miss woodhouse   said the latter   i am just run across to
entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while 
and give us your opinion of our new instrument  you and miss smith 
how do you do  miss smith   very well i thank you   and i begged
mrs  weston to come with me  that i might be sure of succeeding  

 i hope mrs  bates and miss fairfax are   

 very well  i am much obliged to you   my mother is delightfully well 
and jane caught no cold last night   how is mr  woodhouse   i am so glad
to hear such a good account   mrs  weston told me you were here   
oh  then  said i  i must run across  i am sure miss woodhouse will
allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in  my mother
will be so very happy to see her  and now we are such a nice party 
she cannot refuse    aye  pray do   said mr  frank churchill 
 miss woodhouse s opinion of the instrument will be worth having    
but  said i  i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go
with me    oh   said he   wait half a minute  till i have finished
my job    for  would you believe it  miss woodhouse  there he is 
in the most obliging manner in the world  fastening in the rivet of my
mother s spectacles   the rivet came out  you know  this morning   
so very obliging   for my mother had no use of her spectacles  
could not put them on   and  by the bye  every body ought to have
two pair of spectacles  they should indeed   jane said so 
i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did 
but something or other hindered me all the morning  first one thing 
then another  there is no saying what  you know   at one time patty came
to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping   oh  said i 
patty do not come with your bad news to me   here is the rivet
of your mistress s spectacles out   then the baked apples came home 
mrs  wallis sent them by her boy  they are extremely civil and
obliging to us  the wallises  always  i have heard some people
say that mrs  wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer 
but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention
from them   and it cannot be for the value of our custom now 
for what is our consumption of bread  you know   only three of us   
besides dear jane at present  and she really eats nothing  makes such
a shocking breakfast  you would be quite frightened if you saw it 
i dare not let my mother know how little she eats  so i say one
thing and then i say another  and it passes off   but about the
middle of the day she gets hungry  and there is nothing she likes
so well as these baked apples  and they are extremely wholesome 
for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr  perry 
i happened to meet him in the street   not that i had any doubt before  
i have so often heard mr  woodhouse recommend a baked apple 
i believe it is the only way that mr  woodhouse thinks the
fruit thoroughly wholesome   we have apple dumplings  however 
very often   patty makes an excellent apple dumpling  well 
mrs  weston  you have prevailed  i hope  and these ladies will
oblige us  

emma would be  very happy to wait on mrs  bates   c    and they
did at last move out of the shop  with no farther delay from miss
bates than 

 how do you do  mrs  ford   i beg your pardon   i did not see
you before   i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons
from town   jane came back delighted yesterday   thank ye 
the gloves do very well  only a little too large about the wrist 
but jane is taking them in  

 what was i talking of   said she  beginning again when they were
all in the street 

emma wondered on what  of all the medley  she would fix 

 i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of   oh  my
mother s spectacles   so very obliging of mr  frank churchill 
 oh   said he   i do think i can fasten the rivet  i like a job
of this kind excessively    which you know shewed him to be so
very        indeed i must say that  much as i had heard of him
before and much as i had expected  he very far exceeds any
thing        i do congratulate you  mrs  weston  most warmly 
he seems every thing the fondest parent could         oh   said he 
 i can fasten the rivet   i like a job of that sort excessively  
i never shall forget his manner   and when i brought out the baked
apples from the closet  and hoped our friends would be so very
obliging as to take some   oh   said he directly   there is nothing
in the way of fruit half so good  and these are the finest looking
home baked apples i ever saw in my life    that  you know  was so
very        and i am sure  by his manner  it was no compliment 
indeed they are very delightful apples  and mrs  wallis does them
full justice  only we do not have them baked more than twice 
and mr  woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times  
but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it   the apples
themselves are the very finest sort for baking  beyond a doubt 
all from donwell  some of mr  knightley s most liberal supply 
he sends us a sack every year  and certainly there never was such
a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees  i believe there
is two of them   my mother says the orchard was always famous
in her younger days   but i was really quite shocked the other day  
for mr  knightley called one morning  and jane was eating these apples 
and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them 
and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock 
 i am sure you must be   said he   and i will send you
another supply  for i have a great many more than i can ever use 
william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year 
i will send you some more  before they get good for nothing  
so i begged he would not  for really as to ours being gone  i could
not absolutely say that we had a great many left  it was but half
a dozen indeed  but they should be all kept for jane  and i could
not at all bear that he should be sending us more  so liberal as he
had been already  and jane said the same   and when he was gone 
she almost quarrelled with me  no  i should not say quarrelled 
for we never had a quarrel in our lives  but she was quite distressed
that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone  she wished i had
made him believe we had a great many left   oh  said i  my dear 
i did say as much as i could   however  the very same evening
william larkins came over with a large basket of apples  the same
sort of apples  a bushel at least  and i was very much obliged 
and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing 
as you may suppose   william larkins is such an old acquaintance 
i am always glad to see him   but  however  i found afterwards
from patty  that william said it was all the apples of  that  sort
his master had  he had brought them all  and now his master had not
one left to bake or boil   william did not seem to mind it himself 
he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many  for william 
you know  thinks more of his master s profit than any thing 
but mrs  hodges  he said  was quite displeased at their being
all sent away   she could not bear that her master should not be
able to have another apple tart this spring   he told patty this 
but bid her not mind it  and be sure not to say any thing to us
about it  for mrs  hodges  would  be cross sometimes  and as long as
so many sacks were sold  it did not signify who ate the remainder 
and so patty told me  and i was excessively shocked indeed 
i would not have mr  knightley know any thing about it for
the world   he would be so very        i wanted to keep it from
jane s knowledge  but  unluckily  i had mentioned it before i was
aware  

miss bates had just done as patty opened the door  and her visitors
walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to 
pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good will 

 pray take care  mrs  weston  there is a step at the turning 
pray take care  miss woodhouse  ours is rather a dark staircase  
rather darker and narrower than one could wish   miss smith 
pray take care   miss woodhouse  i am quite concerned  i am sure you
hit your foot   miss smith  the step at the turning  



chapter x


the appearance of the little sitting room as they entered 
was tranquillity itself  mrs  bates  deprived of her usual employment 
slumbering on one side of the fire  frank churchill  at a table
near her  most deedily occupied about her spectacles  and jane fairfax 
standing with her back to them  intent on her pianoforte 

busy as he was  however  the young man was yet able to shew a most
happy countenance on seeing emma again 

 this is a pleasure   said he  in rather a low voice   coming at
least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated   you find me
trying to be useful  tell me if you think i shall succeed  

 what   said mrs  weston   have not you finished it yet  you would
not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate  

 i have not been working uninterruptedly   he replied   i have been
assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily 
it was not quite firm  an unevenness in the floor  i believe 
you see we have been wedging one leg with paper   this was very kind
of you to be persuaded to come   i was almost afraid you would be
hurrying home  

he contrived that she should be seated by him  and was sufficiently
employed in looking out the best baked apple for her  and trying
to make her help or advise him in his work  till jane fairfax was
quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again   that she was not
immediately ready  emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves 
she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it
without emotion  she must reason herself into the power of performance 
and emma could not but pity such feelings  whatever their origin 
and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again 

at last jane began  and though the first bars were feebly given 
the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to 
mrs  weston had been delighted before  and was delighted again 
emma joined her in all her praise  and the pianoforte  with every
proper discrimination  was pronounced to be altogether of the
highest promise 

 whoever colonel campbell might employ   said frank churchill 
with a smile at emma   the person has not chosen ill   i heard a good
deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth  and the softness of the
upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and  all   that   party  would
particularly prize   i dare say  miss fairfax  that he either gave
his friend very minute directions  or wrote to broadwood himself 
do not you think so  

jane did not look round   she was not obliged to hear   mrs  weston
had been speaking to her at the same moment 

 it is not fair   said emma  in a whisper   mine was a random guess 
do not distress her  

he shook his head with a smile  and looked as if he had very little
doubt and very little mercy   soon afterwards he began again 

 how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure
on this occasion  miss fairfax   i dare say they often think of you 
and wonder which will be the day  the precise day of the instrument s
coming to hand   do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business
to be going forward just at this time   do you imagine it to be
the consequence of an immediate commission from him  or that he may
have sent only a general direction  an order indefinite as to time 
to depend upon contingencies and conveniences  

he paused   she could not but hear  she could not avoid answering 

 till i have a letter from colonel campbell   said she  in a voice
of forced calmness   i can imagine nothing with any confidence 
it must be all conjecture  

 conjecture  aye  sometimes one conjectures right  and sometimes
one conjectures wrong   i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall
make this rivet quite firm   what nonsense one talks  miss woodhouse 
when hard at work  if one talks at all   your real workmen 
i suppose  hold their tongues  but we gentlemen labourers if we get
hold of a word  miss fairfax said something about conjecturing 
there  it is done   i have the pleasure  madam   to mrs  bates  
of restoring your spectacles  healed for the present  

he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter  to escape
a little from the latter  he went to the pianoforte  and begged
miss fairfax  who was still sitting at it  to play something more 

 if you are very kind   said he   it will be one of the waltzes
we danced last night   let me live them over again   you did not
enjoy them as i did  you appeared tired the whole time   i believe
you were glad we danced no longer  but i would have given worlds  
all the worlds one ever has to give  for another half hour  

she played 

 what felicity it is to hear a tune again which  has  made one happy   
if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth  

she looked up at him for a moment  coloured deeply  and played
something else   he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte 
and turning to emma  said 

 here is something quite new to me   do you know it   cramer   
and here are a new set of irish melodies   that  from such a quarter 
one might expect   this was all sent with the instrument   very thoughtful
of colonel campbell  was not it   he knew miss fairfax could have
no music here   i honour that part of the attention particularly 
it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart   nothing hastily
done  nothing incomplete   true affection only could have prompted it  

emma wished he would be less pointed  yet could not help being amused 
and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught
the remains of a smile  when she saw that with all the deep blush
of consciousness  there had been a smile of secret delight 
she had less scruple in the amusement  and much less compunction
with respect to her   this amiable  upright  perfect jane fairfax
was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings 

he brought all the music to her  and they looked it over together   
emma took the opportunity of whispering 

 you speak too plain   she must understand you  

 i hope she does   i would have her understand me   i am not
in the least ashamed of my meaning  

 but really  i am half ashamed  and wish i had never taken up
the idea  

 i am very glad you did  and that you communicated it to me 
i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways   leave shame to her 
if she does wrong  she ought to feel it  

 she is not entirely without it  i think  

 i do not see much sign of it   she is playing  robin   adair 
at this moment   his  favourite  

shortly afterwards miss bates  passing near the window 
descried mr  knightley on horse back not far off 

 mr  knightley i declare   i must speak to him if possible 
just to thank him   i will not open the window here  it would give
you all cold  but i can go into my mother s room you know   i dare
say he will come in when he knows who is here   quite delightful
to have you all meet so   our little room so honoured  

she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke  and opening
the casement there  immediately called mr  knightley s attention 
and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard
by the others  as if it had passed within the same apartment 

 how d  ye do   how d ye do   very well  i thank you   so obliged
to you for the carriage last night   we were just in time 
my mother just ready for us   pray come in  do come in   you will
find some friends here  

so began miss bates  and mr  knightley seemed determined to be heard
in his turn  for most resolutely and commandingly did he say 

 how is your niece  miss bates   i want to inquire after you all 
but particularly your niece   how is miss fairfax   i hope she
caught no cold last night   how is she to day  tell me how miss
fairfax is  

and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he
would hear her in any thing else   the listeners were amused 
and mrs  weston gave emma a look of particular meaning   but emma
still shook her head in steady scepticism 

 so obliged to you   so very much obliged to you for the carriage  
resumed miss bates 

he cut her short with 

 i am going to kingston   can i do any thing for you  

 oh  dear  kingston  are you   mrs  cole was saying the other day
she wanted something from kingston  

 mrs  cole has servants to send   can i do any thing for  you   

 no  i thank you   but do come in   who do you think is here   
miss woodhouse and miss smith  so kind as to call to hear the
new pianoforte   do put up your horse at the crown  and come in  

 well   said he  in a deliberating manner   for five minutes  perhaps  

 and here is mrs  weston and mr  frank churchill too   quite delightful 
so many friends  

 no  not now  i thank you   i could not stay two minutes 
i must get on to kingston as fast as i can  

 oh  do come in   they will be so very happy to see you  

 no  no  your room is full enough   i will call another day 
and hear the pianoforte  

 well  i am so sorry   oh   mr  knightley  what a delightful party
last night  how extremely pleasant   did you ever see such dancing   
was not it delightful   miss woodhouse and mr  frank churchill 
i never saw any thing equal to it  

 oh  very delightful indeed  i can say nothing less  for i suppose
miss woodhouse and mr  frank churchill are hearing every thing
that passes   and  raising his voice still more  i do not see why miss
fairfax should not be mentioned too   i think miss fairfax dances
very well  and mrs  weston is the very best country dance player 
without exception  in england   now  if your friends have any gratitude 
they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return 
but i cannot stay to hear it  

 oh   mr  knightley  one moment more  something of consequence  
so shocked   jane and i are both so shocked about the apples  

 what is the matter now  

 to think of your sending us all your store apples   you said you had
a great many  and now you have not one left   we really are so shocked 
mrs  hodges may well be angry   william larkins mentioned it here 
you should not have done it  indeed you should not   ah  he is off 
he never can bear to be thanked   but i thought he would have staid now 
and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned        well 
 returning to the room   i have not been able to succeed 
mr  knightley cannot stop   he is going to kingston   he asked me
if he could do any thing        

 yes   said jane   we heard his kind offers  we heard every thing  

 oh  yes  my dear  i dare say you might  because you know  the door
was open  and the window was open  and mr  knightley spoke loud 
you must have heard every thing to be sure    can i do any thing
for you at kingston   said he  so i just mentioned        oh 
miss woodhouse  must you be going   you seem but just come  so very
obliging of you  

emma found it really time to be at home  the visit had already
lasted long  and on examining watches  so much of the morning was
perceived to be gone  that mrs  weston and her companion taking
leave also  could allow themselves only to walk with the two young
ladies to hartfield gates  before they set off for randalls 



chapter xi


it may be possible to do without dancing entirely   instances have
been known of young people passing many  many months successively 
without being at any ball of any description  and no material injury
accrue either to body or mind   but when a beginning is made  
when the felicities of rapid motion have once been  though slightly 
felt  it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more 

frank churchill had danced once at highbury  and longed to dance again 
and the last half hour of an evening which mr  woodhouse was persuaded
to spend with his daughter at randalls  was passed by the two young
people in schemes on the subject   frank s was the first idea 
and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it  for the lady was the best
judge of the difficulties  and the most solicitous for accommodation
and appearance   but still she had inclination enough for shewing
people again how delightfully mr  frank churchill and miss
woodhouse danced  for doing that in which she need not blush to compare
herself with jane fairfax  and even for simple dancing itself 
without any of the wicked aids of vanity  to assist him first
in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made
to hold  and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour 
in the hope of discovering  in spite of all that mr  weston could
say of their exactly equal size  that it was a little the largest 

his first proposition and request  that the dance begun at mr  cole s
should be finished there  that the same party should be collected 
and the same musician engaged  met with the readiest acquiescence 
mr  weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment 
and mrs  weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they
could wish to dance  and the interesting employment had followed 
of reckoning up exactly who there would be  and portioning out the
indispensable division of space to every couple 

 you and miss smith  and miss fairfax  will be three  and the two
miss coxes five   had been repeated many times over    and there
will be the two gilberts  young cox  my father  and myself 
besides mr  knightley   yes  that will be quite enough for pleasure 
you and miss smith  and miss fairfax  will be three  and the two miss
coxes five  and for five couple there will be plenty of room  

but soon it came to be on one side 

 but will there be good room for five couple   i really do not think
there will  

on another 

 and after all  five couple are not enough to make it worth
while to stand up   five couple are nothing  when one thinks
seriously about it   it will not do to  invite  five couple 
it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment  

somebody said that  miss  gilbert was expected at her brother s 
and must be invited with the rest   somebody else believed
 mrs   gilbert would have danced the other evening  if she had
been asked   a word was put in for a second young cox  and at last 
mr  weston naming one family of cousins who must be included 
and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out 
it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten 
and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they
could be disposed of 

the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other 
 might not they use both rooms  and dance across the passage  
it seemed the best scheme  and yet it was not so good but that
many of them wanted a better   emma said it would be awkward 
mrs  weston was in distress about the supper  and mr  woodhouse
opposed it earnestly  on the score of health   it made him so
very unhappy  indeed  that it could not be persevered in 

 oh  no   said he   it would be the extreme of imprudence 
i could not bear it for emma   emma is not strong   she would
catch a dreadful cold   so would poor little harriet 
so you would all   mrs  weston  you would be quite laid up 
do not let them talk of such a wild thing   pray do not let them
talk of it   that young man  speaking lower  is very thoughtless 
do not tell his father  but that young man is not quite the thing 
he has been opening the doors very often this evening  and keeping
them open very inconsiderately   he does not think of the draught 
i do not mean to set you against him  but indeed he is not quite
the thing  

mrs  weston was sorry for such a charge   she knew the importance
of it  and said every thing in her power to do it away   every door
was now closed  the passage plan given up  and the first scheme
of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again 
and with such good will on frank churchill s part  that the space
which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient
for five couple  was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough
for ten 

 we were too magnificent   said he    we allowed unnecessary room 
ten couple may stand here very well  

emma demurred    it would be a crowd  a sad crowd  and what could
be worse than dancing without space to turn in  

 very true   he gravely replied   it was very bad    but still he
went on measuring  and still he ended with 

 i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple  

 no  no   said she   you are quite unreasonable   it would be dreadful
to be standing so close   nothing can be farther from pleasure
than to be dancing in a crowd  and a crowd in a little room  

 there is no denying it   he replied    i agree with you exactly 
a crowd in a little room  miss woodhouse  you have the art of giving
pictures in a few words   exquisite  quite exquisite   still  however 
having proceeded so far  one is unwilling to give the matter up 
it would be a disappointment to my father  and altogether  i do
not know that  i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand
here very well  

emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little
self willed  and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure
of dancing with her  but she took the compliment  and forgave
the rest   had she intended ever to  marry  him  it might have been
worth while to pause and consider  and try to understand the value
of his preference  and the character of his temper  but for
all the purposes of their acquaintance  he was quite amiable enough 

before the middle of the next day  he was at hartfield  and he entered
the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance
of the scheme   it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement 

 well  miss woodhouse   he almost immediately began   your inclination
for dancing has not been quite frightened away  i hope  by the
terrors of my father s little rooms   i bring a new proposal
on the subject   a thought of my father s  which waits only your
approbation to be acted upon   may i hope for the honour of your
hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball 
to be given  not at randalls  but at the crown inn  

 the crown  

 yes  if you and mr  woodhouse see no objection  and i trust you cannot 
my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there 
better accommodations  he can promise them  and not a less grateful
welcome than at randalls   it is his own idea   mrs  weston sees
no objection to it  provided you are satisfied   this is what we
all feel   oh  you were perfectly right   ten couple  in either of
the randalls rooms  would have been insufferable   dreadful   i felt
how right you were the whole time  but was too anxious for securing
 any   thing  to like to yield   is not it a good exchange   you consent  
i hope you consent  

 it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to  if mr  and
mrs  weston do not   i think it admirable  and  as far as i can
answer for myself  shall be most happy  it seems the only improvement
that could be   papa  do you not think it an excellent improvement  

she was obliged to repeat and explain it  before it was fully
comprehended  and then  being quite new  farther representations
were necessary to make it acceptable 

 no  he thought it very far from an improvement  a very bad plan  
much worse than the other   a room at an inn was always damp
and dangerous  never properly aired  or fit to be inhabited 
if they must dance  they had better dance at randalls   he had never
been in the room at the crown in his life  did not know the people
who kept it by sight   oh  no  a very bad plan   they would catch
worse colds at the crown than anywhere  

 i was going to observe  sir   said frank churchill 
 that one of the great recommendations of this change would
be the very little danger of any body s catching cold  
so much less danger at the crown than at randalls   mr  perry
might have reason to regret the alteration  but nobody else could  

 sir   said mr  woodhouse  rather warmly   you are very much
mistaken if you suppose mr  perry to be that sort of character 
mr  perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill   but i
do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you
than your father s house  

 from the very circumstance of its being larger  sir   we shall have
no occasion to open the windows at all  not once the whole evening 
and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows  letting in cold
air upon heated bodies  which  as you well know  sir  does the mischief  

 open the windows   but surely  mr  churchill  nobody would think
of opening the windows at randalls   nobody could be so imprudent 
i never heard of such a thing   dancing with open windows   i am sure 
neither your father nor mrs  weston  poor miss taylor that was 
would suffer it  

 ah  sir  but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind
a window curtain  and throw up a sash  without its being suspected 
i have often known it done myself  

 have you indeed  sir   bless me   i never could have supposed it 
but i live out of the world  and am often astonished at what i hear 
however  this does make a difference  and  perhaps  when we come
to talk it over  but these sort of things require a good deal
of consideration   one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry 
if mr  and mrs  weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning 
we may talk it over  and see what can be done  

 but  unfortunately  sir  my time is so limited   

 oh   interrupted emma   there will be plenty of time for talking
every thing over   there is no hurry at all   if it can be contrived
to be at the crown  papa  it will be very convenient for the horses 
they will be so near their own stable  

 so they will  my dear   that is a great thing   not that james
ever complains  but it is right to spare our horses when we can 
if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired  but is
mrs  stokes to be trusted   i doubt it   i do not know her 
even by sight  

 i can answer for every thing of that nature  sir  because it will
be under mrs  weston s care   mrs  weston undertakes to direct
the whole  

 there  papa   now you must be satisfied  our own dear mrs  weston 
who is carefulness itself   do not you remember what mr  perry said 
so many years ago  when i had the measles    if  miss   taylor  undertakes
to wrap miss emma up  you need not have any fears  sir    how often
have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her  

 aye  very true   mr  perry did say so   i shall never forget it 
poor little emma   you were very bad with the measles  that is 
you would have been very bad  but for perry s great attention 
he came four times a day for a week   he said  from the first 
it was a very good sort  which was our great comfort  but the measles
are a dreadful complaint   i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones
have the measles  she will send for perry  

 my father and mrs  weston are at the crown at this moment  
said frank churchill   examining the capabilities of the house 
i left them there and came on to hartfield  impatient for your opinion 
and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice
on the spot   i was desired to say so from both   it would be the
greatest pleasure to them  if you could allow me to attend you there 
they can do nothing satisfactorily without you  

emma was most happy to be called to such a council  and her father 
engaging to think it all over while she was gone  the two young
people set off together without delay for the crown   there were
mr  and mrs  weston  delighted to see her and receive her approbation 
very busy and very happy in their different way  she  in some
little distress  and he  finding every thing perfect 

 emma   said she   this paper is worse than i expected 
look  in places you see it is dreadfully dirty  and the wainscot
is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined  

 my dear  you are too particular   said her husband    what does
all that signify   you will see nothing of it by candlelight 
it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight   we never see any
thing of it on our club nights  

the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant   men never
know when things are dirty or not   and the gentlemen perhaps
thought each to himself   women will have their little nonsenses
and needless cares  

one perplexity  however  arose  which the gentlemen did not disdain 
it regarded a supper room   at the time of the ballroom s being built 
suppers had not been in question  and a small card room adjoining 
was the only addition   what was to be done   this card room would
be wanted as a card room now  or  if cards were conveniently voted
unnecessary by their four selves  still was it not too small for
any comfortable supper   another room of much better size might be
secured for the purpose  but it was at the other end of the house 
and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it 
this made a difficulty   mrs  weston was afraid of draughts
for the young people in that passage  and neither emma nor the
gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded
at supper 

mrs  weston proposed having no regular supper  merely sandwiches 
 c   set out in the little room  but that was scouted as a
wretched suggestion   a private dance  without sitting down to supper 
was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women 
and mrs  weston must not speak of it again   she then took another
line of expediency  and looking into the doubtful room  observed 

 i do not think it  is  so very small   we shall not be many 
you know  

and mr  weston at the same time  walking briskly with long steps
through the passage  was calling out 

 you talk a great deal of the length of this passage  my dear 
it is a mere nothing after all  and not the least draught from
the stairs  

 i wish   said mrs  weston   one could know which arrangement our
guests in general would like best   to do what would be most generally
pleasing must be our object  if one could but tell what that would be  

 yes  very true   cried frank   very true   you want your neighbours 
opinions   i do not wonder at you   if one could ascertain what the
chief of them  the coles  for instance   they are not far off 
shall i call upon them   or miss bates   she is still nearer   
and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand
the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body   i think
we do want a larger council   suppose i go and invite miss bates
to join us  

 well  if you please   said mrs  weston rather hesitating   if you
think she will be of any use  

 you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates   said emma 
 she will be all delight and gratitude  but she will tell you nothing 
she will not even listen to your questions   i see no advantage in
consulting miss bates  

 but she is so amusing  so extremely amusing   i am very fond
of hearing miss bates talk   and i need not bring the whole family 
you know  

here mr  weston joined them  and on hearing what was proposed 
gave it his decided approbation 

 aye  do  frank   go and fetch miss bates  and let us end the matter
at once   she will enjoy the scheme  i am sure  and i do not know
a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties 
fetch miss bates   we are growing a little too nice   she is
a standing lesson of how to be happy   but fetch them both 
invite them both  

 both sir   can the old lady        

 the old lady   no  the young lady  to be sure   i shall think you
a great blockhead  frank  if you bring the aunt without the niece  

 oh   i beg your pardon  sir   i did not immediately recollect 
undoubtedly if you wish it  i will endeavour to persuade them both  
and away he ran 

long before he reappeared  attending the short  neat  brisk moving aunt 
and her elegant niece   mrs  weston  like a sweet tempered
woman and a good wife  had examined the passage again 
and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before  
indeed very trifling  and here ended the difficulties of decision 
all the rest  in speculation at least  was perfectly smooth 
all the minor arrangements of table and chair  lights and music 
tea and supper  made themselves  or were left as mere trifles
to be settled at any time between mrs  weston and mrs  stokes   
every body invited  was certainly to come  frank had already written
to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight 
which could not possibly be refused   and a delightful dance it was
to be 

most cordially  when miss bates arrived  did she agree that it must 
as a counsellor she was not wanted  but as an approver   a much
safer character   she was truly welcome   her approbation  at once
general and minute  warm and incessant  could not but please 
and for another half hour they were all walking to and fro 
between the different rooms  some suggesting  some attending 
and all in happy enjoyment of the future   the party did not break
up without emma s being positively secured for the two first dances
by the hero of the evening  nor without her overhearing mr  weston
whisper to his wife   he has asked her  my dear   that s right 
i knew he would  



chapter xii


one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball
completely satisfactory to emma  its being fixed for a day within
the granted term of frank churchill s stay in surry  for  in spite
of mr  weston s confidence  she could not think it so very impossible
that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain
a day beyond his fortnight   but this was not judged feasible 
the preparations must take their time  nothing could be properly
ready till the third week were entered on  and for a few days they
must be planning  proceeding and hoping in uncertainty  at the risk  
in her opinion  the great risk  of its being all in vain 

enscombe however was gracious  gracious in fact  if not in word 
his wish of staying longer evidently did not please  but it was
not opposed   all was safe and prosperous  and as the removal of one
solicitude generally makes way for another  emma  being now certain
of her ball  began to adopt as the next vexation mr  knightley s
provoking indifference about it   either because he did not
dance himself  or because the plan had been formed without his
being consulted  he seemed resolved that it should not interest him 
determined against its exciting any present curiosity  or affording
him any future amusement   to her voluntary communications emma
could get no more approving reply  than 

 very well   if the westons think it worth while to be at all this
trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment  i have nothing
to say against it  but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me   
oh  yes  i must be there  i could not refuse  and i will keep
as much awake as i can  but i would rather be at home  looking over
william larkins s week s account  much rather  i confess   
pleasure in seeing dancing   not i  indeed  i never look at it  
i do not know who does   fine dancing  i believe  like virtue 
must be its own reward   those who are standing by are usually
thinking of something very different  

this emma felt was aimed at her  and it made her quite angry 
it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was
so indifferent  or so indignant  he was not guided by  her  feelings
in reprobating the ball  for  she  enjoyed the thought of it
to an extraordinary degree   it made her animated  open hearted  
she voluntarily said   

 oh   miss woodhouse  i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball 
what a disappointment it would be   i do look forward to it  i own 
with  very  great pleasure  

it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have
preferred the society of william larkins   no   she was more and more
convinced that mrs  weston was quite mistaken in that surmise 
there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment
on his side  but no love 

alas  there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr  knightley 
two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the
over throw of every thing   a letter arrived from mr  churchill
to urge his nephew s instant return   mrs  churchill was unwell  
far too unwell to do without him  she had been in a very suffering
state  so said her husband  when writing to her nephew two days before 
though from her usual unwillingness to give pain  and constant
habit of never thinking of herself  she had not mentioned it 
but now she was too ill to trifle  and must entreat him to set off
for enscombe without delay 

the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma  in a note
from mrs  weston  instantly   as to his going  it was inevitable 
he must be gone within a few hours  though without feeling any real
alarm for his aunt  to lessen his repugnance   he knew her illnesses 
they never occurred but for her own convenience 

mrs  weston added   that he could only allow himself time to
hurry to highbury  after breakfast  and take leave of the few
friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him 
and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon  

this wretched note was the finale of emma s breakfast   when once
it had been read  there was no doing any thing  but lament
and exclaim   the loss of the ball  the loss of the young man  
and all that the young man might be feeling   it was too wretched   
such a delightful evening as it would have been   every body so happy 
and she and her partner the happiest    i said it would be so  
was the only consolation 

her father s feelings were quite distinct   he thought principally
of mrs  churchill s illness  and wanted to know how she was treated 
and as for the ball  it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed 
but they would all be safer at home 

emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared 
but if this reflected at all upon his impatience  his sorrowful
look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him 
he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it   his dejection
was most evident   he sat really lost in thought for the first
few minutes  and when rousing himself  it was only to say 

 of all horrid things  leave taking is the worst  

 but you will come again   said emma    this will not be your only
visit to randalls  

 ah    shaking his head   the uncertainty of when i may be able
to return   i shall try for it with a zeal   it will be the object
of all my thoughts and cares   and if my uncle and aunt go to town
this spring  but i am afraid  they did not stir last spring  
i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever  

 our poor ball must be quite given up  

 ah  that ball   why did we wait for any thing   why not seize the
pleasure at once   how often is happiness destroyed by preparation 
foolish preparation   you told us it would be so   oh   miss woodhouse 
why are you always so right  

 indeed  i am very sorry to be right in this instance   i would
much rather have been merry than wise  

 if i can come again  we are still to have our ball   my father
depends on it   do not forget your engagement  

emma looked graciously 

 such a fortnight as it has been   he continued   every day more
precious and more delightful than the day before   every day making
me less fit to bear any other place   happy those  who can remain
at highbury  

 as you do us such ample justice now   said emma  laughing   i will
venture to ask  whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first 
do not we rather surpass your expectations   i am sure we do 
i am sure you did not much expect to like us   you would not have been
so long in coming  if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury  

he laughed rather consciously  and though denying the sentiment 
emma was convinced that it had been so 

 and you must be off this very morning  

 yes  my father is to join me here   we shall walk back together 
and i must be off immediately   i am almost afraid that every moment
will bring him  

 not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and
miss bates   how unlucky   miss bates s powerful  argumentative mind
might have strengthened yours  

 yes  i  have  called there  passing the door  i thought it better 
it was a right thing to do   i went in for three minutes  and was
detained by miss bates s being absent   she was out  and i felt it
impossible not to wait till she came in   she is a woman that one may 
that one  must  laugh at  but that one would not wish to slight 
it was better to pay my visit  then   

he hesitated  got up  walked to a window 

 in short   said he   perhaps  miss woodhouse  i think you can
hardly be quite without suspicion   

he looked at her  as if wanting to read her thoughts   she hardly
knew what to say   it seemed like the forerunner of something
absolutely serious  which she did not wish   forcing herself
to speak  therefore  in the hope of putting it by  she calmly said 

 you are quite in the right  it was most natural to pay your visit  then   

he was silent   she believed he was looking at her  probably reflecting
on what she had said  and trying to understand the manner 
she heard him sigh   it was natural for him to feel that he had
 cause  to sigh   he could not believe her to be encouraging him 
a few awkward moments passed  and he sat down again  and in a more
determined manner said 

 it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be
given to hartfield   my regard for hartfield is most warm   

he stopt again  rose again  and seemed quite embarrassed   
he was more in love with her than emma had supposed  and who can say
how it might have ended  if his father had not made his appearance 
mr  woodhouse soon followed  and the necessity of exertion made
him composed 

a very few minutes more  however  completed the present trial 
mr  weston  always alert when business was to be done  and as
incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable 
as of foreseeing any that was doubtful  said   it was time to go  
and the young man  though he might and did sigh  could not but agree 
to take leave 

 i shall hear about you all   said he   that is my chief consolation 
i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you   i have
engaged mrs  weston to correspond with me   she has been so kind as
to promise it   oh  the blessing of a female correspondent  when one
is really interested in the absent   she will tell me every thing 
in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again  

a very friendly shake of the hand  a very earnest  good bye  
closed the speech  and the door had soon shut out frank churchill 
short had been the notice  short their meeting  he was gone  and emma
felt so sorry to part  and foresaw so great a loss to their little
society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry 
and feeling it too much 

it was a sad change   they had been meeting almost every day
since his arrival   certainly his being at randalls had given
great spirit to the last two weeks  indescribable spirit  the idea 
the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought 
the assurance of his attentions  his liveliness  his manners 
it had been a very happy fortnight  and forlorn must be the sinking
from it into the common course of hartfield days   to complete every
other recommendation  he had  almost  told her that he loved her 
what strength  or what constancy of affection he might be subject to 
was another point  but at present she could not doubt his having
a decidedly warm admiration  a conscious preference of herself 
and this persuasion  joined to all the rest  made her think that
she  must  be a little in love with him  in spite of every previous
determination against it 

 i certainly must   said she    this sensation of listlessness 
weariness  stupidity  this disinclination to sit down and employ myself 
this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house   
i must be in love  i should be the oddest creature in the world if i
were not  for a few weeks at least   well  evil to some is always
good to others   i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball 
if not for frank churchill  but mr  knightley will be happy 
he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes  

mr  knightley  however  shewed no triumphant happiness   he could
not say that he was sorry on his own account  his very cheerful look
would have contradicted him if he had  but he said  and very steadily 
that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others  and with
considerable kindness added 

 you  emma  who have so few opportunities of dancing  you are really
out of luck  you are very much out of luck  

it was some days before she saw jane fairfax  to judge of her
honest regret in this woeful change  but when they did meet 
her composure was odious   she had been particularly unwell  however 
suffering from headache to a degree  which made her aunt declare 
that had the ball taken place  she did not think jane could have
attended it  and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming
indifference to the languor of ill health 



chapter xiii


emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love   her ideas
only varied as to the how much   at first  she thought it was a good deal 
and afterwards  but little   she had great pleasure in hearing frank
churchill talked of  and  for his sake  greater pleasure than ever
in seeing mr  and mrs  weston  she was very often thinking of him 
and quite impatient for a letter  that she might know how he was 
how were his spirits  how was his aunt  and what was the chance
of his coming to randalls again this spring   but  on the other hand 
she could not admit herself to be unhappy  nor  after the
first morning  to be less disposed for employment than usual 
she was still busy and cheerful  and  pleasing as he was  she could
yet imagine him to have faults  and farther  though thinking of him
so much  and  as she sat drawing or working  forming a thousand
amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment 
fancying interesting dialogues  and inventing elegant letters 
the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she
 refused   him    their affection was always to subside into friendship 
every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting 
but still they were to part   when she became sensible of this 
it struck her that she could not be very much in love  for in spite
of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father 
never to marry  a strong attachment certainly must produce more
of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings 

 i do not find myself making any use of the word  sacrifice    said she   
 in not one of all my clever replies  my delicate negatives 
is there any allusion to making a sacrifice   i do suspect that he
is not really necessary to my happiness   so much the better 
i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do   i am
quite enough in love   i should be sorry to be more  

upon the whole  she was equally contented with her view of his feelings 

  he  is undoubtedly very much in love  every thing denotes it  very much
in love indeed   and when he comes again  if his affection continue 
i must be on my guard not to encourage it   it would be most
inexcusable to do otherwise  as my own mind is quite made up 
not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto 
no  if he had believed me at all to share his feelings  he would
not have been so wretched   could he have thought himself encouraged 
his looks and language at parting would have been different   
still  however  i must be on my guard   this is in the supposition
of his attachment continuing what it now is  but i do not know that i
expect it will  i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man  
i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy   
his feelings are warm  but i can imagine them rather changeable   
every consideration of the subject  in short  makes me thankful
that my happiness is not more deeply involved   i shall do very well
again after a little while  and then  it will be a good thing over 
for they say every body is in love once in their lives  and i shall
have been let off easily  

when his letter to mrs  weston arrived  emma had the perusal of it 
and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made
her at first shake her head over her own sensations  and think she
had undervalued their strength   it was a long  well written letter 
giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings 
expressing all the affection  gratitude  and respect which was
natural and honourable  and describing every thing exterior and local
that could be supposed attractive  with spirit and precision 
no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern  it was the
language of real feeling towards mrs  weston  and the transition
from highbury to enscombe  the contrast between the places in some
of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on
to shew how keenly it was felt  and how much more might have been
said but for the restraints of propriety   the charm of her own
name was not wanting    miss   woodhouse  appeared more than once 
and never without a something of pleasing connexion  either a
compliment to her taste  or a remembrance of what she had said 
and in the very last time of its meeting her eye  unadorned as it
was by any such broad wreath of gallantry  she yet could discern
the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment
perhaps of all conveyed   compressed into the very lowest vacant
corner were these words   i had not a spare moment on tuesday 
as you know  for miss woodhouse s beautiful little friend   pray make
my excuses and adieus to her    this  emma could not doubt  was all
for herself   harriet was remembered only from being  her  friend 
his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor
better than had been anticipated  mrs  churchill was recovering 
and he dared not yet  even in his own imagination  fix a time for
coming to randalls again 

gratifying  however  and stimulative as was the letter in the
material part  its sentiments  she yet found  when it was folded up
and returned to mrs  weston  that it had not added any lasting warmth 
that she could still do without the writer  and that he must learn
to do without her   her intentions were unchanged   her resolution
of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for
his subsequent consolation and happiness   his recollection of harriet 
and the words which clothed it  the  beautiful little friend  
suggested to her the idea of harriet s succeeding her in his affections 
was it impossible   no   harriet undoubtedly was greatly his
inferior in understanding  but he had been very much struck with
the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner 
and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in
her favour   for harriet  it would be advantageous and delightful indeed 

 i must not dwell upon it   said she    i must not think of it 
i know the danger of indulging such speculations   but stranger
things have happened  and when we cease to care for each other
as we do now  it will be the means of confirming us in that sort
of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward
to with pleasure  

it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet s behalf 
though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom  for evil
in that quarter was at hand   as frank churchill s arrival had
succeeded mr  elton s engagement in the conversation of highbury 
as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first  so now
upon frank churchill s disappearance  mr  elton s concerns were
assuming the most irresistible form   his wedding day was named 
he would soon be among them again  mr  elton and his bride 
there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe
before  mr  elton and his bride  was in every body s mouth 
and frank churchill was forgotten   emma grew sick at the sound 
she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr  elton 
and harriet s mind  she had been willing to hope  had been lately
gaining strength   with mr  weston s ball in view at least 
there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things 
but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state
of composure as could stand against the actual approach  new carriage 
bell ringing  and all 

poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the
reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma
could give   emma felt that she could not do too much for her 
that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience 
but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing
any effect  for ever agreed to  without being able to make their opinions
the same   harriet listened submissively  and said  it was very true  
it was just as miss woodhouse described  it was not worth while to
think about them  and she would not think about them any longer 
but no change of subject could avail  and the next half hour
saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before 
at last emma attacked her on another ground 

 your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about
mr  elton s marrying  harriet  is the strongest reproach you can
make  me    you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i
fell into   it was all my doing  i know   i have not forgotten it 
i assure you   deceived myself  i did very miserably deceive you  
and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever   do not imagine
me in danger of forgetting it  

harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words
of eager exclamation   emma continued 

 i have not said  exert yourself harriet for my sake  think less 
talk less of mr  elton for my sake  because for your own sake rather 
i would wish it to be done  for the sake of what is more important
than my comfort  a habit of self command in you  a consideration
of what is your duty  an attention to propriety  an endeavour
to avoid the suspicions of others  to save your health and credit 
and restore your tranquillity   these are the motives which i
have been pressing on you   they are very important  and sorry
i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them 
my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration   i want
you to save yourself from greater pain   perhaps i may sometimes
have felt that harriet would not forget what was due  or rather
what would be kind by me  

this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest 
the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse 
whom she really loved extremely  made her wretched for a while 
and when the violence of grief was comforted away  still remained
powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it
very tolerably 

 you  who have been the best friend i ever had in my life  
want gratitude to you   nobody is equal to you   i care for nobody
as i do for you   oh   miss woodhouse  how ungrateful i have been  

such expressions  assisted as they were by every thing that look
and manner could do  made emma feel that she had never loved harriet
so well  nor valued her affection so highly before 

 there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart   said she
afterwards to herself    there is nothing to be compared to it 
warmth and tenderness of heart  with an affectionate  open manner 
will beat all the clearness of head in the world  for attraction 
i am sure it will   it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear
father so generally beloved  which gives isabella all her popularity   
i have it not  but i know how to prize and respect it   harriet is
my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives 
dear harriet   i would not change you for the clearest headed 
longest sighted  best judging female breathing   oh  the coldness
of a jane fairfax   harriet is worth a hundred such  and for a wife  
a sensible man s wife  it is invaluable   i mention no names 
but happy the man who changes emma for harriet  



chapter xiv


mrs  elton was first seen at church   but though devotion might
be interrupted  curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew 
and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid 
to settle whether she were very pretty indeed  or only rather pretty 
or not pretty at all 

emma had feelings  less of curiosity than of pride or propriety 
to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects 
and she made a point of harriet s going with her  that the worst of
the business might be gone through as soon as possible 

she could not enter the house again  could not be in the same room
to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago 
to lace up her boot  without  recollecting    a thousand vexatious
thoughts would recur   compliments  charades  and horrible blunders 
and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be
recollecting too  but she behaved very well  and was only rather
pale and silent   the visit was of course short  and there was so
much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it  that emma
would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady 
and on no account to give one  beyond the nothing meaning terms
of being  elegantly dressed  and very pleasing  

she did not really like her   she would not be in a hurry to find fault 
but she suspected that there was no elegance   ease  but not elegance   
she was almost sure that for a young woman  a stranger  a bride 
there was too much ease   her person was rather good  her face
not unpretty  but neither feature  nor air  nor voice  nor manner 
were elegant   emma thought at least it would turn out so 

as for mr  elton  his manners did not appear  but no  she would
not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners 
it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits 
and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it 
the woman was better off  she might have the assistance of fine clothes 
and the privilege of bashfulness  but the man had only his own
good sense to depend on  and when she considered how peculiarly
unlucky poor mr  elton was in being in the same room at once with
the woman he had just married  the woman he had wanted to marry 
and the woman whom he had been expected to marry  she must allow him
to have the right to look as little wise  and to be as much affectedly 
and as little really easy as could be 

 well  miss woodhouse   said harriet  when they had quitted
the house  and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin 
 well  miss woodhouse   with a gentle sigh   what do you think of her   
is not she very charming  

there was a little hesitation in emma s answer 

 oh  yes  very  a very pleasing young woman  

 i think her beautiful  quite beautiful  

 very nicely dressed  indeed  a remarkably elegant gown  

 i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love  

 oh  no  there is nothing to surprize one at all   a pretty fortune 
and she came in his way  

 i dare say   returned harriet  sighing again   i dare say she
was very much attached to him  

 perhaps she might  but it is not every man s fate to marry the
woman who loves him best   miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home 
and thought this the best offer she was likely to have  

 yes   said harriet earnestly   and well she might  nobody could ever
have a better   well  i wish them happy with all my heart   and now 
miss woodhouse  i do not think i shall mind seeing them again 
he is just as superior as ever   but being married  you know 
it is quite a different thing   no  indeed  miss woodhouse  you need
not be afraid  i can sit and admire him now without any great misery 
to know that he has not thrown himself away  is such a comfort   
she does seem a charming young woman  just what he deserves 
happy creature   he called her  augusta    how delightful  

when the visit was returned  emma made up her mind   she could then
see more and judge better   from harriet s happening not to be
at hartfield  and her father s being present to engage mr  elton 
she had a quarter of an hour of the lady s conversation to herself 
and could composedly attend to her  and the quarter of an hour quite
convinced her that mrs  elton was a vain woman  extremely well
satisfied with herself  and thinking much of her own importance 
that she meant to shine and be very superior  but with manners which
had been formed in a bad school  pert and familiar  that all her
notions were drawn from one set of people  and one style of living 
that if not foolish she was ignorant  and that her society would
certainly do mr  elton no good 

harriet would have been a better match   if not wise or refined herself 
she would have connected him with those who were  but miss hawkins 
it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit  had been the best
of her own set   the rich brother in law near bristol was the pride
of the alliance  and his place and his carriages were the pride
of him 

the very first subject after being seated was maple grove   my brother
mr  suckling s seat    a comparison of hartfield to maple grove 
the grounds of hartfield were small  but neat and pretty  and the
house was modern and well built  mrs  elton seemed most favourably
impressed by the size of the room  the entrance  and all that she
could see or imagine    very like maple grove indeed   she was quite
struck by the likeness   that room was the very shape and size
of the morning room at maple grove  her sister s favourite room    
mr  elton was appealed to    was not it astonishingly like   
she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove  

 and the staircase  you know  as i came in  i observed how very like
the staircase was  placed exactly in the same part of the house 
i really could not help exclaiming   i assure you  miss woodhouse 
it is very delightful to me  to be reminded of a place i am so
extremely partial to as maple grove   i have spent so many happy
months there   with a little sigh of sentiment   a charming place 
undoubtedly   every body who sees it is struck by its beauty 
but to me  it has been quite a home   whenever you are transplanted 
like me  miss woodhouse  you will understand how very delightful it
is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind 
i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony  

emma made as slight a reply as she could  but it was fully sufficient
for mrs  elton  who only wanted to be talking herself 

 so extremely like maple grove   and it is not merely the house  
the grounds  i assure you  as far as i could observe  are strikingly
like   the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here 
and stand very much in the same way  just across the lawn 
and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree  with a bench round it 
which put me so exactly in mind   my brother and sister will be
enchanted with this place   people who have extensive grounds
themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style  

emma doubted the truth of this sentiment   she had a great idea
that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little
for the extensive grounds of any body else  but it was not worth
while to attack an error so double dyed  and therefore only said
in reply 

 when you have seen more of this country  i am afraid you will think
you have overrated hartfield   surry is full of beauties  

 oh  yes  i am quite aware of that   it is the garden of england 
you know   surry is the garden of england  

 yes  but we must not rest our claims on that distinction 
many counties  i believe  are called the garden of england 
as well as surry  

 no  i fancy not   replied mrs  elton  with a most satisfied smile  
i never heard any county but surry called so  

emma was silenced 

 my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring 
or summer at farthest   continued mrs  elton   and that will be
our time for exploring   while they are with us  we shall explore
a great deal  i dare say   they will have their barouche landau 
of course  which holds four perfectly  and therefore  without saying
any thing of  our  carriage  we should be able to explore the different
beauties extremely well   they would hardly come in their chaise 
i think  at that season of the year   indeed  when the time draws on 
i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau 
it will be so very much preferable   when people come into a beautiful
country of this sort  you know  miss woodhouse  one naturally wishes
them to see as much as possible  and mr  suckling is extremely fond
of exploring   we explored to king s weston twice last summer 
in that way  most delightfully  just after their first having the
barouche landau   you have many parties of that kind here  i suppose 
miss woodhouse  every summer  

 no  not immediately here   we are rather out of distance of the very
striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of 
and we are a very quiet set of people  i believe  more disposed
to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure  

 ah  there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort 
nobody can be more devoted to home than i am   i was quite
a proverb for it at maple grove   many a time has selina said 
when she has been going to bristol   i really cannot get this girl
to move from the house   i absolutely must go in by myself  though i
hate being stuck up in the barouche landau without a companion 
but augusta  i believe  with her own good will  would never stir
beyond the park paling    many a time has she said so  and yet i
am no advocate for entire seclusion   i think  on the contrary 
when people shut themselves up entirely from society  it is a very
bad thing  and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in
a proper degree  without living in it either too much or too little 
i perfectly understand your situation  however  miss woodhouse  
 looking towards mr  woodhouse   your father s state of health must
be a great drawback   why does not he try bath   indeed he should 
let me recommend bath to you   i assure you i have no doubt of its doing
mr  woodhouse good  

 my father tried it more than once  formerly  but without receiving
any benefit  and mr  perry  whose name  i dare say  is not unknown
to you  does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be
useful now  

 ah  that s a great pity  for i assure you  miss woodhouse 
where the waters do agree  it is quite wonderful the relief
they give   in my bath life  i have seen such instances of it 
and it is so cheerful a place  that it could not fail of being of
use to mr  woodhouse s spirits  which  i understand  are sometimes
much depressed   and as to its recommendations to  you   i fancy i
need not take much pains to dwell on them   the advantages of bath
to the young are pretty generally understood   it would be a charming
introduction for you  who have lived so secluded a life  and i could
immediately secure you some of the best society in the place 
a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance  and my
particular friend  mrs  partridge  the lady i have always resided
with when in bath  would be most happy to shew you any attentions 
and would be the very person for you to go into public with  

it was as much as emma could bear  without being impolite 
the idea of her being indebted to mrs  elton for what was called
an  introduction   of her going into public under the auspices
of a friend of mrs  elton s  probably some vulgar  dashing widow 
who  with the help of a boarder  just made a shift to live   
the dignity of miss woodhouse  of hartfield  was sunk indeed 

she restrained herself  however  from any of the reproofs she could
have given  and only thanked mrs  elton coolly   but their going
to bath was quite out of the question  and she was not perfectly
convinced that the place might suit her better than her father  
and then  to prevent farther outrage and indignation  changed the
subject directly 

 i do not ask whether you are musical  mrs  elton   upon these occasions 
a lady s character generally precedes her  and highbury has long
known that you are a superior performer  

 oh  no  indeed  i must protest against any such idea 
a superior performer   very far from it  i assure you 
consider from how partial a quarter your information came 
i am doatingly fond of music  passionately fond   and my friends
say i am not entirely devoid of taste  but as to any thing else 
upon my honour my performance is  mediocre  to the last degree 
you  miss woodhouse  i well know  play delightfully   i assure you
it has been the greatest satisfaction  comfort  and delight to me 
to hear what a musical society i am got into   i absolutely cannot
do without music   it is a necessary of life to me  and having always
been used to a very musical society  both at maple grove and in bath 
it would have been a most serious sacrifice   i honestly said as much
to mr  e  when he was speaking of my future home  and expressing
his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable 
and the inferiority of the house too  knowing what i had been
accustomed to  of course he was not wholly without apprehension 
when he was speaking of it in that way  i honestly said that  the 
 world  i could give up  parties  balls  plays  for i had no fear
of retirement   blessed with so many resources within myself 
the world was not necessary to  me    i could do very well without it 
to those who had no resources it was a different thing  but my
resources made me quite independent   and as to smaller sized rooms
than i had been used to  i really could not give it a thought 
i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description 
certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove  but i
did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness 
nor were spacious apartments    but   said i   to be quite honest 
i do not think i can live without something of a musical society 
i condition for nothing else  but without music  life would be a blank
to me   

 we cannot suppose   said emma  smiling   that mr  elton would hesitate
to assure you of there being a  very  musical society in highbury 
and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than
may be pardoned  in consideration of the motive  

 no  indeed  i have no doubts at all on that head   i am delighted
to find myself in such a circle   i hope we shall have many sweet
little concerts together   i think  miss woodhouse  you and i
must establish a musical club  and have regular weekly meetings
at your house  or ours   will not it be a good plan   if  we 
exert ourselves  i think we shall not be long in want of allies 
something of that nature would be particularly desirable for  me  
as an inducement to keep me in practice  for married women  you know  
there is a sad story against them  in general   they are but too apt
to give up music  

 but you  who are so extremely fond of it  there can
be no danger  surely  

 i should hope not  but really when i look around among my acquaintance 
i tremble   selina has entirely given up music  never touches
the instrument  though she played sweetly   and the same may be said
of mrs  jeffereys  clara partridge  that was  and of the two milmans 
now mrs  bird and mrs  james cooper  and of more than i can enumerate 
upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright   i used to be
quite angry with selina  but really i begin now to comprehend
that a married woman has many things to call her attention 
i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper  

 but every thing of that kind   said emma   will soon
be in so regular a train   

 well   said mrs  elton  laughing   we shall see  

emma  finding her so determined upon neglecting her music 
had nothing more to say  and  after a moment s pause  mrs  elton
chose another subject 

 we have been calling at randalls   said she   and found them
both at home  and very pleasant people they seem to be 
i like them extremely   mr  weston seems an excellent creature  
quite a first rate favourite with me already  i assure you 
and  she  appears so truly good  there is something so motherly
and kind hearted about her  that it wins upon one directly 
she was your governess  i think  

emma was almost too much astonished to answer  but mrs  elton
hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on 

 having understood as much  i was rather astonished to find her
so very lady like   but she is really quite the gentlewoman  

 mrs  weston s manners   said emma   were always particularly good 
their propriety  simplicity  and elegance  would make them the safest
model for any young woman  

 and who do you think came in while we were there  

emma was quite at a loss   the tone implied some old acquaintance  
and how could she possibly guess 

 knightley   continued mrs  elton   knightley himself   was not
it lucky   for  not being within when he called the other day 
i had never seen him before  and of course  as so particular a
friend of mr  e  s  i had a great curiosity    my friend knightley 
had been so often mentioned  that i was really impatient to see him 
and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not
be ashamed of his friend   knightley is quite the gentleman 
i like him very much   decidedly  i think  a very gentleman like man  

happily  it was now time to be gone   they were off  and emma
could breathe 

 insufferable woman   was her immediate exclamation    worse than i
had supposed   absolutely insufferable   knightley   i could not
have believed it   knightley   never seen him in her life before 
and call him knightley   and discover that he is a gentleman 
a little upstart  vulgar being  with her mr  e   and her  caro   sposo  
and her resources  and all her airs of pert pretension and
underbred finery   actually to discover that mr  knightley is
a gentleman   i doubt whether he will return the compliment 
and discover her to be a lady   i could not have believed it 
and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club 
one would fancy we were bosom friends   and mrs  weston   
astonished that the person who had brought me up should be
a gentlewoman   worse and worse   i never met with her equal 
much beyond my hopes   harriet is disgraced by any comparison 
oh  what would frank churchill say to her  if he were here 
how angry and how diverted he would be   ah  there i am  
thinking of him directly   always the first person to be thought of 
how i catch myself out   frank churchill comes as regularly into
my mind    

all this ran so glibly through her thoughts  that by the time
her father had arranged himself  after the bustle of the eltons 
departure  and was ready to speak  she was very tolerably capable
of attending 

 well  my dear   he deliberately began   considering we never saw
her before  she seems a very pretty sort of young lady  and i dare say
she was very much pleased with you   she speaks a little too quick 
a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear 
but i believe i am nice  i do not like strange voices  and nobody speaks
like you and poor miss taylor   however  she seems a very obliging 
pretty behaved young lady  and no doubt will make him a very good wife 
though i think he had better not have married   i made the best
excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs  elton
on this happy occasion  i said that i hoped i  should  in the course
of the summer   but i ought to have gone before   not to wait upon
a bride is very remiss   ah  it shews what a sad invalid i am 
but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane  

 i dare say your apologies were accepted  sir   mr  elton knows you  

 yes   but a young lady  a bride  i ought to have paid my respects
to her if possible   it was being very deficient  

 but  my dear papa  you are no friend to matrimony  and therefore
why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a  bride  
it ought to be no recommendation to  you    it is encouraging people
to marry if you make so much of them  

 no  my dear  i never encouraged any body to marry  but i would
always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady  and a bride 
especially  is never to be neglected   more is avowedly due to  her  
a bride  you know  my dear  is always the first in company 
let the others be who they may  

 well  papa  if this is not encouragement to marry  i do not know
what is   and i should never have expected you to be lending your
sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies  

 my dear  you do not understand me   this is a
matter of mere common politeness and good breeding 
and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry  

emma had done   her father was growing nervous  and could not
understand  her    her mind returned to mrs  elton s offences 
and long  very long  did they occupy her 



chapter xv


emma was not required  by any subsequent discovery  to retract her ill
opinion of mrs  elton   her observation had been pretty correct 
such as mrs  elton appeared to her on this second interview 
such she appeared whenever they met again   self important  presuming 
familiar  ignorant  and ill bred  she had a little beauty and a
little accomplishment  but so little judgment that she thought herself
coming with superior knowledge of the world  to enliven and improve
a country neighbourhood  and conceived miss hawkins to have held
such a place in society as mrs  elton s consequence only could surpass 

there was no reason to suppose mr  elton thought at all differently
from his wife   he seemed not merely happy with her  but proud 
he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such
a woman to highbury  as not even miss woodhouse could equal 
and the greater part of her new acquaintance  disposed to commend 
or not in the habit of judging  following the lead of miss bates s
good will  or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever
and as agreeable as she professed herself  were very well satisfied 
so that mrs  elton s praise passed from one mouth to another as it
ought to do  unimpeded by miss woodhouse  who readily continued her
first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being  very
pleasant and very elegantly dressed  

in one respect mrs  elton grew even worse than she had appeared
at first   her feelings altered towards emma   offended  probably 
by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with 
she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold
and distant  and though the effect was agreeable  the ill will
which produced it was necessarily increasing emma s dislike 
her manners  too  and mr  elton s  were unpleasant towards harriet 
they were sneering and negligent   emma hoped it must rapidly work
harriet s cure  but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour
sunk them both very much   it was not to be doubted that poor
harriet s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve 
and her own share in the story  under a colouring the least favourable
to her and the most soothing to him  had in all likelihood been
given also   she was  of course  the object of their joint dislike   
when they had nothing else to say  it must be always easy to begin
abusing miss woodhouse  and the enmity which they dared not shew
in open disrespect to her  found a broader vent in contemptuous
treatment of harriet 

mrs  elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax  and from the first 
not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be
supposed to recommend the other  but from the very first  and she
was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration  
but without solicitation  or plea  or privilege  she must be wanting
to assist and befriend her   before emma had forfeited her confidence 
and about the third time of their meeting  she heard all mrs  elton s
knight errantry on the subject   

 jane fairfax is absolutely charming  miss woodhouse   i quite
rave about jane fairfax   a sweet  interesting creature   so mild
and ladylike  and with such talents   i assure you i think she
has very extraordinary talents   i do not scruple to say that she
plays extremely well   i know enough of music to speak decidedly
on that point   oh  she is absolutely charming   you will laugh at
my warmth  but  upon my word  i talk of nothing but jane fairfax   
and her situation is so calculated to affect one   miss woodhouse 
we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her 
we must bring her forward   such talent as hers must not be suffered
to remain unknown   i dare say you have heard those charming lines of
the poet 

         full many a flower is born to blush unseen 
           and waste its fragrance on the desert air  

we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax  

 i cannot think there is any danger of it   was emma s calm answer  
 and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax s situation
and understand what her home has been  with colonel and mrs  campbell 
i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown  

 oh  but dear miss woodhouse  she is now in such retirement 
such obscurity  so thrown away   whatever advantages she may have
enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end   and i think
she feels it   i am sure she does   she is very timid and silent 
one can see that she feels the want of encouragement   i like her
the better for it   i must confess it is a recommendation to me 
i am a great advocate for timidity  and i am sure one does
not often meet with it   but in those who are at all inferior 
it is extremely prepossessing   oh   i assure you  jane fairfax
is a very delightful character  and interests me more than i
can express  

 you appear to feel a great deal  but i am not aware how you or any
of miss fairfax s acquaintance here  any of those who have known
her longer than yourself  can shew her any other attention than   

 my dear miss woodhouse  a vast deal may be done by those who dare
to act   you and i need not be afraid   if  we  set the example 
many will follow it as far as they can  though all have not
our situations    we  have carriages to fetch and convey her home 
and  we  live in a style which could not make the addition of
jane fairfax  at any time  the least inconvenient   i should be
extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner 
as could make me regret having asked  more  than jane fairfax
to partake of it   i have no idea of that sort of thing   it is
not likely that i  should   considering what i have been used to 
my greatest danger  perhaps  in housekeeping  may be quite the
other way  in doing too much  and being too careless of expense 
maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be  
for we do not at all affect to equal my brother  mr  suckling 
in income   however  my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax   
i shall certainly have her very often at my house  shall introduce
her wherever i can  shall have musical parties to draw out her talents 
and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation 
my acquaintance is so very extensive  that i have little doubt
of hearing of something to suit her shortly   i shall introduce her 
of course  very particularly to my brother and sister when they come
to us   i am sure they will like her extremely  and when she gets
a little acquainted with them  her fears will completely wear off 
for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is
highly conciliating   i shall have her very often indeed while they
are with me  and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in
the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties  

 poor jane fairfax    thought emma    you have not deserved this 
you may have done wrong with regard to mr  dixon  but this is a
punishment beyond what you can have merited   the kindness and protection
of mrs  elton    jane fairfax and jane fairfax    heavens   let me
not suppose that she dares go about  emma woodhouse ing me   
but upon my honour  there seems no limits to the licentiousness
of that woman s tongue  

emma had not to listen to such paradings again  to any so exclusively
addressed to herself  so disgustingly decorated with a  dear miss
woodhouse    the change on mrs  elton s side soon afterwards appeared 
and she was left in peace  neither forced to be the very particular
friend of mrs  elton  nor  under mrs  elton s guidance  the very
active patroness of jane fairfax  and only sharing with others in a
general way  in knowing what was felt  what was meditated  what was done 

she looked on with some amusement   miss bates s gratitude for
mrs  elton s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless
simplicity and warmth   she was quite one of her worthies  
the most amiable  affable  delightful woman  just as accomplished
and condescending as mrs  elton meant to be considered 
emma s only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept
those attentions and tolerate mrs  elton as she seemed to do 
she heard of her walking with the eltons  sitting with the eltons 
spending a day with the eltons   this was astonishing   she could not
have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax
could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer 

 she is a riddle  quite a riddle   said she    to chuse to remain
here month after month  under privations of every sort   and now
to chuse the mortification of mrs  elton s notice and the penury
of her conversation  rather than return to the superior companions
who have always loved her with such real  generous affection  

jane had come to highbury professedly for three months  the campbells
were gone to ireland for three months  but now the campbells
had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer 
and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there 
according to miss bates  it all came from her  mrs  dixon had
written most pressingly   would jane but go  means were to be found 
servants sent  friends contrived  no travelling difficulty allowed
to exist  but still she had declined it 

 she must have some motive  more powerful than appears  for refusing
this invitation   was emma s conclusion    she must be under some
sort of penance  inflicted either by the campbells or herself 
there is great fear  great caution  great resolution somewhere   
she is  not  to be with the  dixons    the decree is issued by somebody 
but why must she consent to be with the eltons   here is quite a
separate puzzle  

upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject 
before the few who knew her opinion of mrs  elton  mrs  weston
ventured this apology for jane 

 we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage 
my dear emma  but it is better than being always at home 
her aunt is a good creature  but  as a constant companion 
must be very tiresome   we must consider what miss fairfax quits 
before we condemn her taste for what she goes to  

 you are right  mrs  weston   said mr  knightley warmly   miss fairfax
is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs  elton 
could she have chosen with whom to associate  she would not have
chosen her   but  with a reproachful smile at emma  she receives
attentions from mrs  elton  which nobody else pays her  

emma felt that mrs  weston was giving her a momentary glance 
and she was herself struck by his warmth   with a faint blush 
she presently replied 

 such attentions as mrs  elton s  i should have imagined 
would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax   mrs  elton s
invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting  

 i should not wonder   said mrs  weston   if miss fairfax were to have
been drawn on beyond her own inclination  by her aunt s eagerness
in accepting mrs  elton s civilities for her   poor miss bates may
very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater
appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated 
in spite of the very natural wish of a little change  

both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again  and after a few
minutes silence  he said 

 another thing must be taken into consideration too  mrs  elton
does not talk  to  miss fairfax as she speaks  of  her   we all know
the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou  the plainest
spoken amongst us  we all feel the influence of a something beyond
common civility in our personal intercourse with each other  
a something more early implanted   we cannot give any body the
disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before 
we feel things differently   and besides the operation of this 
as a general principle  you may be sure that miss fairfax awes
mrs  elton by her superiority both of mind and manner  and that 
face to face  mrs  elton treats her with all the respect which she
has a claim to   such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell
in mrs  elton s way before  and no degree of vanity can prevent
her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action  if not
in consciousness  

 i know how highly you think of jane fairfax   said emma 
little henry was in her thoughts  and a mixture of alarm and delicacy
made her irresolute what else to say 

 yes   he replied   any body may know how highly i think of her  

 and yet   said emma  beginning hastily and with an arch look 
but soon stopping  it was better  however  to know the worst at once  
she hurried on   and yet  perhaps  you may hardly be aware yourself
how highly it is   the extent of your admiration may take you by
surprize some day or other  

mr  knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick
leather gaiters  and either the exertion of getting them together 
or some other cause  brought the colour into his face  as he answered 

 oh  are you there   but you are miserably behindhand   mr  cole
gave me a hint of it six weeks ago  

he stopped   emma felt her foot pressed by mrs  weston  and did
not herself know what to think   in a moment he went on  

 that will never be  however  i can assure you   miss fairfax 
i dare say  would not have me if i were to ask her  and i am very
sure i shall never ask her  

emma returned her friend s pressure with interest  and was pleased
enough to exclaim 

 you are not vain  mr  knightley   i will say that for you  

he seemed hardly to hear her  he was thoughtful  and in a manner
which shewed him not pleased  soon afterwards said 

 so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax  

 no indeed i have not   you have scolded me too much for match making 
for me to presume to take such a liberty with you   what i said
just now  meant nothing   one says those sort of things  of course 
without any idea of a serious meaning   oh  no  upon my word i have not
the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body 
you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way 
if you were married  

mr  knightley was thoughtful again   the result of his reverie was 
 no  emma  i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will
ever take me by surprize   i never had a thought of her in that way 
i assure you    and soon afterwards   jane fairfax is a very charming
young woman  but not even jane fairfax is perfect   she has a fault 
she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife  

emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault 
 well   said she   and you soon silenced mr  cole  i suppose  

 yes  very soon   he gave me a quiet hint  i told him he was mistaken 
he asked my pardon and said no more   cole does not want to be wiser
or wittier than his neighbours  

 in that respect how unlike dear mrs  elton  who wants to be wiser
and wittier than all the world   i wonder how she speaks of the coles  
what she calls them   how can she find any appellation for them 
deep enough in familiar vulgarity   she calls you  knightley  what can
she do for mr  cole   and so i am not to be surprized that jane
fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her 
mrs  weston  your argument weighs most with me   i can much more
readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates 
than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over
mrs  elton   i have no faith in mrs  elton s acknowledging herself
the inferior in thought  word  or deed  or in her being under any
restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding  i cannot
imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor
with praise  encouragement  and offers of service  that she will not be
continually detailing her magnificent intentions  from the procuring
her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful
exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau  

 jane fairfax has feeling   said mr  knightley   i do not
accuse her of want of feeling   her sensibilities  i suspect 
are strong  and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance 
patience  self controul  but it wants openness   she is reserved 
more reserved  i think  than she used to be  and i love an
open temper   no  till cole alluded to my supposed attachment 
it had never entered my head   i saw jane fairfax and conversed with
her  with admiration and pleasure always  but with no thought beyond  

 well  mrs  weston   said emma triumphantly when he left them 
 what do you say now to mr  knightley s marrying jane fairfax  

 why  really  dear emma  i say that he is so very much occupied
by the idea of  not  being in love with her  that i should not wonder
if it were to end in his being so at last   do not beat me  



chapter xvi


every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr  elton 
was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage   dinner parties and
evening parties were made for him and his lady  and invitations
flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending
they were never to have a disengaged day 

 i see how it is   said she    i see what a life i am to lead
among you   upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated 
we really seem quite the fashion   if this is living in the country 
it is nothing very formidable   from monday next to saturday 
i assure you we have not a disengaged day   a woman with fewer
resources than i have  need not have been at a loss  

no invitation came amiss to her   her bath habits made evening parties
perfectly natural to her  and maple grove had given her a taste
for dinners   she was a little shocked at the want of two
drawing rooms  at the poor attempt at rout cakes  and there being
no ice in the highbury card parties  mrs  bates  mrs  perry 
mrs  goddard and others  were a good deal behind hand in knowledge
of the world  but she would soon shew them how every thing ought
to be arranged   in the course of the spring she must return their
civilities by one very superior party  in which her card tables
should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs
in the true style  and more waiters engaged for the evening
than their own establishment could furnish  to carry round
the refreshments at exactly the proper hour  and in the proper order 

emma  in the meanwhile  could not be satisfied without a dinner
at hartfield for the eltons   they must not do less than others 
or she should be exposed to odious suspicions  and imagined capable
of pitiful resentment   a dinner there must be   after emma had
talked about it for ten minutes  mr  woodhouse felt no unwillingness 
and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom
of the table himself  with the usual regular difficulty of deciding
who should do it for him 

the persons to be invited  required little thought   besides the eltons 
it must be the westons and mr  knightley  so far it was all of course  
and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must
be asked to make the eighth   but this invitation was not given
with equal satisfaction  and on many accounts emma was particularly
pleased by harriet s begging to be allowed to decline it 
 she would rather not be in his company more than she could help 
she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy
wife together  without feeling uncomfortable   if miss woodhouse
would not be displeased  she would rather stay at home  
it was precisely what emma would have wished  had she deemed it
possible enough for wishing   she was delighted with the fortitude
of her little friend  for fortitude she knew it was in her to give
up being in company and stay at home  and she could now invite the
very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth  jane fairfax   
since her last conversation with mrs  weston and mr  knightley 
she was more conscience stricken about jane fairfax than she had
often been   mr  knightley s words dwelt with her   he had said
that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs  elton which nobody
else paid her 

 this is very true   said she   at least as far as relates to me 
which was all that was meant  and it is very shameful   of the same age  
and always knowing her  i ought to have been more her friend   
she will never like me now   i have neglected her too long   but i
will shew her greater attention than i have done  

every invitation was successful   they were all disengaged and all happy   
the preparatory interest of this dinner  however  was not yet over 
a circumstance rather unlucky occurred   the two eldest little
knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of
some weeks in the spring  and their papa now proposed bringing them 
and staying one whole day at hartfield  which one day would be
the very day of this party   his professional engagements did
not allow of his being put off  but both father and daughter were
disturbed by its happening so   mr  woodhouse considered eight
persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear  
and here would be a ninth  and emma apprehended that it would
be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even
to hartfield for forty eight hours without falling in with a dinner party 

she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself 
by representing that though he certainly would make them nine 
yet he always said so little  that the increase of noise would be
very immaterial   she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself 
to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed
to her instead of his brother 

the event was more favourable to mr  woodhouse than to emma 
john knightley came  but mr  weston was unexpectedly summoned to town
and must be absent on the very day   he might be able to join them
in the evening  but certainly not to dinner   mr  woodhouse was quite
at ease  and the seeing him so  with the arrival of the little boys
and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate 
removed the chief of even emma s vexation 

the day came  the party were punctually assembled  and mr  john knightley
seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable 
instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited
for dinner  he was talking to miss fairfax   mrs  elton  as elegant
as lace and pearls could make her  he looked at in silence  
wanting only to observe enough for isabella s information  but miss
fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl  and he could
talk to her   he had met her before breakfast as he was returning
from a walk with his little boys  when it had been just beginning
to rain   it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject 
and he said 

 i hope you did not venture far  miss fairfax  this morning  or i
am sure you must have been wet   we scarcely got home in time 
i hope you turned directly  

 i went only to the post office   said she   and reached home
before the rain was much   it is my daily errand   i always fetch
the letters when i am here   it saves trouble  and is a something
to get me out   a walk before breakfast does me good  

 not a walk in the rain  i should imagine  

 no  but it did not absolutely rain when i set out  

mr  john knightley smiled  and replied 

 that is to say  you chose to have your walk  for you were not six
yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you 
and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before 
the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives 
when you have lived to my age  you will begin to think letters are
never worth going through the rain for  

there was a little blush  and then this answer 

 i must not hope to be ever situated as you are  in the midst of
every dearest connexion  and therefore i cannot expect that simply
growing older should make me indifferent about letters  

 indifferent   oh  no  i never conceived you could become indifferent 
letters are no matter of indifference  they are generally a very
positive curse  

 you are speaking of letters of business  mine are letters
of friendship  

 i have often thought them the worst of the two   replied he coolly 
 business  you know  may bring money  but friendship hardly
ever does  

 ah  you are not serious now   i know mr  john knightley too well  
i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as
any body   i can easily believe that letters are very little to you 
much less than to me  but it is not your being ten years older than
myself which makes the difference  it is not age  but situation 
you have every body dearest to you always at hand  i  probably 
never shall again  and therefore till i have outlived all my affections 
a post office  i think  must always have power to draw me out 
in worse weather than to day  

 when i talked of your being altered by time  by the progress of years  
said john knightley   i meant to imply the change of situation
which time usually brings   i consider one as including the other 
time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within
the daily circle  but that is not the change i had in view for you 
as an old friend  you will allow me to hope  miss fairfax  that ten
years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have  

it was kindly said  and very far from giving offence   a pleasant
 thank you  seemed meant to laugh it off  but a blush  a quivering lip 
a tear in the eye  shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh 
her attention was now claimed by mr  woodhouse  who being 
according to his custom on such occasions  making the circle of
his guests  and paying his particular compliments to the ladies 
was ending with her  and with all his mildest urbanity  said 

 i am very sorry to hear  miss fairfax  of your being out this
morning in the rain   young ladies should take care of themselves   
young ladies are delicate plants   they should take care of their
health and their complexion   my dear  did you change your stockings  

 yes  sir  i did indeed  and i am very much obliged by your kind
solicitude about me  

 my dear miss fairfax  young ladies are very sure to be cared for   
i hope your good grand mama and aunt are well   they are some
of my very old friends   i wish my health allowed me to be a
better neighbour   you do us a great deal of honour to day  i am sure 
my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness 
and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield  

the kind hearted  polite old man might then sit down and feel
that he had done his duty  and made every fair lady welcome and easy 

by this time  the walk in the rain had reached mrs  elton 
and her remonstrances now opened upon jane 

 my dear jane  what is this i hear   going to the post office
in the rain   this must not be  i assure you   you sad girl 
how could you do such a thing   it is a sign i was not there
to take care of you  

jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold 

 oh  do not tell  me    you really are a very sad girl  and do not
know how to take care of yourself   to the post office indeed 
mrs  weston  did you ever hear the like   you and i must positively
exert our authority  

 my advice   said mrs  weston kindly and persuasively   i certainly
do feel tempted to give   miss fairfax  you must not run such risks   
liable as you have been to severe colds  indeed you ought
to be particularly careful  especially at this time of year 
the spring i always think requires more than common care 
better wait an hour or two  or even half a day for your letters 
than run the risk of bringing on your cough again   now do not you
feel that you had   yes  i am sure you are much too reasonable 
you look as if you would not do such a thing again  

 oh  she  shall   not  do such a thing again   eagerly rejoined
mrs  elton    we will not allow her to do such a thing again    
and nodding significantly   there must be some arrangement made 
there must indeed   i shall speak to mr  e  the man who fetches
our letters every morning  one of our men  i forget his name 
shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you   that will obviate
all difficulties you know  and from  us  i really think  my dear jane 
you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation  

 you are extremely kind   said jane   but i cannot give up my
early walk   i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can 
i must walk somewhere  and the post office is an object  and upon
my word  i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before  

 my dear jane  say no more about it   the thing is determined 
that is  laughing affectedly  as far as i can presume to determine
any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master   you know 
mrs  weston  you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves 
but i do flatter myself  my dear jane  that my influence is not entirely
worn out   if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore 
consider that point as settled  

 excuse me   said jane earnestly   i cannot by any means consent
to such an arrangement  so needlessly troublesome to your servant 
if the errand were not a pleasure to me  it could be done  as it
always is when i am not here  by my grandmama s  

 oh  my dear  but so much as patty has to do   and it is a kindness
to employ our men  

jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered  but instead
of answering  she began speaking again to mr  john knightley 

 the post office is a wonderful establishment   said she   
 the regularity and despatch of it   if one thinks of all that it
has to do  and all that it does so well  it is really astonishing  

 it is certainly very well regulated  

 so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears   so seldom
that a letter  among the thousands that are constantly passing
about the kingdom  is even carried wrong  and not one in a million 
i suppose  actually lost   and when one considers the variety
of hands  and of bad hands too  that are to be deciphered 
it increases the wonder  

 the clerks grow expert from habit   they must begin with some
quickness of sight and hand  and exercise improves them   if you
want any farther explanation   continued he  smiling   they are
paid for it   that is the key to a great deal of capacity 
the public pays and must be served well  

the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of  and the usual
observations made 

 i have heard it asserted   said john knightley   that the same
sort of handwriting often prevails in a family  and where the
same master teaches  it is natural enough   but for that reason 
i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females 
for boys have very little teaching after an early age  and scramble
into any hand they can get   isabella and emma  i think  do write
very much alike   i have not always known their writing apart  

 yes   said his brother hesitatingly   there is a likeness 
i know what you mean  but emma s hand is the strongest  

 isabella and emma both write beautifully   said mr  woodhouse 
 and always did   and so does poor mrs  weston   with half a sigh
and half a smile at her 

 i never saw any gentleman s handwriting   emma began  looking also
at mrs  weston  but stopped  on perceiving that mrs  weston was
attending to some one else  and the pause gave her time to reflect 
 now  how am i going to introduce him   am i unequal to speaking
his name at once before all these people   is it necessary
for me to use any roundabout phrase   your yorkshire friend  
your correspondent in yorkshire   that would be the way  i suppose 
if i were very bad   no  i can pronounce his name without the
smallest distress   i certainly get better and better   now for it  

mrs  weston was disengaged and emma began again   mr  frank churchill
writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw  

 i do not admire it   said mr  knightley    it is too small  
wants strength   it is like a woman s writing  

this was not submitted to by either lady   they vindicated him
against the base aspersion    no  it by no means wanted strength  
it was not a large hand  but very clear and certainly strong 
had not mrs  weston any letter about her to produce    no  she had
heard from him very lately  but having answered the letter  had put
it away 

 if we were in the other room   said emma   if i had my writing desk 
i am sure i could produce a specimen   i have a note of his   
do not you remember  mrs  weston  employing him to write for you
one day  

 he chose to say he was employed   

 well  well  i have that note  and can shew it after dinner
to convince mr  knightley  

 oh  when a gallant young man  like mr  frank churchill  
said mr  knightley dryly   writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse 
he will  of course  put forth his best  

dinner was on table   mrs  elton  before she could be spoken to 
was ready  and before mr  woodhouse had reached her with his request
to be allowed to hand her into the dining parlour  was saying  

 must i go first   i really am ashamed of always leading the way  

jane s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma 
she had heard and seen it all  and felt some curiosity to know
whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any   she suspected
that it  had   that it would not have been so resolutely encountered
but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear 
and that it had not been in vain   she thought there was an air
of greater happiness than usual  a glow both of complexion and spirits 

she could have made an inquiry or two  as to the expedition
and the expense of the irish mails   it was at her tongue s end  
but she abstained   she was quite determined not to utter a word
that should hurt jane fairfax s feelings  and they followed
the other ladies out of the room  arm in arm  with an appearance
of good will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each 



chapter xvii


when the ladies returned to the drawing room after dinner  emma found
it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties   
with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs  elton
engross jane fairfax and slight herself   she and mrs  weston were
obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together 
mrs  elton left them no choice   if jane repressed her for a
little time  she soon began again  and though much that passed
between them was in a half whisper  especially on mrs  elton s side 
there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects 
the post office  catching cold  fetching letters  and friendship 
were long under discussion  and to them succeeded one  which must
be at least equally unpleasant to jane  inquiries whether she had
yet heard of any situation likely to suit her  and professions of
mrs  elton s meditated activity 

 here is april come   said she   i get quite anxious about you 
june will soon be here  

 but i have never fixed on june or any other month  merely looked
forward to the summer in general  

 but have you really heard of nothing  

 i have not even made any inquiry  i do not wish to make any yet  

 oh  my dear  we cannot begin too early  you are not aware
of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing  

 i not aware   said jane  shaking her head   dear mrs  elton 
who can have thought of it as i have done  

 but you have not seen so much of the world as i have   you do not
know how many candidates there always are for the  first  situations 
i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove 
a cousin of mr  suckling  mrs  bragge  had such an infinity
of applications  every body was anxious to be in her family 
for she moves in the first circle   wax candles in the schoolroom 
you may imagine how desirable   of all houses in the kingdom
mrs  bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in  

 colonel and mrs  campbell are to be in town again by midsummer  
said jane    i must spend some time with them  i am sure they will
want it   afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself 
but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries
at present  

 trouble  aye  i know your scruples   you are afraid of giving
me trouble  but i assure you  my dear jane  the campbells can
hardly be more interested about you than i am   i shall write
to mrs  partridge in a day or two  and shall give her a strict
charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible  

 thank you  but i would rather you did not mention the subject
to her  till the time draws nearer  i do not wish to be giving
any body trouble  

 but  my dear child  the time is drawing near  here is april 
and june  or say even july  is very near  with such business
to accomplish before us   your inexperience really amuses me 
a situation such as you deserve  and your friends would require for you 
is no everyday occurrence  is not obtained at a moment s notice 
indeed  indeed  we must begin inquiring directly  

 excuse me  ma am  but this is by no means my intention  i make no
inquiry myself  and should be sorry to have any made by my friends 
when i am quite determined as to the time  i am not at all afraid
of being long unemployed   there are places in town  offices 
where inquiry would soon produce something  offices for the sale  
not quite of human flesh  but of human intellect  

 oh  my dear  human flesh   you quite shock me  if you mean a fling
at the slave trade  i assure you mr  suckling was always rather
a friend to the abolition  

 i did not mean  i was not thinking of the slave trade   replied jane 
 governess trade  i assure you  was all that i had in view 
widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on 
but as to the greater misery of the victims  i do not know where
it lies   but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices 
and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon
meeting with something that would do  

 something that would do   repeated mrs  elton    aye   that  may
suit your humble ideas of yourself   i know what a modest creature
you are  but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up
with any thing that may offer  any inferior  commonplace situation 
in a family not moving in a certain circle  or able to command
the elegancies of life  

 you are very obliging  but as to all that  i am very indifferent 
it would be no object to me to be with the rich  my mortifications 
i think  would only be the greater  i should suffer more from comparison 
a gentleman s family is all that i should condition for  

 i know you  i know you  you would take up with any thing  but i
shall be a little more nice  and i am sure the good campbells will
be quite on my side  with your superior talents  you have a right
to move in the first circle   your musical knowledge alone would
entitle you to name your own terms  have as many rooms as you like 
and mix in the family as much as you chose   that is  i do not know  
if you knew the harp  you might do all that  i am very sure 
but you sing as well as play   yes  i really believe you might 
even without the harp  stipulate for what you chose   and you must
and shall be delightfully  honourably and comfortably settled before
the campbells or i have any rest  

 you may well class the delight  the honour  and the comfort
of such a situation together   said jane   they are pretty sure
to be equal  however  i am very serious in not wishing any thing
to be attempted at present for me   i am exceedingly obliged to you 
mrs  elton  i am obliged to any body who feels for me  but i am
quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer 
for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am  and as
i am  

 and i am quite serious too  i assure you   replied mrs  elton gaily 
 in resolving to be always on the watch  and employing my friends
to watch also  that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us  

in this style she ran on  never thoroughly stopped by any thing
till mr  woodhouse came into the room  her vanity had then a change
of object  and emma heard her saying in the same half whisper to jane 

 here comes this dear old beau of mine  i protest   only think of his
gallantry in coming away before the other men   what a dear creature
he is   i assure you i like him excessively   i admire all that quaint 
old fashioned politeness  it is much more to my taste than modern ease 
modern ease often disgusts me   but this good old mr  woodhouse 
i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner   oh   i assure
you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous 
i fancy i am rather a favourite  he took notice of my gown 
how do you like it   selina s choice  handsome  i think  but i
do not know whether it is not over trimmed  i have the greatest
dislike to the idea of being over trimmed  quite a horror of finery 
i must put on a few ornaments now  because it is expected of me 
a bride  you know  must appear like a bride  but my natural taste
is all for simplicity  a simple style of dress is so infinitely
preferable to finery   but i am quite in the minority  i believe 
few people seem to value simplicity of dress   show and finery
are every thing   i have some notion of putting such a trimming
as this to my white and silver poplin   do you think it will
look well  

the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing room
when mr  weston made his appearance among them   he had returned
to a late dinner  and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over 
he had been too much expected by the best judges  for surprize  
but there was great joy   mr  woodhouse was almost as glad to see
him now  as he would have been sorry to see him before   john knightley
only was in mute astonishment   that a man who might have spent
his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london 
should set off again  and walk half a mile to another man s house 
for the sake of being in mixed company till bed time  of finishing
his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers 
was a circumstance to strike him deeply   a man who had been in motion
since eight o clock in the morning  and might now have been still 
who had been long talking  and might have been silent  who had been
in more than one crowd  and might have been alone   such a man 
to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside 
and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into
the world   could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken
back his wife  there would have been a motive  but his coming would
probably prolong rather than break up the party   john knightley
looked at him with amazement  then shrugged his shoulders  and said 
 i could not have believed it even of  him   

mr  weston meanwhile  perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation
he was exciting  happy and cheerful as usual  and with all
the right of being principal talker  which a day spent anywhere
from home confers  was making himself agreeable among the rest 
and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner 
convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants
had been forgotten  and spread abroad what public news he had heard 
was proceeding to a family communication  which  though principally
addressed to mrs  weston  he had not the smallest doubt of being
highly interesting to every body in the room   he gave her a letter 
it was from frank  and to herself  he had met with it in his way 
and had taken the liberty of opening it 

 read it  read it   said he   it will give you pleasure 
only a few lines  will not take you long  read it to emma  

the two ladies looked over it together  and he sat smiling
and talking to them the whole time  in a voice a little subdued 
but very audible to every body 

 well  he is coming  you see  good news  i think   well  what do
you say to it   i always told you he would be here again soon 
did not i   anne  my dear  did not i always tell you so  and you would
not believe me   in town next week  you see  at the latest  i dare say 
for  she  is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is
to be done  most likely they will be there to morrow or saturday 
as to her illness  all nothing of course   but it is an excellent
thing to have frank among us again  so near as town   they will stay
a good while when they do come  and he will be half his time with us 
this is precisely what i wanted   well  pretty good news  is not it 
have you finished it   has emma read it all   put it up  put it up 
we will have a good talk about it some other time  but it will not
do now   i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a
common way  

mrs  weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion 
her looks and words had nothing to restrain them   she was happy 
she knew she was happy  and knew she ought to be happy 
her congratulations were warm and open  but emma could not speak
so fluently    she  was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings 
and trying to understand the degree of her agitation  which she
rather thought was considerable 

mr  weston  however  too eager to be very observant  too communicative
to want others to talk  was very well satisfied with what she did say 
and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial
communication of what the whole room must have overheard already 

it was well that he took every body s joy for granted  or he
might not have thought either mr  woodhouse or mr  knightley
particularly delighted   they were the first entitled 
after mrs  weston and emma  to be made happy   from them he would
have proceeded to miss fairfax  but she was so deep in conversation
with john knightley  that it would have been too positive
an interruption  and finding himself close to mrs  elton  and
her attention disengaged  he necessarily began on the subject with her 



chapter xviii


 i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you  
said mr  weston 

mrs  elton  very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended
her by such a hope  smiled most graciously 

 you have heard of a certain frank churchill  i presume   he continued  
 and know him to be my son  though he does not bear my name  

 oh  yes  and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance 
i am sure mr  elton will lose no time in calling on him  and we
shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage  

 you are very obliging   frank will be extremely happy  i am sure   
he is to be in town next week  if not sooner   we have notice of it
in a letter to day  i met the letters in my way this morning 
and seeing my son s hand  presumed to open it  though it was not directed
to me  it was to mrs  weston   she is his principal correspondent 
i assure you   i hardly ever get a letter  

 and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her   oh   mr  weston  
 laughing affectedly  i must protest against that   a most dangerous
precedent indeed   i beg you will not let your neighbours follow
your example   upon my word  if this is what i am to expect 
we married women must begin to exert ourselves   oh   mr  weston 
i could not have believed it of you  

 aye  we men are sad fellows   you must take care of yourself 
mrs  elton   this letter tells us  it is a short letter  written in
a hurry  merely to give us notice  it tells us that they are all
coming up to town directly  on mrs  churchill s account  she has
not been well the whole winter  and thinks enscombe too cold for her  
so they are all to move southward without loss of time  

 indeed   from yorkshire  i think   enscombe is in yorkshire  

 yes  they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london 
a considerable journey  

 yes  upon my word  very considerable   sixty five miles farther
than from maple grove to london   but what is distance  mr  weston 
to people of large fortune   you would be amazed to hear how my brother 
mr  suckling  sometimes flies about   you will hardly believe me  
but twice in one week he and mr  bragge went to london and back again
with four horses  

 the evil of the distance from enscombe   said mr  weston   is  that
mrs  churchill   as   we   understand   has not been able to leave the
sofa for a week together   in frank s last letter she complained 
he said  of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having
both his arm and his uncle s  this  you know  speaks a great degree
of weakness  but now she is so impatient to be in town  that she
means to sleep only two nights on the road   so frank writes word 
certainly  delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions 
mrs  elton   you must grant me that  

 no  indeed  i shall grant you nothing   i always take the part
of my own sex   i do indeed   i give you notice  you will find me
a formidable antagonist on that point   i always stand up for women  
and i assure you  if you knew how selina feels with respect
to sleeping at an inn  you would not wonder at mrs  churchill s
making incredible exertions to avoid it   selina says it is quite
horror to her  and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety 
she always travels with her own sheets  an excellent precaution 
does mrs  churchill do the same  

 depend upon it  mrs  churchill does every thing that any other
fine lady ever did   mrs  churchill will not be second to any lady
in the land for   

mrs  elton eagerly interposed with 

 oh   mr  weston  do not mistake me   selina is no fine lady 
i assure you   do not run away with such an idea  

 is not she   then she is no rule for mrs  churchill  who is
as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld  

mrs  elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly 
it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister
was  not  a fine lady  perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence
of it   and she was considering in what way she had best retract 
when mr  weston went on 

 mrs  churchill is not much in my good graces  as you may suspect  
but this is quite between ourselves   she is very fond of frank 
and therefore i would not speak ill of her   besides  she is out of
health now  but  that  indeed  by her own account  she has always been 
i would not say so to every body  mrs  elton  but i have not much
faith in mrs  churchill s illness  

 if she is really ill  why not go to bath  mr  weston   to bath 
or to clifton     she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too
cold for her   the fact is  i suppose  that she is tired of enscombe 
she has now been a longer time stationary there  than she ever
was before  and she begins to want change   it is a retired place 
a fine place  but very retired  

 aye  like maple grove  i dare say   nothing can stand more retired from
the road than maple grove   such an immense plantation all round it 
you seem shut out from every thing  in the most complete retirement   
and mrs  churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina
to enjoy that sort of seclusion   or  perhaps she may not have
resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life 
i always say a woman cannot have too many resources  and i feel
very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent
of society  

 frank was here in february for a fortnight  

 so i remember to have heard   he will find an  addition  to the
society of highbury when he comes again  that is  if i may presume
to call myself an addition   but perhaps he may never have heard
of there being such a creature in the world  

this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by 
and mr  weston  with a very good grace  immediately exclaimed 

 my dear madam   nobody but yourself could imagine such a
thing possible   not heard of you   i believe mrs  weston s
letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs  elton  

he had done his duty and could return to his son 

 when frank left us   continued he   it was quite uncertain when we
might see him again  which makes this day s news doubly welcome 
it has been completely unexpected   that is   i  always had a strong
persuasion he would be here again soon  i was sure something
favourable would turn up  but nobody believed me   he and mrs  weston
were both dreadfully desponding    how could he contrive to come 
and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare
him again   and so forth  i always felt that something would happen
in our favour  and so it has  you see   i have observed  mrs  elton 
in the course of my life  that if things are going untowardly one month 
they are sure to mend the next  

 very true  mr  weston  perfectly true   it is just what i used
to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship 
when  because things did not go quite right  did not proceed with all
the rapidity which suited his feelings  he was apt to be in despair 
and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be  may  before
hymen s saffron robe would be put on for us   oh  the pains i have
been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views 
the carriage  we had disappointments about the carriage   one morning 
i remember  he came to me quite in despair  

she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing  and mr  weston instantly
seized the opportunity of going on 

 you were mentioning may   may is the very month which mrs  churchill
is ordered  or has ordered herself  to spend in some warmer place
than enscombe  in short  to spend in london  so that we have the
agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring  
precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen
for it   days almost at the longest  weather genial and pleasant 
always inviting one out  and never too hot for exercise   when he
was here before  we made the best of it  but there was a good deal
of wet  damp  cheerless weather  there always is in february  you know 
and we could not do half that we intended   now will be the time 
this will be complete enjoyment  and i do not know  mrs  elton 
whether the uncertainty of our meetings  the sort of constant
expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow 
and at any hour  may not be more friendly to happiness than having
him actually in the house   i think it is so   i think it is the
state of mind which gives most spirit and delight   i hope you
will be pleased with my son  but you must not expect a prodigy 
he is generally thought a fine young man  but do not expect a prodigy 
mrs  weston s partiality for him is very great  and  as you may suppose 
most gratifying to me   she thinks nobody equal to him  

 and i assure you  mr  weston  i have very little doubt that my
opinion will be decidedly in his favour   i have heard so much
in praise of mr  frank churchill   at the same time it is fair
to observe  that i am one of those who always judge for themselves 
and are by no means implicitly guided by others   i give you notice
that as i find your son  so i shall judge of him   i am no flatterer  

mr  weston was musing 

 i hope   said he presently   i have not been severe upon poor
mrs  churchill   if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice 
but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult
for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish 
you cannot be ignorant  mrs  elton  of my connexion with the family 
nor of the treatment i have met with  and  between ourselves 
the whole blame of it is to be laid to her   she was the instigator 
frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her 
mr  churchill has pride  but his pride is nothing to his wife s 
his is a quiet  indolent  gentlemanlike sort of pride that would
harm nobody  and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome 
but her pride is arrogance and insolence   and what inclines one less
to bear  she has no fair pretence of family or blood   she was nobody
when he married her  barely the daughter of a gentleman  but ever
since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them
all in high and mighty claims   but in herself  i assure you  she is
an upstart  

 only think  well  that must be infinitely provoking   i have quite
a horror of upstarts   maple grove has given me a thorough disgust
to people of that sort  for there is a family in that neighbourhood
who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs
they give themselves   your description of mrs  churchill made me
think of them directly   people of the name of tupman  very lately
settled there  and encumbered with many low connexions  but giving
themselves immense airs  and expecting to be on a footing with the old
established families   a year and a half is the very utmost that they can
have lived at west hall  and how they got their fortune nobody knows 
they came from birmingham  which is not a place to promise much 
you know  mr  weston   one has not great hopes from birmingham 
i always say there is something direful in the sound   but nothing
more is positively known of the tupmans  though a good many things
i assure you are suspected  and yet by their manners they evidently
think themselves equal even to my brother  mr  suckling  who happens
to be one of their nearest neighbours   it is infinitely too bad 
mr  suckling  who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove 
and whose father had it before him  i believe  at least  i am
almost sure that old mr  suckling had completed the purchase before
his death  

they were interrupted   tea was carrying round  and mr  weston 
having said all that he wanted  soon took the opportunity of
walking away 

after tea  mr  and mrs  weston  and mr  elton sat down with mr  woodhouse
to cards   the remaining five were left to their own powers 
and emma doubted their getting on very well  for mr  knightley seemed
little disposed for conversation  mrs  elton was wanting notice 
which nobody had inclination to pay  and she was herself
in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent 

mr  john knightley proved more talkative than his brother 
he was to leave them early the next day  and he soon began with  

 well  emma  i do not believe i have any thing more to say about
the boys  but you have your sister s letter  and every thing is
down at full length there we may be sure   my charge would be much
more concise than her s  and probably not much in the same spirit 
all that i have to recommend being comprised in  do not spoil them 
and do not physic them  

 i rather hope to satisfy you both   said emma   for i shall do all
in my power to make them happy  which will be enough for isabella 
and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic  

 and if you find them troublesome  you must send them home again  

 that is very likely   you think so  do not you  

 i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father  
or even may be some encumbrance to you  if your visiting engagements
continue to increase as much as they have done lately  

 increase  

 certainly  you must be sensible that the last half year has made
a great difference in your way of life  

 difference   no indeed i am not  

 there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company
than you used to be   witness this very time   here am i come
down for only one day  and you are engaged with a dinner party   
when did it happen before  or any thing like it   your neighbourhood
is increasing  and you mix more with it   a little while ago 
every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties 
dinners at mr  cole s  or balls at the crown   the difference
which randalls  randalls alone makes in your goings on  is very great  

 yes   said his brother quickly   it is randalls that does it all  

 very well  and as randalls  i suppose  is not likely to have less
influence than heretofore  it strikes me as a possible thing  emma 
that henry and john may be sometimes in the way   and if they are 
i only beg you to send them home  

 no   cried mr  knightley   that need not be the consequence 
let them be sent to donwell   i shall certainly be at leisure  

 upon my word   exclaimed emma   you amuse me   i should like to know
how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being
of the party  and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure
to attend to the little boys   these amazing engagements of mine  
what have they been   dining once with the coles  and having a ball
talked of  which never took place   i can understand you   nodding at
mr  john knightley   your good fortune in meeting with so many of
your friends at once here  delights you too much to pass unnoticed 
but you   turning to mr  knightley   who know how very  very seldom
i am ever two hours from hartfield  why you should foresee such a
series of dissipation for me  i cannot imagine   and as to my dear
little boys  i must say  that if aunt emma has not time for them 
i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley 
who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one  
and who  when he is at home  is either reading to himself or settling
his accounts  

mr  knightley seemed to be trying not to smile  and succeeded
without difficulty  upon mrs  elton s beginning to talk to him 




volume iii



chapter i


a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the
nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill 
she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at
all apprehensive or embarrassed  it was for him   her own attachment
had really subsided into a mere nothing  it was not worth thinking of   
but if he  who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love
of the two  were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment
which he had taken away  it would be very distressing   if a separation
of two months should not have cooled him  there were dangers and evils
before her   caution for him and for herself would be necessary 
she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again 
and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his 

she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration 
that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance 
and yet  she could not help rather anticipating something decisive 
she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis 
an event  a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state 

it was not very long  though rather longer than mr  weston had foreseen 
before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill s
feelings   the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had
been imagined  but he was at highbury very soon afterwards   he rode
down for a couple of hours  he could not yet do more  but as he came
from randalls immediately to hartfield  she could then exercise all
her quick observation  and speedily determine how he was influenced 
and how she must act   they met with the utmost friendliness 
there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her 
but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he
had done  of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree 
she watched him well   it was a clear thing he was less in love than he
had been   absence  with the conviction probably of her indifference 
had produced this very natural and very desirable effect 

he was in high spirits  as ready to talk and laugh as ever  and seemed
delighted to speak of his former visit  and recur to old stories 
and he was not without agitation   it was not in his calmness that
she read his comparative difference   he was not calm  his spirits
were evidently fluttered  there was restlessness about him 
lively as he was  it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself 
but what decided her belief on the subject  was his staying only a
quarter of an hour  and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury 
 he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed  
he had not stopped  he would not stop for more than a word  but he
had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call 
and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield  he must hurry off  
she had no doubt as to his being less in love  but neither his
agitated spirits  nor his hurrying away  seemed like a perfect cure 
and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her
returning power  and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself
with her long 

this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days 
he was often hoping  intending to come  but was always prevented 
his aunt could not bear to have him leave her   such was his own account
at randall s  if he were quite sincere  if he really tried to come 
it was to be inferred that mrs  churchill s removal to london had
been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder 
that she was really ill was very certain  he had declared himself
convinced of it  at randalls   though much might be fancy  he could
not doubt  when he looked back  that she was in a weaker state
of health than she had been half a year ago   he did not believe it
to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove 
or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her 
but he could not be prevailed on  by all his father s doubts  to say
that her complaints were merely imaginary  or that she was as strong
as ever 

it soon appeared that london was not the place for her   she could
not endure its noise   her nerves were under continual irritation
and suffering  and by the ten days  end  her nephew s letter to
randalls communicated a change of plan   they were going to remove
immediately to richmond   mrs  churchill had been recommended
to the medical skill of an eminent person there  and had otherwise
a fancy for the place   a ready furnished house in a favourite
spot was engaged  and much benefit expected from the change 

emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement 
and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two
months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends  
for the house was taken for may and june   she was told that now
he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them 
almost as often as he could even wish 

emma saw how mr  weston understood these joyous prospects   he was
considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered 
she hoped it was not so   two months must bring it to the proof 

mr  weston s own happiness was indisputable   he was quite delighted 
it was the very circumstance he could have wished for   now  it would
be really having frank in their neighbourhood   what were nine miles
to a young man   an hour s ride   he would be always coming over 
the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough
to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing
him never   sixteen miles  nay  eighteen  it must be full eighteen
to manchester street  was a serious obstacle   were he ever able
to get away  the day would be spent in coming and returning 
there was no comfort in having him in london  he might as well be
at enscombe  but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse 
better than nearer 

one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal   
the ball at the crown   it had not been forgotten before  but it had
been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day   now  however 
it was absolutely to be  every preparation was resumed  and very soon
after the churchills had removed to richmond  a few lines from frank 
to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change 
and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty four
hours at any given time  induced them to name as early a day as possible 

mr  weston s ball was to be a real thing   a very few to morrows
stood between the young people of highbury and happiness 

mr  woodhouse was resigned   the time of year lightened the evil
to him   may was better for every thing than february   mrs  bates
was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield  james had due notice 
and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear
little john would have any thing the matter with them  while dear
emma were gone 



chapter ii


no misfortune occurred  again to prevent the ball   the day approached 
the day arrived  and after a morning of some anxious watching 
frank churchill  in all the certainty of his own self  reached randalls
before dinner  and every thing was safe 

no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma 
the room at the crown was to witness it   but it would be better
than a common meeting in a crowd   mr  weston had been so very
earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible
after themselves  for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the
propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came 
that she could not refuse him  and must therefore spend some quiet
interval in the young man s company   she was to convey harriet 
and they drove to the crown in good time  the randalls party just
sufficiently before them 

frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch  and though
he did not say much  his eyes declared that he meant to have
a delightful evening   they all walked about together  to see
that every thing was as it should be  and within a few minutes
were joined by the contents of another carriage  which emma
could not hear the sound of at first  without great surprize 
 so unreasonably early   she was going to exclaim  but she presently
found that it was a family of old friends  who were coming  like herself 
by particular desire  to help mr  weston s judgment  and they were
so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins  who had been
entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness 
on the same errand  that it seemed as if half the company might
soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection 

emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which
mr  weston depended  and felt  that to be the favourite and
intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes 
was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity 
she liked his open manners  but a little less of open heartedness
would have made him a higher character   general benevolence 
but not general friendship  made a man what he ought to be   
she could fancy such a man   the whole party walked about 
and looked  and praised again  and then  having nothing else to do 
formed a sort of half circle round the fire  to observe in their
various modes  till other subjects were started  that  though  may  
a fire in the evening was still very pleasant 

emma found that it was not mr  weston s fault that the number
of privy councillors was not yet larger   they had stopped
at mrs  bates s door to offer the use of their carriage 
but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons 

frank was standing by her  but not steadily  there was a restlessness 
which shewed a mind not at ease   he was looking about  he was going
to the door  he was watching for the sound of other carriages   
impatient to begin  or afraid of being always near her 

mrs  elton was spoken of    i think she must be here soon   said he 
 i have a great curiosity to see mrs  elton  i have heard so much
of her   it cannot be long  i think  before she comes  

a carriage was heard   he was on the move immediately 
but coming back  said 

 i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her   i have never seen
either mr  or mrs  elton   i have no business to put myself forward  

mr  and mrs  elton appeared  and all the smiles and the proprieties passed 

 but miss bates and miss fairfax   said mr  weston  looking about 
 we thought you were to bring them  

the mistake had been slight   the carriage was sent for them now 
emma longed to know what frank s first opinion of mrs  elton
might be  how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress 
and her smiles of graciousness   he was immediately qualifying
himself to form an opinion  by giving her very proper attention 
after the introduction had passed 

in a few minutes the carriage returned   somebody talked of rain   
 i will see that there are umbrellas  sir   said frank to his father 
 miss bates must not be forgotten    and away he went   mr  weston
was following  but mrs  elton detained him  to gratify him by her
opinion of his son  and so briskly did she begin  that the young
man himself  though by no means moving slowly  could hardly be out
of hearing 

 a very fine young man indeed  mr  weston   you know i candidly told
you i should form my own opinion  and i am happy to say that i am
extremely pleased with him   you may believe me   i never compliment 
i think him a very handsome young man  and his manners are precisely
what i like and approve  so truly the gentleman  without the least
conceit or puppyism   you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies  
quite a horror of them   they were never tolerated at maple grove 
neither mr  suckling nor me had ever any patience with them  and we
used sometimes to say very cutting things   selina  who is mild almost
to a fault  bore with them much better  

while she talked of his son  mr  weston s attention was chained 
but when she got to maple grove  he could recollect that there were
ladies just arriving to be attended to  and with happy smiles must
hurry away 

mrs  elton turned to mrs  weston    i have no doubt of its being
our carriage with miss bates and jane   our coachman and horses are
so extremely expeditious   i believe we drive faster than any body   
what a pleasure it is to send one s carriage for a friend   
i understand you were so kind as to offer  but another time it
will be quite unnecessary   you may be very sure i shall always
take care of  them   

miss bates and miss fairfax  escorted by the two gentlemen 
walked into the room  and mrs  elton seemed to think it as much
her duty as mrs  weston s to receive them   her gestures and
movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma 
but her words  every body s words  were soon lost under the
incessant flow of miss bates  who came in talking  and had not
finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted
into the circle at the fire   as the door opened she was heard 

 so very obliging of you   no rain at all   nothing to signify 
i do not care for myself   quite thick shoes   and jane declares  
well    as soon as she was within the door  well   this is brilliant
indeed   this is admirable   excellently contrived  upon my word 
nothing wanting   could not have imagined it   so well lighted up   
jane  jane  look   did you ever see any thing   oh   mr  weston 
you must really have had aladdin s lamp   good mrs  stokes
would not know her own room again   i saw her as i came in 
she was standing in the entrance    oh   mrs  stokes   said i  
but i had not time for more    she was now met by mrs  weston   
 very well  i thank you  ma am  i hope you are quite well 
very happy to hear it   so afraid you might have a headache   
seeing you pass by so often  and knowing how much trouble you must have 
delighted to hear it indeed   ah  dear mrs  elton  so obliged
to you for the carriage   excellent time   jane and i quite ready 
did not keep the horses a moment   most comfortable carriage   
oh  and i am sure our thanks are due to you  mrs  weston  on that score 
mrs  elton had most kindly sent jane a note  or we should have been   
but two such offers in one day   never were such neighbours 
i said to my mother   upon my word  ma am      thank you  my mother
is remarkably well   gone to mr  woodhouse s  i made her take
her shawl  for the evenings are not warm  her large new shawl  
mrs  dixon s wedding present   so kind of her to think of my mother 
bought at weymouth  you know  mr  dixon s choice   there were
three others  jane says  which they hesitated about some time 
colonel campbell rather preferred an olive   my dear jane 
are you sure you did not wet your feet   it was but a drop or two 
but i am so afraid   but mr  frank churchill was so extremely  
and there was a mat to step upon  i shall never forget his
extreme politeness   oh   mr  frank churchill  i must tell you
my mother s spectacles have never been in fault since  the rivet
never came out again   my mother often talks of your good nature 
does not she  jane   do not we often talk of mr  frank churchill   
ah  here s miss woodhouse   dear miss woodhouse  how do you do   
very well i thank you  quite well   this is meeting quite in fairy land   
such a transformation   must not compliment  i know  eyeing emma
most complacently   that would be rude  but upon my word  miss woodhouse 
you do look  how do you like jane s hair   you are a judge   
she did it all herself   quite wonderful how she does her hair   
no hairdresser from london i think could   ah  dr  hughes i declare  
and mrs  hughes   must go and speak to dr  and mrs  hughes for
a moment   how do you do   how do you do   very well  i thank you 
this is delightful  is not it   where s dear mr  richard   
oh  there he is   don t disturb him   much better employed talking
to the young ladies   how do you do  mr  richard   i saw you the
other day as you rode through the town  mrs  otway  i protest   
and good mr  otway  and miss otway and miss caroline   such a host
of friends   and mr  george and mr  arthur   how do you do   how do
you all do   quite well  i am much obliged to you   never better   
don t i hear another carriage   who can this be   very likely the
worthy coles   upon my word  this is charming to be standing about
among such friends   and such a noble fire   i am quite roasted 
no coffee  i thank you  for me  never take coffee   a little tea
if you please  sir  by and bye   no hurry  oh  here it comes 
every thing so good  

frank churchill returned to his station by emma  and as soon as miss
bates was quiet  she found herself necessarily overhearing the
discourse of mrs  elton and miss fairfax  who were standing a little
way behind her   he was thoughtful   whether he were overhearing too 
she could not determine   after a good many compliments to jane
on her dress and look  compliments very quietly and properly taken 
mrs  elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself  
and it was   how do you like my gown   how do you like my trimming   
how has wright done my hair    with many other relative questions 
all answered with patient politeness   mrs  elton then said 
 nobody can think less of dress in general than i do  but upon such
an occasion as this  when every body s eyes are so much upon me 
and in compliment to the westons  who i have no doubt are giving
this ball chiefly to do me honour  i would not wish to be inferior
to others   and i see very few pearls in the room except mine   
so frank churchill is a capital dancer  i understand   we shall see
if our styles suit   a fine young man certainly is frank churchill 
i like him very well  

at this moment frank began talking so vigorously  that emma could
not but imagine he had overheard his own praises  and did not want
to hear more   and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while 
till another suspension brought mrs  elton s tones again distinctly
forward   mr  elton had just joined them  and his wife was exclaiming 

 oh  you have found us out at last  have you  in our seclusion   
i was this moment telling jane  i thought you would begin to be
impatient for tidings of us  

 jane    repeated frank churchill  with a look of surprize and displeasure   
 that is easy  but miss fairfax does not disapprove it  i suppose  

 how do you like mrs  elton   said emma in a whisper 

 not at all  

 you are ungrateful  

 ungrateful   what do you mean    then changing from a frown to
a smile   no  do not tell me  i do not want to know what you mean   
where is my father   when are we to begin dancing  

emma could hardly understand him  he seemed in an odd humour 
he walked off to find his father  but was quickly back again with both
mr  and mrs  weston   he had met with them in a little perplexity 
which must be laid before emma   it had just occurred to mrs  weston
that mrs  elton must be asked to begin the ball  that she would
expect it  which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma
that distinction   emma heard the sad truth with fortitude 

 and what are we to do for a proper partner for her   said mr  weston 
 she will think frank ought to ask her  

frank turned instantly to emma  to claim her former promise 
and boasted himself an engaged man  which his father looked his most
perfect approbation of  and it then appeared that mrs  weston was
wanting  him  to dance with mrs  elton himself  and that their business
was to help to persuade him into it  which was done pretty soon   
mr  weston and mrs  elton led the way  mr  frank churchill and miss
woodhouse followed   emma must submit to stand second to mrs  elton 
though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her 
it was almost enough to make her think of marrying   mrs  elton had
undoubtedly the advantage  at this time  in vanity completely gratified 
for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill  she could
not lose by the change   mr  weston might be his son s superior   
in spite of this little rub  however  emma was smiling with enjoyment 
delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming 
and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her   
she was more disturbed by mr  knightley s not dancing than by any
thing else   there he was  among the standers by  where he ought not
to be  he ought to be dancing   not classing himself with the husbands 
and fathers  and whist players  who were pretending to feel an interest
in the dance till their rubbers were made up   so young as he looked   
he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere 
than where he had placed himself   his tall  firm  upright figure 
among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men 
was such as emma felt must draw every body s eyes  and  excepting her
own partner  there was not one among the whole row of young men
who could be compared with him   he moved a few steps nearer 
and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike
a manner  with what natural grace  he must have danced  would he
but take the trouble   whenever she caught his eye  she forced him
to smile  but in general he was looking grave   she wished he could
love a ballroom better  and could like frank churchill better   
he seemed often observing her   she must not flatter herself that he
thought of her dancing  but if he were criticising her behaviour 
she did not feel afraid   there was nothing like flirtation between
her and her partner   they seemed more like cheerful  easy friends 
than lovers   that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done 
was indubitable 

the ball proceeded pleasantly   the anxious cares  the incessant
attentions of mrs  weston  were not thrown away   every body
seemed happy  and the praise of being a delightful ball 
which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be 
was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this 
of very important  very recordable events  it was not more productive
than such meetings usually are   there was one  however  which emma
thought something of   the two last dances before supper were begun 
and harriet had no partner   the only young lady sitting down   
and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers  that how there
could be any one disengaged was the wonder   but emma s wonder
lessened soon afterwards  on seeing mr  elton sauntering about 
he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided 
she was sure he would not  and she was expecting him every moment to
escape into the card room 

escape  however  was not his plan   he came to the part of the room
where the sitters by were collected  spoke to some  and walked about
in front of them  as if to shew his liberty  and his resolution
of maintaining it   he did not omit being sometimes directly
before miss smith  or speaking to those who were close to her   
emma saw it   she was not yet dancing  she was working her way
up from the bottom  and had therefore leisure to look around 
and by only turning her head a little she saw it all   when she was
half way up the set  the whole group were exactly behind her  and she
would no longer allow her eyes to watch  but mr  elton was so near 
that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took
place between him and mrs  weston  and she perceived that his wife 
who was standing immediately above her  was not only listening also 
but even encouraging him by significant glances   the kind hearted 
gentle mrs  weston had left her seat to join him and say   do not
you dance  mr  elton   to which his prompt reply was   most readily 
mrs  weston  if you will dance with me  

 me   oh  no  i would get you a better partner than myself 
i am no dancer  

 if mrs  gilbert wishes to dance   said he   i shall have great pleasure 
i am sure  for  though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man 
and that my dancing days are over  it would give me very great
pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs  gilbert  

 mrs  gilbert does not mean to dance  but there is a young lady
disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing  miss smith  
 miss smith   oh   i had not observed   you are extremely obliging  
and if i were not an old married man   but my dancing days are over 
mrs  weston   you will excuse me   any thing else i should be most happy
to do  at your command  but my dancing days are over  

mrs  weston said no more  and emma could imagine with what
surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat 
this was mr  elton  the amiable  obliging  gentle mr  elton   
she looked round for a moment  he had joined mr  knightley at a
little distance  and was arranging himself for settled conversation 
while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife 

she would not look again   her heart was in a glow  and she feared
her face might be as hot 

in another moment a happier sight caught her   mr  knightley
leading harriet to the set   never had she been more surprized 
seldom more delighted  than at that instant   she was all pleasure
and gratitude  both for harriet and herself  and longed to be
thanking him  and though too distant for speech  her countenance
said much  as soon as she could catch his eye again 

his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it 
extremely good  and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky 
if it had not been for the cruel state of things before  and for
the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction
which her happy features announced   it was not thrown away on her 
she bounded higher than ever  flew farther down the middle 
and was in a continual course of smiles 

mr  elton had retreated into the card room  looking  emma trusted 
very foolish   she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife 
though growing very like her    she  spoke some of her feelings 
by observing audibly to her partner 

 knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith   very goodnatured 
i declare  

supper was announced   the move began  and miss bates might be
heard from that moment  without interruption  till her being
seated at table and taking up her spoon 

 jane  jane  my dear jane  where are you   here is your tippet 
mrs  weston begs you to put on your tippet   she says she is afraid
there will be draughts in the passage  though every thing has
been done  one door nailed up  quantities of matting  my dear jane 
indeed you must   mr  churchill  oh  you are too obliging 
how well you put it on   so gratified   excellent dancing indeed   
yes  my dear  i ran home  as i said i should  to help grandmama
to bed  and got back again  and nobody missed me   i set off without
saying a word  just as i told you   grandmama was quite well 
had a charming evening with mr  woodhouse  a vast deal of chat 
and backgammon   tea was made downstairs  biscuits and baked apples
and wine before she came away   amazing luck in some of her throws 
and she inquired a great deal about you  how you were amused 
and who were your partners    oh   said i   i shall not forestall jane 
i left her dancing with mr  george otway  she will love to tell you
all about it herself to morrow  her first partner was mr  elton 
i do not know who will ask her next  perhaps mr  william cox  
my dear sir  you are too obliging   is there nobody you would
not rather   i am not helpless   sir  you are most kind   upon my word 
jane on one arm  and me on the other   stop  stop  let us stand
a little back  mrs  elton is going  dear mrs  elton  how elegant
she looks   beautiful lace   now we all follow in her train 
quite the queen of the evening   well  here we are at the passage 
two steps  jane  take care of the two steps   oh  no  there is
but one   well  i was persuaded there were two   how very odd 
i was convinced there were two  and there is but one   i never saw any
thing equal to the comfort and style  candles everywhere   i was telling
you of your grandmama  jane   there was a little disappointment   
the baked apples and biscuits  excellent in their way  you know 
but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus
brought in at first  and good mr  woodhouse  not thinking the
asparagus quite boiled enough  sent it all out again   now there
is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus  
so she was rather disappointed  but we agreed we would not speak of it
to any body  for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse 
who would be so very much concerned   well  this is brilliant 
i am all amazement  could not have supposed any thing   such
elegance and profusion   i have seen nothing like it since  
well  where shall we sit  where shall we sit   anywhere  so that
jane is not in a draught   where  i  sit is of no consequence 
oh  do you recommend this side   well  i am sure  mr  churchill  
only it seems too good  but just as you please   what you direct
in this house cannot be wrong   dear jane  how shall we ever
recollect half the dishes for grandmama   soup too   bless me 
i should not be helped so soon  but it smells most excellent  and i
cannot help beginning  

emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr  knightley till
after supper  but  when they were all in the ballroom again 
her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked 
he was warm in his reprobation of mr  elton s conduct  it had been
unpardonable rudeness  and mrs  elton s looks also received the due
share of censure 

 they aimed at wounding more than harriet   said he    emma  why
is it that they are your enemies  

he looked with smiling penetration  and  on receiving
no answer  added    she  ought not to be angry with you  i suspect 
whatever he may be   to that surmise  you say nothing  of course 
but confess  emma  that you did want him to marry harriet  

 i did   replied emma   and they cannot forgive me  

he shook his head  but there was a smile of indulgence with it 
and he only said 

 i shall not scold you   i leave you to your own reflections  

 can you trust me with such flatterers   does my vain spirit ever
tell me i am wrong  

 not your vain spirit  but your serious spirit   if one leads
you wrong  i am sure the other tells you of it  

 i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr  elton 
there is a littleness about him which you discovered  and which i
did not   and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet 
it was through a series of strange blunders  

 and  in return for your acknowledging so much  i will do you the justice
to say  that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for
himself   harriet smith has some first rate qualities  which mrs  elton
is totally without   an unpretending  single minded  artless girl  
infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such
a woman as mrs  elton   i found harriet more conversable than i expected  

emma was extremely gratified   they were interrupted by the bustle
of mr  weston calling on every body to begin dancing again 

 come miss woodhouse  miss otway  miss fairfax  what are you all doing   
come emma  set your companions the example   every body is lazy 
every body is asleep  

 i am ready   said emma   whenever i am wanted  

 whom are you going to dance with   asked mr  knightley 

she hesitated a moment  and then replied   with you  if you will
ask me  

 will you   said he  offering his hand 

 indeed i will   you have shewn that you can dance  and you know we
are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper  

 brother and sister  no  indeed  



chapter iii


this little explanation with mr  knightley gave emma considerable
pleasure   it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball 
which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy   she was
extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting
the eltons  and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so
much alike  and his praise of harriet  his concession in her favour 
was peculiarly gratifying   the impertinence of the eltons  which for
a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening  had been
the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions  and she looked
forward to another happy result  the cure of harriet s infatuation   
from harriet s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they
quitted the ballroom  she had strong hopes   it seemed as if her eyes
were suddenly opened  and she were enabled to see that mr  elton
was not the superior creature she had believed him   the fever
was over  and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being
quickened again by injurious courtesy   she depended on the evil
feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed
neglect that could be farther requisite   harriet rational 
frank churchill not too much in love  and mr  knightley not
wanting to quarrel with her  how very happy a summer must be before her 

she was not to see frank churchill this morning   he had told
her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping
at hartfield  as he was to be at home by the middle of the day 
she did not regret it 

having arranged all these matters  looked them through  and put them all
to rights  she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up
for the demands of the two little boys  as well as of their grandpapa 
when the great iron sweep gate opened  and two persons entered
whom she had never less expected to see together  frank churchill 
with harriet leaning on his arm  actually harriet   a moment
sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened 
harriet looked white and frightened  and he was trying to cheer her   
the iron gates and the front door were not twenty yards asunder   
they were all three soon in the hall  and harriet immediately sinking
into a chair fainted away 

a young lady who faints  must be recovered  questions must be answered 
and surprizes be explained   such events are very interesting 
but the suspense of them cannot last long   a few minutes made emma
acquainted with the whole 

miss smith  and miss bickerton  another parlour boarder at
mrs  goddard s  who had been also at the ball  had walked out together 
and taken a road  the richmond road  which  though apparently public
enough for safety  had led them into alarm   about half a mile
beyond highbury  making a sudden turn  and deeply shaded by elms
on each side  it became for a considerable stretch very retired 
and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it 
they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them 
on a broader patch of greensward by the side  a party of gipsies 
a child on the watch  came towards them to beg  and miss bickerton 
excessively frightened  gave a great scream  and calling on harriet
to follow her  ran up a steep bank  cleared a slight hedge at the top 
and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury 
but poor harriet could not follow   she had suffered very much
from cramp after dancing  and her first attempt to mount the bank
brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless  
and in this state  and exceedingly terrified  she had been obliged
to remain 

how the trampers might have behaved  had the young ladies been
more courageous  must be doubtful  but such an invitation for attack
could not be resisted  and harriet was soon assailed by half a
dozen children  headed by a stout woman and a great boy  all clamorous 
and impertinent in look  though not absolutely in word   more and
more frightened  she immediately promised them money  and taking out
her purse  gave them a shilling  and begged them not to want more 
or to use her ill   she was then able to walk  though but slowly 
and was moving away  but her terror and her purse were too tempting 
and she was followed  or rather surrounded  by the whole gang 
demanding more 

in this state frank churchill had found her  she trembling
and conditioning  they loud and insolent   by a most fortunate
chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him
to her assistance at this critical moment   the pleasantness
of the morning had induced him to walk forward  and leave his
horses to meet him by another road  a mile or two beyond highbury  
and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before
of miss bates  and to have forgotten to restore them  he had
been obliged to stop at her door  and go in for a few minutes 
he was therefore later than he had intended  and being on foot 
was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them 
the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet
was then their own portion   he had left them completely frightened 
and harriet eagerly clinging to him  and hardly able to speak 
had just strength enough to reach hartfield  before her spirits
were quite overcome   it was his idea to bring her to hartfield 
he had thought of no other place 

this was the amount of the whole story   of his communication and
of harriet s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech   
he dared not stay longer than to see her well  these several delays
left him not another minute to lose  and emma engaging to give
assurance of her safety to mrs  goddard  and notice of there
being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr  knightley 
he set off  with all the grateful blessings that she could utter
for her friend and herself 

such an adventure as this   a fine young man and a lovely young
woman thrown together in such a way  could hardly fail of suggesting
certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain 
so emma thought  at least   could a linguist  could a grammarian 
could even a mathematician have seen what she did  have witnessed their
appearance together  and heard their history of it  without feeling
that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting
to each other   how much more must an imaginist  like herself 
be on fire with speculation and foresight   especially with such
a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made 

it was a very extraordinary thing   nothing of the sort had ever
occurred before to any young ladies in the place  within her memory 
no rencontre  no alarm of the kind   and now it had happened
to the very person  and at the very hour  when the other very
person was chancing to pass by to rescue her   it certainly
was very extraordinary   and knowing  as she did  the favourable
state of mind of each at this period  it struck her the more 
he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself 
she just recovering from her mania for mr  elton   it seemed as if
every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences 
it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly
recommending each to the other 

in the few minutes  conversation which she had yet had with him 
while harriet had been partially insensible  he had spoken of her terror 
her naivete  her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm  with a
sensibility amused and delighted  and just at last  after harriet s
own account had been given  he had expressed his indignation
at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms 
every thing was to take its natural course  however  neither impelled
nor assisted   she would not stir a step  nor drop a hint 
no  she had had enough of interference   there could be no harm
in a scheme  a mere passive scheme   it was no more than a wish 
beyond it she would on no account proceed 

emma s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge
of what had passed   aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion 
but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible   within half
an hour it was known all over highbury   it was the very event
to engage those who talk most  the young and the low  and all
the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of
frightful news   the last night s ball seemed lost in the gipsies 
poor mr  woodhouse trembled as he sat  and  as emma had foreseen 
would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go
beyond the shrubbery again   it was some comfort to him that many
inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse  for his neighbours
knew that he loved to be inquired after   as well as miss smith 
were coming in during the rest of the day  and he had the pleasure
of returning for answer  that they were all very indifferent  
which  though not exactly true  for she was perfectly well 
and harriet not much otherwise  emma would not interfere with 
she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such
a man  for she hardly knew what indisposition was  and if he did not
invent illnesses for her  she could make no figure in a message 

the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice  they took
themselves off in a hurry   the young ladies of highbury might have
walked again in safety before their panic began  and the whole
history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma
and her nephews   in her imagination it maintained its ground 
and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of
harriet and the gipsies  and still tenaciously setting her right
if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital 



chapter iv


a very few days had passed after this adventure  when harriet came
one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand  and after
sitting down and hesitating  thus began 

 miss woodhouse  if you are at leisure  i have something that i
should like to tell you  a sort of confession to make  and then 
you know  it will be over  

emma was a good deal surprized  but begged her to speak 
there was a seriousness in harriet s manner which prepared her 
quite as much as her words  for something more than ordinary 

 it is my duty  and i am sure it is my wish   she continued 
 to have no reserves with you on this subject   as i am happily
quite an altered creature in  one   respect   it is very fit that you
should have the satisfaction of knowing it   i do not want to say
more than is necessary  i am too much ashamed of having given way
as i have done  and i dare say you understand me  

 yes   said emma   i hope i do  

 how i could so long a time be fancying myself        
cried harriet  warmly    it seems like madness   i can see nothing
at all extraordinary in him now   i do not care whether i meet
him or not  except that of the two i had rather not see him  
and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him  but i do
not envy his wife in the least  i neither admire her nor envy her 
as i have done   she is very charming  i dare say  and all that 
but i think her very ill tempered and disagreeable  i shall never forget
her look the other night   however  i assure you  miss woodhouse 
i wish her no evil   no  let them be ever so happy together 
it will not give me another moment s pang   and to convince you
that i have been speaking truth  i am now going to destroy  what i
ought to have destroyed long ago  what i ought never to have kept  
i know that very well  blushing as she spoke    however  now i
will destroy it all  and it is my particular wish to do it
in your presence  that you may see how rational i am grown 
cannot you guess what this parcel holds   said she  with a conscious look 

 not the least in the world   did he ever give you any thing  

 no  i cannot call them gifts  but they are things that i have
valued very much  

she held the parcel towards her  and emma read the words  most 
 precious   treasures  on the top   her curiosity was greatly excited 
harriet unfolded the parcel  and she looked on with impatience 
within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge ware box 
which harriet opened   it was well lined with the softest cotton 
but  excepting the cotton  emma saw only a small piece of court plaister 

 now   said harriet   you  must  recollect  

 no  indeed i do not  

 dear me   i should not have thought it possible you could forget
what passed in this very room about court plaister  one of the very
last times we ever met in it   it was but a very few days before i
had my sore throat  just before mr  and mrs  john knightley came  
i think the very evening   do not you remember his cutting his finger
with your new penknife  and your recommending court plaister   
but  as you had none about you  and knew i had  you desired
me to supply him  and so i took mine out and cut him a piece 
but it was a great deal too large  and he cut it smaller  and kept
playing some time with what was left  before he gave it back to me 
and so then  in my nonsense  i could not help making a treasure of it  
so i put it by never to be used  and looked at it now and then
as a great treat  

 my dearest harriet   cried emma  putting her hand before her face 
and jumping up   you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear 
remember it   aye  i remember it all now  all  except your saving
this relic  i knew nothing of that till this moment  but the cutting
the finger  and my recommending court plaister  and saying i had none
about me   oh  my sins  my sins   and i had plenty all the while in
my pocket   one of my senseless tricks   i deserve to be under a
continual blush all the rest of my life   well   sitting down again   
go on  what else  

 and had you really some at hand yourself   i am sure i never
suspected it  you did it so naturally  

 and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake  
said emma  recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided
between wonder and amusement   and secretly she added to herself 
 lord bless me  when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton
a piece of court plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about 
i never was equal to this  

 here   resumed harriet  turning to her box again   here is
something still more valuable  i mean that  has   been  more valuable 
because this is what did really once belong to him  which the
court plaister never did  

emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure   it was the end
of an old pencil   the part without any lead 

 this was really his   said harriet    do not you remember
one morning   no  i dare say you do not   but one morning  i forget
exactly the day  but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before
 that   evening   he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book 
it was about spruce beer  mr  knightley had been telling him
something about brewing spruce beer  and he wanted to put it down 
but when he took out his pencil  there was so little lead that he
soon cut it all away  and it would not do  so you lent him another 
and this was left upon the table as good for nothing   but i kept
my eye on it  and  as soon as i dared  caught it up  and never
parted with it again from that moment  

 i do remember it   cried emma   i perfectly remember it   
talking about spruce beer   oh  yes  mr  knightley and i both saying we
liked it  and mr  elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too 
i perfectly remember it   stop  mr  knightley was standing just here 
was not he   i have an idea he was standing just here  

 ah   i do not know   i cannot recollect   it is very odd 
but i cannot recollect   mr  elton was sitting here  i remember 
much about where i am now    

 well  go on  

 oh  that s all   i have nothing more to shew you  or to say  
except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire 
and i wish you to see me do it  

 my poor dear harriet  and have you actually found happiness
in treasuring up these things  

 yes  simpleton as i was   but i am quite ashamed of it now  and wish
i could forget as easily as i can burn them   it was very wrong
of me  you know  to keep any remembrances  after he was married 
i knew it was  but had not resolution enough to part with them  

 but  harriet  is it necessary to burn the court plaister   i have
not a word to say for the bit of old pencil  but the court plaister
might be useful  

 i shall be happier to burn it   replied harriet    it has
a disagreeable look to me   i must get rid of every thing   
there it goes  and there is an end  thank heaven  of mr  elton  

 and when   thought emma   will there be a beginning of mr  churchill  

she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was
already made  and could not but hope that the gipsy  though she had
 told  no fortune  might be proved to have made harriet s   about a
fortnight after the alarm  they came to a sufficient explanation 
and quite undesignedly   emma was not thinking of it at the moment 
which made the information she received more valuable 
she merely said  in the course of some trivial chat   well  harriet 
whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so   and thought
no more of it  till after a minute s silence she heard harriet
say in a very serious tone   i shall never marry  

emma then looked up  and immediately saw how it was  and after a
moment s debate  as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not  replied 

 never marry   this is a new resolution  

 it is one that i shall never change  however  

after another short hesitation   i hope it does not proceed from  
i hope it is not in compliment to mr  elton  

 mr  elton indeed   cried harriet indignantly    oh  no   and emma
could just catch the words   so superior to mr  elton  

she then took a longer time for consideration   should she proceed
no farther   should she let it pass  and seem to suspect nothing   
perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did 
or perhaps if she were totally silent  it might only drive
harriet into asking her to hear too much  and against any thing
like such an unreserve as had been  such an open and frequent
discussion of hopes and chances  she was perfectly resolved   
she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once 
all that she meant to say and know   plain dealing was always best 
she had previously determined how far she would proceed 
on any application of the sort  and it would be safer for both 
to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed   
she was decided  and thus spoke  

 harriet  i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning 
your resolution  or rather your expectation of never marrying 
results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer 
would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you 
is not it so  

 oh   miss woodhouse  believe me i have not the presumption to suppose  
indeed i am not so mad   but it is a pleasure to me to admire him
at a distance  and to think of his infinite superiority to all
the rest of the world  with the gratitude  wonder  and veneration 
which are so proper  in me especially  

 i am not at all surprized at you  harriet   the service he rendered
you was enough to warm your heart  

 service  oh  it was such an inexpressible obligation   
the very recollection of it  and all that i felt at the time  
when i saw him coming  his noble look  and my wretchedness before 
such a change   in one moment such a change   from perfect misery
to perfect happiness  

 it is very natural   it is natural  and it is honourable   
yes  honourable  i think  to chuse so well and so gratefully   
but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise 
i do not advise you to give way to it  harriet   i do not by any
means engage for its being returned   consider what you are about 
perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can 
at any rate do not let them carry you far  unless you are persuaded
of his liking you   be observant of him   let his behaviour be the
guide of your sensations   i give you this caution now  because i
shall never speak to you again on the subject   i am determined
against all interference   henceforward i know nothing of the matter 
let no name ever pass our lips   we were very wrong before 
we will be cautious now   he is your superior  no doubt  and there
do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature 
but yet  harriet  more wonderful things have taken place  there have
been matches of greater disparity   but take care of yourself 
i would not have you too sanguine  though  however it may end 
be assured your raising your thoughts to  him   is a mark of good taste
which i shall always know how to value  

harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude 
emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing
for her friend   its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind  
and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation 



chapter v


in this state of schemes  and hopes  and connivance  june opened
upon hartfield   to highbury in general it brought no material change 
the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings 
and of the use to be made of their barouche landau  and jane fairfax
was still at her grandmother s  and as the return of the campbells
from ireland was again delayed  and august  instead of midsummer 
fixed for it  she was likely to remain there full two months longer 
provided at least she were able to defeat mrs  elton s activity
in her service  and save herself from being hurried into a delightful
situation against her will 

mr  knightley  who  for some reason best known to himself  had certainly
taken an early dislike to frank churchill  was only growing to dislike
him more   he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his
pursuit of emma   that emma was his object appeared indisputable 
every thing declared it  his own attentions  his father s hints 
his mother in law s guarded silence  it was all in unison 
words  conduct  discretion  and indiscretion  told the same story 
but while so many were devoting him to emma  and emma herself making him
over to harriet  mr  knightley began to suspect him of some inclination
to trifle with jane fairfax   he could not understand it  but there
were symptoms of intelligence between them  he thought so at least  
symptoms of admiration on his side  which  having once observed 
he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning 
however he might wish to escape any of emma s errors of imagination 
 she  was not present when the suspicion first arose   he was dining
with the randalls family  and jane  at the eltons   and he had
seen a look  more than a single look  at miss fairfax  which 
from the admirer of miss woodhouse  seemed somewhat out of place 
when he was again in their company  he could not help remembering
what he had seen  nor could he avoid observations which  unless it
were like cowper and his fire at twilight 

 myself creating what i saw  

brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something
of private liking  of private understanding even  between frank
churchill and jane 

he had walked up one day after dinner  as he very often did 
to spend his evening at hartfield   emma and harriet were going
to walk  he joined them  and  on returning  they fell in with a
larger party  who  like themselves  judged it wisest to take their
exercise early  as the weather threatened rain  mr  and mrs  weston
and their son  miss bates and her niece  who had accidentally met 
they all united  and  on reaching hartfield gates  emma  who knew it
was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father 
pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him   the randalls
party agreed to it immediately  and after a pretty long speech
from miss bates  which few persons listened to  she also found it
possible to accept dear miss woodhouse s most obliging invitation 

as they were turning into the grounds  mr  perry passed by on horseback 
the gentlemen spoke of his horse 

 by the bye   said frank churchill to mrs  weston presently 
 what became of mr  perry s plan of setting up his carriage  

mrs  weston looked surprized  and said   i did not know that he
ever had any such plan  

 nay  i had it from you   you wrote me word of it three months ago  

 me  impossible  

 indeed you did   i remember it perfectly   you mentioned it as
what was certainly to be very soon   mrs  perry had told somebody 
and was extremely happy about it   it was owing to  her  persuasion 
as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal
of harm   you must remember it now  

 upon my word i never heard of it till this moment  

 never  really  never   bless me  how could it be   then i must
have dreamt it  but i was completely persuaded  miss smith 
you walk as if you were tired   you will not be sorry to find
yourself at home  

 what is this   what is this   cried mr  weston   about perry
and a carriage   is perry going to set up his carriage  frank 
i am glad he can afford it   you had it from himself  had you  

 no  sir   replied his son  laughing   i seem to have had it
from nobody   very odd   i really was persuaded of mrs  weston s
having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe  many weeks ago 
with all these particulars  but as she declares she never heard
a syllable of it before  of course it must have been a dream   i am
a great dreamer   i dream of every body at highbury when i am away  
and when i have gone through my particular friends  then i begin
dreaming of mr  and mrs  perry  

 it is odd though   observed his father   that you should have had such
a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you
should be thinking of at enscombe   perry s setting up his carriage 
and his wife s persuading him to it  out of care for his health  
just what will happen  i have no doubt  some time or other 
only a little premature   what an air of probability sometimes
runs through a dream   and at others  what a heap of absurdities
it is   well  frank  your dream certainly shews that highbury is in
your thoughts when you are absent   emma  you are a great dreamer 
i think  

emma was out of hearing   she had hurried on before her guests
to prepare her father for their appearance  and was beyond the reach
of mr  weston s hint 

 why  to own the truth   cried miss bates  who had been trying in vain
to be heard the last two minutes   if i must speak on this subject 
there is no denying that mr  frank churchill might have  i do not
mean to say that he did not dream it  i am sure i have sometimes
the oddest dreams in the world  but if i am questioned about it 
i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring 
for mrs  perry herself mentioned it to my mother  and the coles
knew of it as well as ourselves  but it was quite a secret 
known to nobody else  and only thought of about three days 
mrs  perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage  and came
to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she
had prevailed   jane  don t you remember grandmama s telling us
of it when we got home   i forget where we had been walking to  
very likely to randalls  yes  i think it was to randalls 
mrs  perry was always particularly fond of my mother  indeed i do
not know who is not  and she had mentioned it to her in confidence 
she had no objection to her telling us  of course  but it was not
to go beyond   and  from that day to this  i never mentioned it
to a soul that i know of   at the same time  i will not positively
answer for my having never dropt a hint  because i know i do
sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware   i am a talker 
you know  i am rather a talker  and now and then i have let a thing
escape me which i should not   i am not like jane  i wish i were 
i will answer for it  she  never betrayed the least thing in the world 
where is she   oh  just behind   perfectly remember mrs  perry s coming   
extraordinary dream  indeed  

they were entering the hall   mr  knightley s eyes had preceded
miss bates s in a glance at jane   from frank churchill s face 
where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away 
he had involuntarily turned to hers  but she was indeed behind 
and too busy with her shawl   mr  weston had walked in   the two
other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass   mr  knightley
suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye  
he seemed watching her intently  in vain  however  if it were so  
jane passed between them into the hall  and looked at neither 

there was no time for farther remark or explanation   the dream must
be borne with  and mr  knightley must take his seat with the rest round
the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield 
and which none but emma could have had power to place there and
persuade her father to use  instead of the small sized pembroke 
on which two of his daily meals had  for forty years been crowded 
tea passed pleasantly  and nobody seemed in a hurry to move 

 miss woodhouse   said frank churchill  after examining a table
behind him  which he could reach as he sat   have your nephews taken
away their alphabets  their box of letters   it used to stand here 
where is it   this is a sort of dull looking evening  that ought
to be treated rather as winter than summer   we had great amusement
with those letters one morning   i want to puzzle you again  

emma was pleased with the thought  and producing the box  the table
was quickly scattered over with alphabets  which no one seemed so much
disposed to employ as their two selves   they were rapidly forming
words for each other  or for any body else who would be puzzled 
the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for
mr  woodhouse  who had often been distressed by the more animated sort 
which mr  weston had occasionally introduced  and who now sat happily
occupied in lamenting  with tender melancholy  over the departure
of the  poor little boys   or in fondly pointing out  as he took
up any stray letter near him  how beautifully emma had written it 

frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax   she gave
a slight glance round the table  and applied herself to it 
frank was next to emma  jane opposite to them  and mr  knightley
so placed as to see them all  and it was his object to see as much
as he could  with as little apparent observation   the word
was discovered  and with a faint smile pushed away   if meant
to be immediately mixed with the others  and buried from sight 
she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across 
for it was not mixed  and harriet  eager after every fresh word 
and finding out none  directly took it up  and fell to work 
she was sitting by mr  knightley  and turned to him for help 
the word was  blunder   and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it 
there was a blush on jane s cheek which gave it a meaning not
otherwise ostensible   mr  knightley connected it with the dream 
but how it could all be  was beyond his comprehension 
how the delicacy  the discretion of his favourite could have been
so lain asleep   he feared there must be some decided involvement 
disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn 
these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick 
it was a child s play  chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank
churchill s part 

with great indignation did he continue to observe him  with great
alarm and distrust  to observe also his two blinded companions 
he saw a short word prepared for emma  and given to her with a look
sly and demure   he saw that emma had soon made it out  and found
it highly entertaining  though it was something which she judged it
proper to appear to censure  for she said   nonsense  for shame  
he heard frank churchill next say  with a glance towards jane 
 i will give it to her  shall i    and as clearly heard emma
opposing it with eager laughing warmth    no  no  you must not 
you shall not  indeed  

it was done however   this gallant young man  who seemed to love
without feeling  and to recommend himself without complaisance 
directly handed over the word to miss fairfax  and with a particular
degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it   mr  knightley s
excessive curiosity to know what this word might be  made him seize
every possible moment for darting his eye towards it  and it was
not long before he saw it to be  dixon    jane fairfax s perception
seemed to accompany his  her comprehension was certainly more equal
to the covert meaning  the superior intelligence  of those five letters
so arranged   she was evidently displeased  looked up  and seeing
herself watched  blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her 
and saying only   i did not know that proper names were allowed  
pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit  and looked
resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered 
her face was averted from those who had made the attack  and turned
towards her aunt 

 aye  very true  my dear   cried the latter  though jane had not
spoken a word   i was just going to say the same thing   it is time
for us to be going indeed   the evening is closing in  and grandmama
will be looking for us   my dear sir  you are too obliging 
we really must wish you good night  

jane s alertness in moving  proved her as ready as her aunt
had preconceived   she was immediately up  and wanting to quit
the table  but so many were also moving  that she could not get away 
and mr  knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously
pushed towards her  and resolutely swept away by her unexamined 
she was afterwards looking for her shawl  frank churchill was
looking also  it was growing dusk  and the room was in confusion 
and how they parted  mr  knightley could not tell 

he remained at hartfield after all the rest  his thoughts full
of what he had seen  so full  that when the candles came to assist
his observations  he must  yes  he certainly must  as a friend  
an anxious friend  give emma some hint  ask her some question 
he could not see her in a situation of such danger  without trying to
preserve her   it was his duty 

 pray  emma   said he   may i ask in what lay the great amusement 
the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax 
i saw the word  and am curious to know how it could be so very
entertaining to the one  and so very distressing to the other  

emma was extremely confused   she could not endure to give him the
true explanation  for though her suspicions were by no means removed 
she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them 

 oh   she cried in evident embarrassment   it all meant nothing 
a mere joke among ourselves  

 the joke   he replied gravely   seemed confined to you
and mr  churchill  

he had hoped she would speak again  but she did not   she would
rather busy herself about any thing than speak   he sat a little
while in doubt   a variety of evils crossed his mind   interference  
fruitless interference   emma s confusion  and the acknowledged intimacy 
seemed to declare her affection engaged   yet he would speak 
he owed it to her  to risk any thing that might be involved in
an unwelcome interference  rather than her welfare  to encounter
any thing  rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause 

 my dear emma   said he at last  with earnest kindness   do you
think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between
the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of  

 between mr  frank churchill and miss fairfax   oh  yes  perfectly   
why do you make a doubt of it  

 have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her 
or that she admired him  

 never  never   she cried with a most open eagerness   never  for
the twentieth part of a moment  did such an idea occur to me 
and how could it possibly come into your head  

 i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them  
certain expressive looks  which i did not believe meant to be public  

 oh  you amuse me excessively   i am delighted to find that you
can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander  but it will not do  
very sorry to check you in your first essay  but indeed it will
not do   there is no admiration between them  i do assure you 
and the appearances which have caught you  have arisen from some
peculiar circumstances  feelings rather of a totally different nature  
it is impossible exactly to explain   there is a good deal of
nonsense in it  but the part which is capable of being communicated 
which is sense  is  that they are as far from any attachment or
admiration for one another  as any two beings in the world can be 
that is  i  presume  it to be so on her side  and i can  answer  for its
being so on his   i will answer for the gentleman s indifference  

she spoke with a confidence which staggered  with a satisfaction
which silenced  mr  knightley   she was in gay spirits  and would
have prolonged the conversation  wanting to hear the particulars
of his suspicions  every look described  and all the wheres and hows
of a circumstance which highly entertained her   but his gaiety did
not meet hers   he found he could not be useful  and his feelings
were too much irritated for talking   that he might not be irritated
into an absolute fever  by the fire which mr  woodhouse s tender
habits required almost every evening throughout the year  he soon
afterwards took a hasty leave  and walked home to the coolness
and solitude of donwell abbey 



chapter vi


after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr  and
mrs  suckling  the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification
of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn 
no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores
at present   in the daily interchange of news  they must be again
restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings 
coming had been united  such as the last accounts of mrs  churchill 
whose health seemed every day to supply a different report 
and the situation of mrs  weston  whose happiness it was to be hoped
might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child 
as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it 

mrs  elton was very much disappointed   it was the delay of a great
deal of pleasure and parade   her introductions and recommendations
must all wait  and every projected party be still only talked of 
so she thought at first   but a little consideration convinced
her that every thing need not be put off   why should not they
explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come   they could
go there again with them in the autumn   it was settled that they
should go to box hill   that there was to be such a party had been
long generally known   it had even given the idea of another 
emma had never been to box hill  she wished to see what every body
found so well worth seeing  and she and mr  weston had agreed
to chuse some fine morning and drive thither   two or three more
of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them  and it was to
be done in a quiet  unpretending  elegant way  infinitely superior
to the bustle and preparation  the regular eating and drinking 
and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings 

this was so very well understood between them  that emma could
not but feel some surprise  and a little displeasure  on hearing
from mr  weston that he had been proposing to mrs  elton  as her
brother and sister had failed her  that the two parties should unite 
and go together  and that as mrs  elton had very readily acceded
to it  so it was to be  if she had no objection   now  as her
objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs  elton 
of which mr  weston must already be perfectly aware  it was not worth
bringing forward again   it could not be done without a reproof
to him  which would be giving pain to his wife  and she found
herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she
would have done a great deal to avoid  an arrangement which would
probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of
mrs  elton s party   every feeling was offended  and the forbearance
of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity
in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr  weston s temper 

 i am glad you approve of what i have done   said he very comfortably 
 but i thought you would   such schemes as these are nothing
without numbers   one cannot have too large a party   a large party
secures its own amusement   and she is a good natured woman after all 
one could not leave her out  

emma denied none of it aloud  and agreed to none of it in private 

it was now the middle of june  and the weather fine  and mrs  elton
was growing impatient to name the day  and settle with mr  weston
as to pigeon pies and cold lamb  when a lame carriage horse threw
every thing into sad uncertainty   it might be weeks  it might be
only a few days  before the horse were useable  but no preparations
could be ventured on  and it was all melancholy stagnation 
mrs  elton s resources were inadequate to such an attack 

 is not this most vexations  knightley   she cried    and such weather
for exploring   these delays and disappointments are quite odious 
what are we to do   the year will wear away at this rate 
and nothing done   before this time last year i assure you we had
had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston  

 you had better explore to donwell   replied mr  knightley 
 that may be done without horses   come  and eat my strawberries 
they are ripening fast  

if mr  knightley did not begin seriously  he was obliged to proceed so 
for his proposal was caught at with delight  and the  oh   i should
like it of all things   was not plainer in words than manner 
donwell was famous for its strawberry beds  which seemed a plea for
the invitation   but no plea was necessary  cabbage beds would have
been enough to tempt the lady  who only wanted to be going somewhere 
she promised him again and again to come  much oftener than
he doubted  and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy 
such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it 

 you may depend upon me   said she    i certainly will come 
name your day  and i will come   you will allow me to bring
jane fairfax  

 i cannot name a day   said he   till i have spoken to some others
whom i would wish to meet you  

 oh  leave all that to me   only give me a carte blanche   i am
lady patroness  you know   it is my party   i will bring friends
with me  

 i hope you will bring elton   said he    but i will not trouble
you to give any other invitations  

 oh  now you are looking very sly   but consider  you need not be afraid
of delegating power to  me    i am no young lady on her preferment 
married women  you know  may be safely authorised   it is my party 
leave it all to me   i will invite your guests  

 no    he calmly replied    there is but one married woman in the world
whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell 
and that one is   

   mrs  weston  i suppose   interrupted mrs  elton  rather mortified 

 no  mrs  knightley   and till she is in being  i will manage
such matters myself  

 ah  you are an odd creature   she cried  satisfied to have no
one preferred to herself    you are a humourist  and may say what
you like   quite a humourist   well  i shall bring jane with me  
jane and her aunt   the rest i leave to you   i have no objections
at all to meeting the hartfield family   don t scruple   i know
you are attached to them  

 you certainly will meet them if i can prevail  and i shall call
on miss bates in my way home  

 that s quite unnecessary  i see jane every day   but as you like 
it is to be a morning scheme  you know  knightley  quite a simple thing 
i shall wear a large bonnet  and bring one of my little baskets
hanging on my arm   here   probably this basket with pink ribbon 
nothing can be more simple  you see   and jane will have such another 
there is to be no form or parade  a sort of gipsy party   we are
to walk about your gardens  and gather the strawberries ourselves 
and sit under trees   and whatever else you may like to provide 
it is to be all out of doors  a table spread in the shade  you know 
every thing as natural and simple as possible   is not that your idea  

 not quite   my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have
the table spread in the dining room  the nature and the simplicity
of gentlemen and ladies  with their servants and furniture  i think
is best observed by meals within doors   when you are tired of eating
strawberries in the garden  there shall be cold meat in the house  

 well  as you please  only don t have a great set out   and  by the bye 
can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion   
pray be sincere  knightley   if you wish me to talk to mrs  hodges 
or to inspect anything   

 i have not the least wish for it  i thank you  

 well  but if any difficulties should arise  my housekeeper
is extremely clever  

 i will answer for it  that mine thinks herself full as clever 
and would spurn any body s assistance  

 i wish we had a donkey   the thing would be for us all to come
on donkeys  jane  miss bates  and me  and my caro sposo walking by 
i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey   in a country
life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary  for  let a woman have
ever so many resources  it is not possible for her to be always shut
up at home   and very long walks  you know  in summer there is dust 
and in winter there is dirt  

 you will not find either  between donwell and highbury 
donwell lane is never dusty  and now it is perfectly dry   come on
a donkey  however  if you prefer it   you can borrow mrs  cole s 
i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible  

 that i am sure you would   indeed i do you justice  my good friend 
under that peculiar sort of dry  blunt manner  i know you have the
warmest heart   as i tell mr  e   you are a thorough humourist   
yes  believe me  knightley  i am fully sensible of your attention
to me in the whole of this scheme   you have hit upon the very thing
to please me  

mr  knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade 
he wished to persuade mr  woodhouse  as well as emma  to join the party 
and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors
to eat would inevitably make him ill   mr  woodhouse must not 
under the specious pretence of a morning drive  and an hour or two
spent at donwell  be tempted away to his misery 

he was invited on good faith   no lurking horrors were to upbraid
him for his easy credulity   he did consent   he had not been
at donwell for two years    some very fine morning  he  and emma 
and harriet  could go very well  and he could sit still with
mrs  weston  while the dear girls walked about the gardens 
he did not suppose they could be damp now  in the middle of
the day   he should like to see the old house again exceedingly 
and should be very happy to meet mr  and mrs  elton  and any other
of his neighbours   he could not see any objection at all to his 
and emma s  and harriet s going there some very fine morning 
he thought it very well done of mr  knightley to invite them  
very kind and sensible  much cleverer than dining out   he was not
fond of dining out  

mr  knightley was fortunate in every body s most ready concurrence 
the invitation was everywhere so well received  that it seemed as if 
like mrs  elton  they were all taking the scheme as a particular
compliment to themselves   emma and harriet professed very high
expectations of pleasure from it  and mr  weston  unasked 
promised to get frank over to join them  if possible  a proof
of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with   
mr  knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad
to see him  and mr  weston engaged to lose no time in writing 
and spare no arguments to induce him to come 

in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast  that the party
to box hill was again under happy consideration  and at last donwell
was settled for one day  and box hill for the next   the weather
appearing exactly right 

under a bright mid day sun  at almost midsummer  mr  woodhouse
was safely conveyed in his carriage  with one window down 
to partake of this al fresco party  and in one of the most
comfortable rooms in the abbey  especially prepared for him by a
fire all the morning  he was happily placed  quite at his ease 
ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved  and advise
every body to come and sit down  and not to heat themselves   
mrs  weston  who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired 
and sit all the time with him  remained  when all the others
were invited or persuaded out  his patient listener and sympathiser 

it was so long since emma had been at the abbey  that as soon as she
was satisfied of her father s comfort  she was glad to leave him 
and look around her  eager to refresh and correct her memory with
more particular observation  more exact understanding of a house
and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family 

she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance
with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant 
as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building 
its suitable  becoming  characteristic situation  low and sheltered  
its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream 
of which the abbey  with all the old neglect of prospect 
had scarcely a sight  and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues 
which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up   the house
was larger than hartfield  and totally unlike it  covering a good
deal of ground  rambling and irregular  with many comfortable 
and one or two handsome rooms   it was just what it ought to be 
and it looked what it was  and emma felt an increasing respect
for it  as the residence of a family of such true gentility 
untainted in blood and understanding   some faults of temper john
knightley had  but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably 
she had given them neither men  nor names  nor places  that could
raise a blush   these were pleasant feelings  and she walked about
and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did 
and collect round the strawberry beds   the whole party were assembled 
excepting frank churchill  who was expected every moment from richmond 
and mrs  elton  in all her apparatus of happiness  her large bonnet
and her basket  was very ready to lead the way in gathering 
accepting  or talking  strawberries  and only strawberries 
could now be thought or spoken of    the best fruit in england  
every body s favourite  always wholesome   these the finest beds
and finest sorts   delightful to gather for one s self  the only way
of really enjoying them   morning decidedly the best time  never tired  
every sort good  hautboy infinitely superior  no comparison  
the others hardly eatable  hautboys very scarce  chili preferred  
white wood finest flavour of all  price of strawberries in london  
abundance about bristol  maple grove  cultivation  beds when to
be renewed  gardeners thinking exactly different  no general rule  
gardeners never to be put out of their way  delicious fruit  
only too rich to be eaten much of  inferior to cherries  
currants more refreshing  only objection to gathering strawberries
the stooping  glaring sun  tired to death  could bear it no longer  
must go and sit in the shade  

such  for half an hour  was the conversation  interrupted only
once by mrs  weston  who came out  in her solicitude after her
son in law  to inquire if he were come  and she was a little uneasy   
she had some fears of his horse 

seats tolerably in the shade were found  and now emma was obliged
to overhear what mrs  elton and jane fairfax were talking of   
a situation  a most desirable situation  was in question   mrs  elton
had received notice of it that morning  and was in raptures 
it was not with mrs  suckling  it was not with mrs  bragge 
but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them   it was
with a cousin of mrs  bragge  an acquaintance of mrs  suckling 
a lady known at maple grove   delightful  charming  superior 
first circles  spheres  lines  ranks  every thing  and mrs  elton
was wild to have the offer closed with immediately   on her side 
all was warmth  energy  and triumph  and she positively refused
to take her friend s negative  though miss fairfax continued
to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing 
repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before   
still mrs  elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence
by the morrow s post   how jane could bear it at all  was astonishing
to emma   she did look vexed  she did speak pointedly  and at last 
with a decision of action unusual to her  proposed a removal   
 should not they walk   would not mr  knightley shew them the gardens  
all the gardens   she wished to see the whole extent    the pertinacity
of her friend seemed more than she could bear 

it was hot  and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered 
dispersed way  scarcely any three together  they insensibly
followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short
avenue of limes  which stretching beyond the garden at an equal
distance from the river  seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds   
it led to nothing  nothing but a view at the end over a low stone
wall with high pillars  which seemed intended  in their erection 
to give the appearance of an approach to the house  which never had
been there   disputable  however  as might be the taste of such
a termination  it was in itself a charming walk  and the view
which closed it extremely pretty   the considerable slope  at nearly
the foot of which the abbey stood  gradually acquired a steeper
form beyond its grounds  and at half a mile distant was a bank
of considerable abruptness and grandeur  well clothed with wood   
and at the bottom of this bank  favourably placed and sheltered 
rose the abbey mill farm  with meadows in front  and the river
making a close and handsome curve around it 

it was a sweet view  sweet to the eye and the mind   english verdure 
english culture  english comfort  seen under a sun bright 
without being oppressive 

in this walk emma and mr  weston found all the others assembled 
and towards this view she immediately perceived mr  knightley
and harriet distinct from the rest  quietly leading the way 
mr  knightley and harriet   it was an odd tete a tete  but she was
glad to see it   there had been a time when he would have scorned
her as a companion  and turned from her with little ceremony 
now they seemed in pleasant conversation   there had been a time
also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot
so favourable for the abbey mill farm  but now she feared it not 
it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity
and beauty  its rich pastures  spreading flocks  orchard in blossom 
and light column of smoke ascending   she joined them at the wall 
and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around 
he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture  etc 
and emma received a smile which seemed to say   these are my
own concerns   i have a right to talk on such subjects  without being
suspected of introducing robert martin    she did not suspect him 
it was too old a story   robert martin had probably ceased to think
of harriet   they took a few turns together along the walk   the shade
was most refreshing  and emma found it the pleasantest part of
the day 

the next remove was to the house  they must all go in and eat   
and they were all seated and busy  and still frank churchill did
not come   mrs  weston looked  and looked in vain   his father would
not own himself uneasy  and laughed at her fears  but she could
not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare 
he had expressed himself as to coming  with more than common certainty 
 his aunt was so much better  that he had not a doubt of getting
over to them    mrs  churchill s state  however  as many were ready
to remind her  was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint
her nephew in the most reasonable dependence  and mrs  weston
was at last persuaded to believe  or to say  that it must be
by some attack of mrs  churchill that he was prevented coming   
emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration 
she behaved very well  and betrayed no emotion 

the cold repast was over  and the party were to go out once more
to see what had not yet been seen  the old abbey fish ponds 
perhaps get as far as the clover  which was to be begun cutting
on the morrow  or  at any rate  have the pleasure of being hot 
and growing cool again   mr  woodhouse  who had already taken
his little round in the highest part of the gardens  where no
damps from the river were imagined even by him  stirred no more 
and his daughter resolved to remain with him  that mrs  weston
might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety
which her spirits seemed to need 

mr  knightley had done all in his power for mr  woodhouse s
entertainment   books of engravings  drawers of medals  cameos 
corals  shells  and every other family collection within his cabinets 
had been prepared for his old friend  to while away the morning 
and the kindness had perfectly answered   mr  woodhouse had been
exceedingly well amused   mrs  weston had been shewing them all to him 
and now he would shew them all to emma   fortunate in having no other
resemblance to a child  than in a total want of taste for what he saw 
for he was slow  constant  and methodical   before this second looking
over was begun  however  emma walked into the hall for the sake
of a few moments  free observation of the entrance and ground plot
of the house  and was hardly there  when jane fairfax appeared 
coming quickly in from the garden  and with a look of escape   
little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon  there was a start
at first  but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of 

 will you be so kind   said she   when i am missed  as to say
that i am gone home   i am going this moment   my aunt is not aware
how late it is  nor how long we have been absent  but i am sure we
shall be wanted  and i am determined to go directly   i have said
nothing about it to any body   it would only be giving trouble
and distress   some are gone to the ponds  and some to the lime walk 
till they all come in i shall not be missed  and when they do 
will you have the goodness to say that i am gone  

 certainly  if you wish it   but you are not going to walk
to highbury alone  

 yes  what should hurt me   i walk fast   i shall be at home
in twenty minutes  

 but it is too far  indeed it is  to be walking quite alone 
let my father s servant go with you   let me order the carriage 
it can be round in five minutes  

 thank you  thank you  but on no account   i would rather walk   
and for  me  to be afraid of walking alone   i  who may so soon have
to guard others  

she spoke with great agitation  and emma very feelingly replied 
 that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now 
i must order the carriage   the heat even would be danger   you are
fatigued already  

 i am    she answered   i am fatigued  but it is not the sort
of fatigue  quick walking will refresh me   miss woodhouse  we all
know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits   mine  i confess 
are exhausted   the greatest kindness you can shew me  will be to let
me have my own way  and only say that i am gone when it is necessary  

emma had not another word to oppose   she saw it all  and entering
into her feelings  promoted her quitting the house immediately 
and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend   her parting
look was grateful  and her parting words   oh   miss woodhouse 
the comfort of being sometimes alone    seemed to burst from
an overcharged heart  and to describe somewhat of the continual
endurance to be practised by her  even towards some of those who
loved her best 

 such a home  indeed  such an aunt   said emma  as she turned back
into the hall again    i do pity you   and the more sensibility
you betray of their just horrors  the more i shall like you  

jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour  and they had only
accomplished some views of st  mark s place  venice  when frank
churchill entered the room   emma had not been thinking of him 
she had forgotten to think of him  but she was very glad to see him 
mrs  weston would be at ease   the black mare was blameless 
 they  were right who had named mrs  churchill as the cause 
he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her 
a nervous seizure  which had lasted some hours  and he had quite given
up every thought of coming  till very late   and had he known how hot
a ride he should have  and how late  with all his hurry  he must be 
he believed he should not have come at all   the heat was excessive 
he had never suffered any thing like it  almost wished he had staid
at home  nothing killed him like heat  he could bear any degree of cold 
etc   but heat was intolerable  and he sat down  at the greatest
possible distance from the slight remains of mr  woodhouse s fire 
looking very deplorable 

 you will soon be cooler  if you sit still   said emma 

 as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again   i could very
ill be spared  but such a point had been made of my coming 
you will all be going soon i suppose  the whole party breaking up 
i met  one  as i came  madness in such weather   absolute madness  

emma listened  and looked  and soon perceived that frank churchill s
state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being
out of humour   some people were always cross when they were hot 
such might be his constitution  and as she knew that eating
and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints 
she recommended his taking some refreshment  he would find abundance
of every thing in the dining room  and she humanely pointed out
the door 

 no  he should not eat   he was not hungry  it would only make
him hotter    in two minutes  however  he relented in his own favour 
and muttering something about spruce beer  walked off   emma returned
all her attention to her father  saying in secret  

 i am glad i have done being in love with him   i should not like a
man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning   harriet s sweet
easy temper will not mind it  

he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal  and came
back all the better  grown quite cool  and  with good manners 
like himself  able to draw a chair close to them  take an interest
in their employment  and regret  in a reasonable way  that he
should be so late   he was not in his best spirits  but seemed
trying to improve them  and  at last  made himself talk nonsense
very agreeably   they were looking over views in swisserland 

 as soon as my aunt gets well  i shall go abroad   said he 
 i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places 
you will have my sketches  some time or other  to look at  or my tour
to read  or my poem   i shall do something to expose myself  

 that may be  but not by sketches in swisserland   you will
never go to swisserland   your uncle and aunt will never allow
you to leave england  

 they may be induced to go too   a warm climate may be prescribed
for her   i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad 
i assure you i have   i feel a strong persuasion  this morning 
that i shall soon be abroad   i ought to travel   i am tired
of doing nothing   i want a change   i am serious  miss woodhouse 
whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy  i am sick of england  
and would leave it to morrow  if i could  

 you are sick of prosperity and indulgence   cannot you invent
a few hardships for yourself  and be contented to stay  

  i  sick of prosperity and indulgence   you are quite mistaken 
i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged   i am
thwarted in every thing material   i do not consider myself at all
a fortunate person  

 you are not quite so miserable  though  as when you first came 
go and eat and drink a little more  and you will do very well 
another slice of cold meat  another draught of madeira and water 
will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us  

 no  i shall not stir   i shall sit by you   you are my best cure  

 we are going to box hill to morrow   you will join us 
it is not swisserland  but it will be something for a young
man so much in want of a change   you will stay  and go with us  

 no  certainly not  i shall go home in the cool of the evening  

 but you may come again in the cool of to morrow morning  

 no  it will not be worth while   if i come  i shall be cross  

 then pray stay at richmond  

 but if i do  i shall be crosser still   i can never bear to think
of you all there without me  

 these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself 
chuse your own degree of crossness   i shall press you no more  

the rest of the party were now returning  and all were soon collected 
with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill 
others took it very composedly  but there was a very general distress
and disturbance on miss fairfax s disappearance being explained 
that it was time for every body to go  concluded the subject  and with
a short final arrangement for the next day s scheme  they parted 
frank churchill s little inclination to exclude himself increased
so much  that his last words to emma were 

 well   if  you  wish me to stay and join the party  i will  

she smiled her acceptance  and nothing less than a summons from
richmond was to take him back before the following evening 



chapter vii


they had a very fine day for box hill  and all the other outward
circumstances of arrangement  accommodation  and punctuality 
were in favour of a pleasant party   mr  weston directed the whole 
officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage  and every
body was in good time   emma and harriet went together  miss bates
and her niece  with the eltons  the gentlemen on horseback 
mrs  weston remained with mr  woodhouse   nothing was wanting
but to be happy when they got there   seven miles were travelled
in expectation of enjoyment  and every body had a burst of admiration
on first arriving  but in the general amount of the day there
was deficiency   there was a languor  a want of spirits  a want of union 
which could not be got over   they separated too much into parties 
the eltons walked together  mr  knightley took charge of miss
bates and jane  and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill 
and mr  weston tried  in vain  to make them harmonise better   it seemed
at first an accidental division  but it never materially varied 
mr  and mrs  elton  indeed  shewed no unwillingness to mix 
and be as agreeable as they could  but during the two whole hours
that were spent on the hill  there seemed a principle of separation 
between the other parties  too strong for any fine prospects  or any
cold collation  or any cheerful mr  weston  to remove 

at first it was downright dulness to emma   she had never seen frank
churchill so silent and stupid   he said nothing worth hearing  
looked without seeing  admired without intelligence  listened without
knowing what she said   while he was so dull  it was no wonder that
harriet should be dull likewise  and they were both insufferable 

when they all sat down it was better  to her taste a great deal better 
for frank churchill grew talkative and gay  making her his first object 
every distinguishing attention that could be paid  was paid to her 
to amuse her  and be agreeable in her eyes  seemed all that he
cared for  and emma  glad to be enlivened  not sorry to be flattered 
was gay and easy too  and gave him all the friendly encouragement 
the admission to be gallant  which she had ever given in the first
and most animating period of their acquaintance  but which now 
in her own estimation  meant nothing  though in the judgment of most
people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english
word but flirtation could very well describe    mr  frank churchill
and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively    they were laying
themselves open to that very phrase  and to having it sent off
in a letter to maple grove by one lady  to ireland by another 
not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity 
it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected 
she laughed because she was disappointed  and though she liked him
for his attentions  and thought them all  whether in friendship 
admiration  or playfulness  extremely judicious  they were not winning
back her heart   she still intended him for her friend 

 how much i am obliged to you   said he   for telling me to come to day   
if it had not been for you  i should certainly have lost all the
happiness of this party   i had quite determined to go away again  

 yes  you were very cross  and i do not know what about 
except that you were too late for the best strawberries 
i was a kinder friend than you deserved   but you were humble 
you begged hard to be commanded to come  

 don t say i was cross   i was fatigued   the heat overcame me  

 it is hotter to day  

 not to my feelings   i am perfectly comfortable to day  

 you are comfortable because you are under command  

 your command   yes  

 perhaps i intended you to say so  but i meant self command  you had 
somehow or other  broken bounds yesterday  and run away from your
own management  but to day you are got back again  and as i cannot
be always with you  it is best to believe your temper under your
own command rather than mine  

 it comes to the same thing   i can have no self command without
a motive   you order me  whether you speak or not   and you can
be always with me   you are always with me  

 dating from three o clock yesterday   my perpetual influence
could not begin earlier  or you would not have been so much
out of humour before  

 three o clock yesterday   that is your date   i thought i had seen
you first in february  

 your gallantry is really unanswerable   but  lowering her voice   
nobody speaks except ourselves  and it is rather too much to be
talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people  

 i say nothing of which i am ashamed   replied he  with lively impudence 
 i saw you first in february   let every body on the hill hear me if
they can   let my accents swell to mickleham on one side  and dorking
on the other   i saw you first in february    and then whispering  
 our companions are excessively stupid   what shall we do to rouse them 
any nonsense will serve   they  shall  talk   ladies and gentlemen 
i am ordered by miss woodhouse  who  wherever she is  presides 
to say  that she desires to know what you are all thinking of  

some laughed  and answered good humouredly  miss bates said a great deal 
mrs  elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse s presiding 
mr  knightley s answer was the most distinct 

 is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are
all thinking of  

 oh  no  no   cried emma  laughing as carelessly as she could  
 upon no account in the world   it is the very last thing i
would stand the brunt of just now   let me hear any thing rather
than what you are all thinking of   i will not say quite all 
there are one or two  perhaps   glancing at mr  weston and harriet  
whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing  

 it is a sort of thing   cried mrs  elton emphatically 
 which  i  should not have thought myself privileged to
inquire into   though  perhaps  as the  chaperon  of the party  
 i  never was in any circle  exploring parties  young ladies  married women   

her mutterings were chiefly to her husband  and he murmured 
in reply 

 very true  my love  very true   exactly so  indeed  quite unheard of  
but some ladies say any thing   better pass it off as a joke 
every body knows what is due to  you   

 it will not do   whispered frank to emma   they are most
of them affronted   i will attack them with more address 
ladies and gentlemen  i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say  that she
waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of 
and only requires something very entertaining from each of you 
in a general way   here are seven of you  besides myself   who  she
is pleased to say  am very entertaining already   and she only
demands from each of you either one thing very clever  be it prose
or verse  original or repeated  or two things moderately clever  
or three things very dull indeed  and she engages to laugh heartily
at them all  

 oh  very well   exclaimed miss bates   then i need not be uneasy 
 three things very dull indeed    that will just do for me  you know 
i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open
my mouth  shan t i   looking round with the most good humoured
dependence on every body s assent   do not you all think i shall  

emma could not resist 

 ah  ma am  but there may be a difficulty   pardon me  but you
will be limited as to number  only three at once  

miss bates  deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner  did not
immediately catch her meaning  but  when it burst on her  it could
not anger  though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her 

 ah   well  to be sure   yes  i see what she means   turning to
mr  knightley   and i will try to hold my tongue   i must make
myself very disagreeable  or she would not have said such a thing
to an old friend  

 i like your plan   cried mr  weston    agreed  agreed   i will do
my best   i am making a conundrum   how will a conundrum reckon  

 low  i am afraid  sir  very low   answered his son    but we shall
be indulgent  especially to any one who leads the way  

 no  no   said emma   it will not reckon low   a conundrum of
mr  weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour   come  sir 
pray let me hear it  

 i doubt its being very clever myself   said mr  weston 
 it is too much a matter of fact  but here it is   what two letters
of the alphabet are there  that express perfection  

 what two letters   express perfection   i am sure i do not know  

 ah  you will never guess   you   to emma   i am certain  will
never guess   i will tell you   m  and a   em ma   do you understand  

understanding and gratification came together   it might be a very
indifferent piece of wit  but emma found a great deal to laugh
at and enjoy in it  and so did frank and harriet   it did not seem
to touch the rest of the party equally  some looked very stupid
about it  and mr  knightley gravely said 

 this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted  and mr  weston
has done very well for himself  but he must have knocked up every
body else    perfection  should not have come quite so soon  

 oh  for myself  i protest i must be excused   said mrs  elton 
  i  really cannot attempt  i am not at all fond of the sort of thing 
i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name  which i was not
at all pleased with   i knew who it came from   an abominable puppy   
you know who i mean  nodding to her husband   these kind of things
are very well at christmas  when one is sitting round the fire 
but quite out of place  in my opinion  when one is exploring
about the country in summer   miss woodhouse must excuse me 
i am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service 
i do not pretend to be a wit   i have a great deal of vivacity
in my own way  but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak
and when to hold my tongue   pass us  if you please  mr  churchill 
pass mr  e   knightley  jane  and myself   we have nothing clever to say  
not one of us 

 yes  yes  pray pass  me    added her husband  with a sort of
sneering consciousness    i  have nothing to say that can entertain
miss woodhouse  or any other young lady   an old married man  
quite good for nothing   shall we walk  augusta  

 with all my heart   i am really tired of exploring so long
on one spot   come  jane  take my other arm  

jane declined it  however  and the husband and wife walked off 
 happy couple   said frank churchill  as soon as they were out
of hearing    how well they suit one another   very lucky  marrying as
they did  upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place   they only
knew each other  i think  a few weeks in bath   peculiarly lucky   
for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that bath 
or any public place  can give  it is all nothing  there can be
no knowledge   it is only by seeing women in their own homes 
among their own set  just as they always are  that you can form
any just judgment   short of that  it is all guess and luck  
and will generally be ill luck  how many a man has committed himself
on a short acquaintance  and rued it all the rest of his life  

miss fairfax  who had seldom spoken before  except among her
own confederates  spoke now 

 such things do occur  undoubtedly    she was stopped by a cough 
frank churchill turned towards her to listen 

 you were speaking   said he  gravely   she recovered her voice 

 i was only going to observe  that though such unfortunate circumstances
do sometimes occur both to men and women  i cannot imagine them
to be very frequent   a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise  
but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards   i would
be understood to mean  that it can be only weak  irresolute characters 
 whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance  
who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience 
an oppression for ever  

he made no answer  merely looked  and bowed in submission  and soon
afterwards said  in a lively tone 

 well  i have so little confidence in my own judgment  that whenever
i marry  i hope some body will chuse my wife for me   will you 
 turning to emma   will you chuse a wife for me   i am sure i
should like any body fixed on by you   you provide for the family 
you know   with a smile at his father   find some body for me 
i am in no hurry   adopt her  educate her  

 and make her like myself  

 by all means  if you can  

 very well   i undertake the commission   you shall have a charming wife  

 she must be very lively  and have hazle eyes   i care for nothing else 
i shall go abroad for a couple of years  and when i return 
i shall come to you for my wife   remember  

emma was in no danger of forgetting   it was a commission to touch every
favourite feeling   would not harriet be the very creature described 
hazle eyes excepted  two years more might make her all that he wished 
he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment 
who could say   referring the education to her seemed to imply it 

 now  ma am   said jane to her aunt   shall we join mrs  elton  

 if you please  my dear   with all my heart   i am quite ready 
i was ready to have gone with her  but this will do just as well 
we shall soon overtake her   there she is  no  that s somebody else 
that s one of the ladies in the irish car party  not at all like her   
well  i declare   

they walked off  followed in half a minute by mr  knightley 
mr  weston  his son  emma  and harriet  only remained  and the young
man s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant   even emma grew
tired at last of flattery and merriment  and wished herself rather
walking quietly about with any of the others  or sitting almost alone 
and quite unattended to  in tranquil observation of the beautiful
views beneath her   the appearance of the servants looking out
for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight 
and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart 
and the solicitude of mrs  elton to have  her  carriage first 
were gladly endured  in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was
to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure 
such another scheme  composed of so many ill assorted people 
she hoped never to be betrayed into again 

while waiting for the carriage  she found mr  knightley by her side 
he looked around  as if to see that no one were near  and then said 

 emma  i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do 
a privilege rather endured than allowed  perhaps  but i must still
use it   i cannot see you acting wrong  without a remonstrance 
how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates   how could you be so
insolent in your wit to a woman of her character  age  and situation   
emma  i had not thought it possible  

emma recollected  blushed  was sorry  but tried to laugh it off 

 nay  how could i help saying what i did   nobody could have helped it 
it was not so very bad   i dare say she did not understand me  

 i assure you she did   she felt your full meaning   she has talked
of it since   i wish you could have heard how she talked of it  
with what candour and generosity   i wish you could have heard her
honouring your forbearance  in being able to pay her such attentions 
as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father 
when her society must be so irksome  

 oh   cried emma   i know there is not a better creature in the world 
but you must allow  that what is good and what is ridiculous are
most unfortunately blended in her  

 they are blended   said he   i acknowledge  and  were she prosperous 
i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous
over the good   were she a woman of fortune  i would leave every
harmless absurdity to take its chance  i would not quarrel with you
for any liberties of manner   were she your equal in situation  
but  emma  consider how far this is from being the case   she is poor 
she has sunk from the comforts she was born to  and  if she live
to old age  must probably sink more   her situation should secure
your compassion   it was badly done  indeed   you  whom she had known
from an infant  whom she had seen grow up from a period when her
notice was an honour  to have you now  in thoughtless spirits 
and the pride of the moment  laugh at her  humble her  and before
her niece  too  and before others  many of whom  certainly  some   
would be entirely guided by  your  treatment of her   this is not
pleasant to you  emma  and it is very far from pleasant to me 
but i must  i will   i will tell you truths while i can 
satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel 
and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice
than you can do now  

while they talked  they were advancing towards the carriage 
it was ready  and  before she could speak again  he had handed her in 
he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted 
and her tongue motionless   they were combined only of anger
against herself  mortification  and deep concern   she had not
been able to speak  and  on entering the carriage  sunk back
for a moment overcome  then reproaching herself for having taken
no leave  making no acknowledgment  parting in apparent sullenness 
she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference 
but it was just too late   he had turned away  and the horses were
in motion   she continued to look back  but in vain  and soon 
with what appeared unusual speed  they were half way down the hill 
and every thing left far behind   she was vexed beyond what could
have been expressed  almost beyond what she could conceal 
never had she felt so agitated  mortified  grieved  at any circumstance
in her life   she was most forcibly struck   the truth of this
representation there was no denying   she felt it at her heart 
how could she have been so brutal  so cruel to miss bates   how could
she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued 
and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude 
of concurrence  of common kindness 

time did not compose her   as she reflected more  she seemed
but to feel it more   she never had been so depressed   happily it
was not necessary to speak   there was only harriet  who seemed not
in spirits herself  fagged  and very willing to be silent  and emma
felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home 
without being at any trouble to check them  extraordinary as they were 



chapter viii


the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma s thoughts all
the evening   how it might be considered by the rest of the party 
she could not tell   they  in their different homes  and their different
ways  might be looking back on it with pleasure  but in her view it
was a morning more completely misspent  more totally bare of rational
satisfaction at the time  and more to be abhorred in recollection 
than any she had ever passed   a whole evening of back gammon with
her father  was felicity to it    there   indeed  lay real pleasure 
for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty four
to his comfort  and feeling that  unmerited as might be the degree
of his fond affection and confiding esteem  she could not  in her
general conduct  be open to any severe reproach   as a daughter 
she hoped she was not without a heart   she hoped no one could
have said to her   how could you be so unfeeling to your father   
i must  i will tell you truths while i can    miss bates should
never again  no  never   if attention  in future  could do away
the past  she might hope to be forgiven   she had been often remiss 
her conscience told her so  remiss  perhaps  more in thought
than fact  scornful  ungracious   but it should be so no more 
in the warmth of true contrition  she would call upon her the
very next morning  and it should be the beginning  on her side 
of a regular  equal  kindly intercourse 

she was just as determined when the morrow came  and went early 
that nothing might prevent her   it was not unlikely  she thought 
that she might see mr  knightley in her way  or  perhaps  he might
come in while she were paying her visit   she had no objection 
she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence  so justly
and truly hers   her eyes were towards donwell as she walked  but she
saw him not 

 the ladies were all at home    she had never rejoiced at the sound
before  nor ever before entered the passage  nor walked up the stairs 
with any wish of giving pleasure  but in conferring obligation 
or of deriving it  except in subsequent ridicule 

there was a bustle on her approach  a good deal of moving and talking 
she heard miss bates s voice  something was to be done in a hurry 
the maid looked frightened and awkward  hoped she would be pleased
to wait a moment  and then ushered her in too soon   the aunt and
niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room   jane she had
a distinct glimpse of  looking extremely ill  and  before the door
had shut them out  she heard miss bates saying   well  my dear 
i shall  say  you are laid down upon the bed  and i am sure you are
ill enough  

poor old mrs  bates  civil and humble as usual  looked as if she
did not quite understand what was going on 

 i am afraid jane is not very well   said she   but i do not know 
they  tell  me she is well   i dare say my daughter will be here presently 
miss woodhouse   i hope you find a chair   i wish hetty had not gone 
i am very little able  have you a chair  ma am  do you sit where
you like   i am sure she will be here presently  

emma seriously hoped she would   she had a moment s fear of miss
bates keeping away from her   but miss bates soon came   very happy
and obliged   but emma s conscience told her that there was not the
same cheerful volubility as before  less ease of look and manner 
a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax  she hoped  might lead
the way to a return of old feelings   the touch seemed immediate 

 ah   miss woodhouse  how kind you are   i suppose you have heard  
and are come to give us joy   this does not seem much like joy 
indeed  in me   twinkling away a tear or two   but it will be
very trying for us to part with her  after having had her so long 
and she has a dreadful headache just now  writing all the morning   
such long letters  you know  to be written to colonel campbell 
and mrs  dixon    my dear   said i   you will blind yourself   
for tears were in her eyes perpetually   one cannot wonder 
one cannot wonder   it is a great change  and though she is
amazingly fortunate  such a situation  i suppose  as no young woman
before ever met with on first going out  do not think us ungrateful 
miss woodhouse  for such surprising good fortune   again dispersing
her tears   but  poor dear soul  if you were to see what a headache
she has   when one is in great pain  you know one cannot feel
any blessing quite as it may deserve   she is as low as possible 
to look at her  nobody would think how delighted and happy she
is to have secured such a situation   you will excuse her not
coming to you  she is not able  she is gone into her own room  
i want her to lie down upon the bed    my dear   said i   i shall
say you are laid down upon the bed    but  however  she is not 
she is walking about the room   but  now that she has written
her letters  she says she shall soon be well   she will be extremely
sorry to miss seeing you  miss woodhouse  but your kindness will
excuse her   you were kept waiting at the door  i was quite ashamed  
but somehow there was a little bustle  for it so happened that we
had not heard the knock  and till you were on the stairs  we did
not know any body was coming    it is only mrs  cole   said i 
 depend upon it   nobody else would come so early     well   said she 
 it must be borne some time or other  and it may as well be now  
but then patty came in  and said it was you    oh   said i 
 it is miss woodhouse   i am sure you will like to see her    
 i can see nobody   said she  and up she got  and would go away 
and that was what made us keep you waiting  and extremely sorry
and ashamed we were    if you must go  my dear   said i   you must 
and i will say you are laid down upon the bed   

emma was most sincerely interested   her heart had been long growing
kinder towards jane  and this picture of her present sufferings acted
as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion  and left her nothing
but pity  and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle
sensations of the past  obliged her to admit that jane might very
naturally resolve on seeing mrs  cole or any other steady friend 
when she might not bear to see herself   she spoke as she felt 
with earnest regret and solicitude  sincerely wishing that the
circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually
determined on  might be as much for miss fairfax s advantage
and comfort as possible    it must be a severe trial to them all 
she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell s return  

 so very kind   replied miss bates    but you are always kind  

there was no bearing such an  always   and to break through her
dreadful gratitude  emma made the direct inquiry of  

 where  may i ask   is miss fairfax going  

 to a mrs  smallridge  charming woman  most superior  to have
the charge of her three little girls  delightful children 
impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort 
if we except  perhaps  mrs  suckling s own family  and mrs  bragge s 
but mrs  smallridge is intimate with both  and in the very
same neighbourhood   lives only four miles from maple grove 
jane will be only four miles from maple grove  

 mrs  elton  i suppose  has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes   

 yes  our good mrs  elton   the most indefatigable  true friend 
she would not take a denial   she would not let jane say   no   for
when jane first heard of it   it was the day before yesterday 
the very morning we were at donwell   when jane first heard of it 
she was quite decided against accepting the offer  and for the
reasons you mention  exactly as you say  she had made up her mind
to close with nothing till colonel campbell s return  and nothing
should induce her to enter into any engagement at present  and so she
told mrs  elton over and over again  and i am sure i had no more
idea that she would change her mind   but that good mrs  elton 
whose judgment never fails her  saw farther than i did   it is not
every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did 
and refuse to take jane s answer  but she positively declared she
would  not  write any such denial yesterday  as jane wished her 
she would wait  and  sure enough  yesterday evening it was all
settled that jane should go   quite a surprize to me   i had not
the least idea   jane took mrs  elton aside  and told her at once 
that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs  smallridge s situation 
she had come to the resolution of accepting it   i did not know a word
of it till it was all settled  

 you spent the evening with mrs  elton  

 yes  all of us  mrs  elton would have us come   it was settled so 
upon the hill  while we were walking about with mr  knightley 
 you  must   all  spend your evening with us   said she   i positively must
have you  all  come   

 mr  knightley was there too  was he  

 no  not mr  knightley  he declined it from the first  and though i
thought he would come  because mrs  elton declared she would not let
him off  he did not   but my mother  and jane  and i  were all there 
and a very agreeable evening we had   such kind friends  you know 
miss woodhouse  one must always find agreeable  though every body
seemed rather fagged after the morning s party   even pleasure 
you know  is fatiguing  and i cannot say that any of them seemed
very much to have enjoyed it   however   i  shall always think it
a very pleasant party  and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends
who included me in it  

 miss fairfax  i suppose  though you were not aware of it  had been
making up her mind the whole day  

 i dare say she had  

 whenever the time may come  it must be unwelcome to her and all
her friends  but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation
that is possible  i mean  as to the character and manners of the family  

 thank you  dear miss woodhouse   yes  indeed  there is every thing
in the world that can make her happy in it   except the sucklings
and bragges  there is not such another nursery establishment 
so liberal and elegant  in all mrs  elton s acquaintance 
mrs  smallridge  a most delightful woman   a style of living almost
equal to maple grove  and as to the children  except the little
sucklings and little bragges  there are not such elegant sweet
children anywhere   jane will be treated with such regard and kindness   
it will be nothing but pleasure  a life of pleasure   and her salary   
i really cannot venture to name her salary to you  miss woodhouse 
even you  used as you are to great sums  would hardly believe that
so much could be given to a young person like jane  

 ah  madam   cried emma   if other children are at all like what i
remember to have been myself  i should think five times the amount
of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions 
dearly earned  

 you are so noble in your ideas  

 and when is miss fairfax to leave you  

 very soon  very soon  indeed  that s the worst of it 
within a fortnight   mrs  smallridge is in a great hurry   my poor
mother does not know how to bear it   so then  i try to put it out of
her thoughts  and say  come ma am  do not let us think about it any more  

 her friends must all be sorry to lose her  and will not colonel
and mrs  campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself
before their return  

 yes  jane says she is sure they will  but yet  this is such
a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining 
i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying
to mrs  elton  and when mrs  elton at the same moment came congratulating
me upon it   it was before tea  stay  no  it could not be before tea 
because we were just going to cards  and yet it was before tea 
because i remember thinking  oh  no  now i recollect  now i have it 
something happened before tea  but not that   mr  elton was called
out of the room before tea  old john abdy s son wanted to speak
with him   poor old john  i have a great regard for him  he was clerk
to my poor father twenty seven years  and now  poor old man  he is
bed ridden  and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints  
i must go and see him to day  and so will jane  i am sure  if she
gets out at all   and poor john s son came to talk to mr  elton
about relief from the parish  he is very well to do himself 
you know  being head man at the crown  ostler  and every thing
of that sort  but still he cannot keep his father without some help 
and so  when mr  elton came back  he told us what john ostler
had been telling him  and then it came out about the chaise having
been sent to randalls to take mr  frank churchill to richmond 
that was what happened before tea   it was after tea that jane spoke
to mrs  elton  

miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly
new this circumstance was to her  but as without supposing it
possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars
of mr  frank churchill s going  she proceeded to give them all 
it was of no consequence 

what mr  elton had learned from the ostler on the subject  being the
accumulation of the ostler s own knowledge  and the knowledge
of the servants at randalls  was  that a messenger had come over
from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill  
which messenger  however  had been no more than was expected 
and that mr  churchill had sent his nephew a few lines  containing 
upon the whole  a tolerable account of mrs  churchill  and only
wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early 
but that mr  frank churchill having resolved to go home directly 
without waiting at all  and his horse seeming to have got a cold 
tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise  and the
ostler had stood out and seen it pass by  the boy going a good pace 
and driving very steady 

there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest 
and it caught emma s attention only as it united with the subject
which already engaged her mind   the contrast between mrs  churchill s
importance in the world  and jane fairfax s  struck her  one was
every thing  the other nothing  and she sat musing on the difference
of woman s destiny  and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed 
till roused by miss bates s saying 

 aye  i see what you are thinking of  the pianoforte   what is to become
of that   very true   poor dear jane was talking of it just now   
 you must go   said she    you and i must part   you will have no
business here   let it stay  however   said she   give it houseroom
till colonel campbell comes back   i shall talk about it to him 
he will settle for me  he will help me out of all my difficulties    
and to this day  i do believe  she knows not whether it was his
present or his daughter s  

now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte  and the remembrance
of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing 
that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been
long enough  and  with a repetition of every thing that she could
venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt  took leave 



chapter ix


emma s pensive meditations  as she walked home  were not interrupted 
but on entering the parlour  she found those who must rouse her 
mr  knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence  and were
sitting with her father   mr  knightley immediately got up  and in a
manner decidedly graver than usual  said 

 i would not go away without seeing you  but i have no time to spare 
and therefore must now be gone directly   i am going to london 
to spend a few days with john and isabella   have you any thing to
send or say  besides the  love   which nobody carries  

 nothing at all   but is not this a sudden scheme  

 yes  rather  i have been thinking of it some little time  

emma was sure he had not forgiven her  he looked unlike himself 
time  however  she thought  would tell him that they ought to be
friends again   while he stood  as if meaning to go  but not going  
her father began his inquiries 

 well  my dear  and did you get there safely   and how did you
find my worthy old friend and her daughter   i dare say they must
have been very much obliged to you for coming   dear emma has been
to call on mrs  and miss bates  mr  knightley  as i told you before 
she is always so attentive to them  

emma s colour was heightened by this unjust praise  and with a smile 
and shake of the head  which spoke much  she looked at mr  knightley   
it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour 
as if his eyes received the truth from her s  and all that had
passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured   
he looked at her with a glow of regard   she was warmly gratified  
and in another moment still more so  by a little movement of
more than common friendliness on his part   he took her hand   
whether she had not herself made the first motion  she could not say  
she might  perhaps  have rather offered it  but he took her hand 
pressed it  and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips  
when  from some fancy or other  he suddenly let it go   why he should feel
such a scruple  why he should change his mind when it was all but done 
she could not perceive   he would have judged better  she thought 
if he had not stopped   the intention  however  was indubitable 
and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry 
or however else it happened  but she thought nothing became him more   
it was with him  of so simple  yet so dignified a nature   
she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction 
it spoke such perfect amity   he left them immediately afterwards  
gone in a moment   he always moved with the alertness of a mind which
could neither be undecided nor dilatory  but now he seemed more sudden
than usual in his disappearance 

emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates  but she wished
she had left her ten minutes earlier   it would have been a great
pleasure to talk over jane fairfax s situation with mr  knightley   
neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square 
for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed  but it might have
happened at a better time  and to have had longer notice of it 
would have been pleasanter   they parted thorough friends  however 
she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance 
and his unfinished gallantry   it was all done to assure her that she
had fully recovered his good opinion   he had been sitting with them
half an hour  she found   it was a pity that she had not come
back earlier 

in the hope of diverting her father s thoughts from the disagreeableness
of mr  knightley s going to london  and going so suddenly 
and going on horseback  which she knew would be all very bad 
emma communicated her news of jane fairfax  and her dependence
on the effect was justified  it supplied a very useful check   
interested  without disturbing him   he had long made up his mind to jane
fairfax s going out as governess  and could talk of it cheerfully 
but mr  knightley s going to london had been an unexpected blow 

 i am very glad  indeed  my dear  to hear she is to be so
comfortably settled   mrs  elton is very good natured and agreeable 
and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought
to be   i hope it is a dry situation  and that her health
will be taken good care of   it ought to be a first object 
as i am sure poor miss taylor s always was with me   you know 
my dear  she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor
was to us   and i hope she will be better off in one respect 
and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long  

the following day brought news from richmond to throw every
thing else into the background   an express arrived at randalls
to announce the death of mrs  churchill   though her nephew
had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account 
she had not lived above six and thirty hours after his return 
a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded
by her general state  had carried her off after a short struggle 
the great mrs  churchill was no more 

it was felt as such things must be felt   every body had a
degree of gravity and sorrow  tenderness towards the departed 
solicitude for the surviving friends  and  in a reasonable time 
curiosity to know where she would be buried   goldsmith tells us 
that when lovely woman stoops to folly  she has nothing to do
but to die  and when she stoops to be disagreeable  it is equally
to be recommended as a clearer of ill fame  mrs  churchill 
after being disliked at least twenty five years  was now spoken of
with compassionate allowances   in one point she was fully justified 
she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill   the event
acquitted her of all the fancifulness  and all the selfishness
of imaginary complaints 

 poor mrs  churchill  no doubt she had been suffering a great deal 
more than any body had ever supposed  and continual pain would try
the temper   it was a sad event  a great shock  with all her faults 
what would mr  churchill do without her   mr  churchill s loss
would be dreadful indeed   mr  churchill would never get over it    
even mr  weston shook his head  and looked solemn  and said 
 ah  poor woman  who would have thought it   and resolved  that his
mourning should be as handsome as possible  and his wife sat sighing
and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense 
true and steady   how it would affect frank was among the earliest
thoughts of both   it was also a very early speculation with emma 
the character of mrs  churchill  the grief of her husband  her mind
glanced over them both with awe and compassion  and then rested
with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event 
how benefited  how freed   she saw in a moment all the possible good 
now  an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter 
mr  churchill  independent of his wife  was feared by nobody 
an easy  guidable man  to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew 
all that remained to be wished was  that the nephew should form
the attachment  as  with all her goodwill in the cause  emma could feel
no certainty of its being already formed 

harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion  with great self command 
what ever she might feel of brighter hope  she betrayed nothing   emma was
gratified  to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character 
and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance 
they spoke  therefore  of mrs  churchill s death with mutual forbearance 

short letters from frank were received at randalls  communicating
all that was immediately important of their state and plans 
mr  churchill was better than could be expected  and their
first removal  on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire 
was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor  to whom
mr  churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years 
at present  there was nothing to be done for harriet  good wishes
for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma s side 

it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax 
whose prospects were closing  while harriet s opened  and whose
engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury  who wished
to shew her kindness  and with emma it was grown into a first wish 
she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness 
and the person  whom she had been so many months neglecting  was now
the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of
regard or sympathy   she wanted to be of use to her  wanted to shew
a value for her society  and testify respect and consideration 
she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield 
a note was written to urge it   the invitation was refused  and by
a verbal message    miss fairfax was not well enough to write  
and when mr  perry called at hartfield  the same morning 
it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited 
though against her own consent  by himself  and that she was suffering
under severe headaches  and a nervous fever to a degree  which made
him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs  smallridge s at the
time proposed   her health seemed for the moment completely deranged  
appetite quite gone  and though there were no absolutely
alarming symptoms  nothing touching the pulmonary complaint 
which was the standing apprehension of the family  mr  perry was
uneasy about her   he thought she had undertaken more than she
was equal to  and that she felt it so herself  though she would
not own it   her spirits seemed overcome   her present home 
he could not but observe  was unfavourable to a nervous disorder   
confined always to one room   he could have wished it otherwise  
and her good aunt  though his very old friend  he must acknowledge
to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description 
her care and attention could not be questioned  they were  in fact 
only too great   he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more
evil than good from them   emma listened with the warmest concern 
grieved for her more and more  and looked around eager to discover
some way of being useful   to take her  be it only an hour
or two  from her aunt  to give her change of air and scene 
and quiet rational conversation  even for an hour or two 
might do her good  and the following morning she wrote again to say 
in the most feeling language she could command  that she would
call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name  
mentioning that she had mr  perry s decided opinion  in favour
of such exercise for his patient   the answer was only in this
short note 

 miss fairfax s compliments and thanks  but is quite unequal
to any exercise  

emma felt that her own note had deserved something better  but it
was impossible to quarrel with words  whose tremulous inequality
shewed indisposition so plainly  and she thought only of how she
might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted 
in spite of the answer  therefore  she ordered the carriage  and drove
to mrs  bates s  in the hope that jane would be induced to join her  
but it would not do   miss bates came to the carriage door  all gratitude 
and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of
the greatest service  and every thing that message could do was tried  
but all in vain   miss bates was obliged to return without success 
jane was quite unpersuadable  the mere proposal of going out
seemed to make her worse   emma wished she could have seen her 
and tried her own powers  but  almost before she could hint the wish 
miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on
no account to let miss woodhouse in    indeed  the truth was 
that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body  any body at all  
mrs  elton  indeed  could not be denied  and mrs  cole had made
such a point  and mrs  perry had said so much  but  except them 
jane would really see nobody  

emma did not want to be classed with the mrs  eltons  the mrs  perrys 
and the mrs  coles  who would force themselves anywhere 
neither could she feel any right of preference herself  
she submitted  therefore  and only questioned miss bates farther
as to her niece s appetite and diet  which she longed to be able
to assist   on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy 
and very communicative  jane would hardly eat any thing   
mr  perry recommended nourishing food  but every thing they could
command  and never had any body such good neighbours  was distasteful 

emma  on reaching home  called the housekeeper directly  to an
examination of her stores  and some arrowroot of very superior quality
was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note 
in half an hour the arrowroot was returned  with a thousand thanks
from miss bates  but  dear jane would not be satisfied without its
being sent back  it was a thing she could not take  and  moreover 
she insisted on her saying  that she was not at all in want of any thing  

when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering
about the meadows  at some distance from highbury  on the afternoon
of the very day on which she had  under the plea of being unequal
to any exercise  so peremptorily refused to go out with her in
the carriage  she could have no doubt  putting every thing together  
that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from  her    she was sorry 
very sorry   her heart was grieved for a state which seemed
but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits 
inconsistency of action  and inequality of powers  and it mortified
her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling  or esteemed
so little worthy as a friend   but she had the consolation of knowing
that her intentions were good  and of being able to say to herself 
that could mr  knightley have been privy to all her attempts
of assisting jane fairfax  could he even have seen into her heart 
he would not  on this occasion  have found any thing to reprove 



chapter x


one morning  about ten days after mrs  churchill s decease 
emma was called downstairs to mr  weston  who  could not stay
five minutes  and wanted particularly to speak with her    
he met her at the parlour door  and hardly asking her how she did 
in the natural key of his voice  sunk it immediately  to say 
unheard by her father 

 can you come to randalls at any time this morning   do  if it
be possible   mrs  weston wants to see you   she must see you  

 is she unwell  

 no  no  not at all  only a little agitated   she would have
ordered the carriage  and come to you  but she must see you  alone  
and that you know   nodding towards her father   humph   can you come  

 certainly   this moment  if you please   it is impossible to
refuse what you ask in such a way   but what can be the matter   
is she really not ill  

 depend upon me  but ask no more questions   you will know it
all in time   the most unaccountable business   but hush  hush  

to guess what all this meant  was impossible even for emma 
something really important seemed announced by his looks 
but  as her friend was well  she endeavoured not to be uneasy 
and settling it with her father  that she would take her walk now 
she and mr  weston were soon out of the house together and on
their way at a quick pace for randalls 

 now    said emma  when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates   
 now mr  weston  do let me know what has happened  

 no  no    he gravely replied    don t ask me   i promised my wife
to leave it all to her   she will break it to you better than i can 
do not be impatient  emma  it will all come out too soon  

 break it to me   cried emma  standing still with terror   
 good god   mr  weston  tell me at once   something has happened
in brunswick square   i know it has   tell me  i charge you tell
me this moment what it is  

 no  indeed you are mistaken    

 mr  weston do not trifle with me   consider how many of my dearest
friends are now in brunswick square   which of them is it   
i charge you by all that is sacred  not to attempt concealment  

 upon my word  emma    

 your word   why not your honour   why not say upon your honour 
that it has nothing to do with any of them   good heavens   what can
be to be  broke  to me  that does not relate to one of that family  

 upon my honour   said he very seriously   it does not   it is not
in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name
of knightley  

emma s courage returned  and she walked on 

 i was wrong   he continued   in talking of its being  broke  to you 
i should not have used the expression   in fact  it does not concern you  
it concerns only myself   that is  we hope   humph   in short 
my dear emma  there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it 
i don t say that it is not a disagreeable business  but things might
be much worse   if we walk fast  we shall soon be at randalls  

emma found that she must wait  and now it required little effort 
she asked no more questions therefore  merely employed her own fancy 
and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some
money concern  something just come to light  of a disagreeable
nature in the circumstances of the family   something which the late
event at richmond had brought forward   her fancy was very active 
half a dozen natural children  perhaps  and poor frank cut off   
this  though very undesirable  would be no matter of agony to her 
it inspired little more than an animating curiosity 

 who is that gentleman on horseback   said she  as they proceeded  
speaking more to assist mr  weston in keeping his secret  than with
any other view 

 i do not know   one of the otways   not frank   it is not frank 
i assure you   you will not see him   he is half way to windsor
by this time  

 has your son been with you  then  

 oh  yes  did not you know   well  well  never mind  

for a moment he was silent  and then added  in a tone much more
guarded and demure 

 yes  frank came over this morning  just to ask us how we did  

they hurried on  and were speedily at randalls    well  my dear  
said he  as they entered the room   i have brought her  and now
i hope you will soon be better   i shall leave you together 
there is no use in delay   i shall not be far off  if you want me    
and emma distinctly heard him add  in a lower tone  before he
quitted the room    i have been as good as my word   she has not the
least idea  

mrs  weston was looking so ill  and had an air of so much perturbation 
that emma s uneasiness increased  and the moment they were alone 
she eagerly said 

 what is it my dear friend   something of a very unpleasant nature 
i find  has occurred   do let me know directly what it is 
i have been walking all this way in complete suspense   we both
abhor suspense   do not let mine continue longer   it will do you
good to speak of your distress  whatever it may be  

 have you indeed no idea   said mrs  weston in a trembling voice 
 cannot you  my dear emma  cannot you form a guess as to what you
are to hear  

 so far as that it relates to mr  frank churchill  i do guess  

 you are right   it does relate to him  and i will tell you directly  
 resuming her work  and seeming resolved against looking up  
 he has been here this very morning  on a most extraordinary errand 
it is impossible to express our surprize   he came to speak to his
father on a subject   to announce an attachment   

she stopped to breathe   emma thought first of herself  and then
of harriet 

 more than an attachment  indeed   resumed mrs  weston   an engagement  
a positive engagement   what will you say  emma  what will any
body say  when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax
are engaged   nay  that they have been long engaged  

emma even jumped with surprize   and  horror struck  exclaimed 

 jane fairfax   good god   you are not serious   you do not mean it  

 you may well be amazed   returned mrs  weston  still averting her eyes 
and talking on with eagerness  that emma might have time to recover  
 you may well be amazed   but it is even so   there has been a solemn
engagement between them ever since october  formed at weymouth 
and kept a secret from every body   not a creature knowing it
but themselves  neither the campbells  nor her family  nor his   
it is so wonderful  that though perfectly convinced of the fact 
it is yet almost incredible to myself   i can hardly believe it   
i thought i knew him  

emma scarcely heard what was said   her mind was divided between
two ideas  her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax 
and poor harriet   and for some time she could only exclaim 
and require confirmation  repeated confirmation 

 well   said she at last  trying to recover herself   this is a
circumstance which i must think of at least half a day  before i
can at all comprehend it   what   engaged to her all the winter  
before either of them came to highbury  

 engaged since october   secretly engaged   it has hurt me 
emma  very much   it has hurt his father equally    some   part 
of his conduct we cannot excuse  

emma pondered a moment  and then replied   i will not pretend
 not  to understand you  and to give you all the relief in my power 
be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me 
as you are apprehensive of  

mrs  weston looked up  afraid to believe  but emma s countenance
was as steady as her words 

 that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast  of my
present perfect indifference   she continued   i will farther tell you 
that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance 
when i did like him  when i was very much disposed to be
attached to him  nay  was attached  and how it came to cease 
is perhaps the wonder   fortunately  however  it did cease 
i have really for some time past  for at least these three months 
cared nothing about him   you may believe me  mrs  weston 
this is the simple truth  

mrs  weston kissed her with tears of joy  and when she could
find utterance  assured her  that this protestation had done
her more good than any thing else in the world could do 

 mr  weston will be almost as much relieved as myself   said she 
 on this point we have been wretched   it was our darling wish that you
might be attached to each other  and we were persuaded that it was so   
imagine what we have been feeling on your account  

 i have escaped  and that i should escape  may be a matter of
grateful wonder to you and myself   but this does not acquit  him  
mrs  weston  and i must say  that i think him greatly to blame 
what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged 
and with manners so  very  disengaged   what right had he to endeavour
to please  as he certainly did  to distinguish any one young woman with
persevering attention  as he certainly did  while he really belonged
to another   how could he tell what mischief he might be doing   
how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him   
very wrong  very wrong indeed  

 from something that he said  my dear emma  i rather imagine   

 and how could  she  bear such behaviour   composure with a witness 
to look on  while repeated attentions were offering to another woman 
before her face  and not resent it   that is a degree of placidity 
which i can neither comprehend nor respect  

 there were misunderstandings between them  emma  he said
so expressly   he had not time to enter into much explanation 
he was here only a quarter of an hour  and in a state of agitation
which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay  
but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said 
the present crisis  indeed  seemed to be brought on by them 
and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the
impropriety of his conduct  

 impropriety   oh   mrs  weston  it is too calm a censure 
much  much beyond impropriety   it has sunk him  i cannot say how
it has sunk him in my opinion   so unlike what a man should be   
none of that upright integrity  that strict adherence to truth
and principle  that disdain of trick and littleness  which a man
should display in every transaction of his life  

 nay  dear emma  now i must take his part  for though he has been
wrong in this instance  i have known him long enough to answer
for his having many  very many  good qualities  and   

 good god   cried emma  not attending to her    mrs  smallridge  too 
jane actually on the point of going as governess   what could he
mean by such horrible indelicacy   to suffer her to engage herself  
to suffer her even to think of such a measure  

 he knew nothing about it  emma   on this article i can fully
acquit him   it was a private resolution of hers  not communicated
to him  or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction   
till yesterday  i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans 
they burst on him  i do not know how  but by some letter or message  
and it was the discovery of what she was doing  of this very project
of hers  which determined him to come forward at once  own it
all to his uncle  throw himself on his kindness  and  in short 
put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been
carrying on so long  

emma began to listen better 

 i am to hear from him soon   continued mrs  weston    he told me
at parting  that he should soon write  and he spoke in a manner which
seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now 
let us wait  therefore  for this letter   it may bring many extenuations 
it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are
not to be understood   don t let us be severe  don t let us be in
a hurry to condemn him   let us have patience   i must love him 
and now that i am satisfied on one point  the one material point 
i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well  and ready
to hope that it may   they must both have suffered a great deal
under such a system of secresy and concealment  

  his  sufferings   replied emma dryly   do not appear to have done
him much harm   well  and how did mr  churchill take it  

 most favourably for his nephew  gave his consent with scarcely
a difficulty   conceive what the events of a week have done
in that family   while poor mrs  churchill lived  i suppose there
could not have been a hope  a chance  a possibility   but scarcely
are her remains at rest in the family vault  than her husband is
persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required 
what a blessing it is  when undue influence does not survive the grave   
he gave his consent with very little persuasion  

 ah   thought emma   he would have done as much for harriet  

 this was settled last night  and frank was off with the light
this morning   he stopped at highbury  at the bates s  i fancy 
some time  and then came on hither  but was in such a hurry to get
back to his uncle  to whom he is just now more necessary than ever 
that  as i tell you  he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour   
he was very much agitated  very much  indeed  to a degree that made
him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen
him before   in addition to all the rest  there had been the shock of
finding her so very unwell  which he had had no previous suspicion of  
and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal  

 and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on
with such perfect secresy   the campbells  the dixons  did none
of them know of the engagement  

emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush 

 none  not one   he positively said that it had been known to no
being in the world but their two selves  

 well   said emma   i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled
to the idea  and i wish them very happy   but i shall always
think it a very abominable sort of proceeding   what has it been
but a system of hypocrisy and deceit   espionage  and treachery   
to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity 
and such a league in secret to judge us all   here have we been 
the whole winter and spring  completely duped  fancying ourselves
all on an equal footing of truth and honour  with two people in the
midst of us who may have been carrying round  comparing and sitting
in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both
to hear   they must take the consequence  if they have heard each
other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable  

 i am quite easy on that head   replied mrs  weston    i am
very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other 
which both might not have heard  

 you are in luck   your only blunder was confined to my ear 
when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady  

 true   but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss
fairfax  i never could  under any blunder  have spoken ill of her 
and as to speaking ill of him  there i must have been safe  

at this moment mr  weston appeared at a little distance from the window 
evidently on the watch   his wife gave him a look which invited
him in  and  while he was coming round  added   now  dearest emma 
let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his
heart at ease  and incline him to be satisfied with the match 
let us make the best of it  and  indeed  almost every thing may
be fairly said in her favour   it is not a connexion to gratify 
but if mr  churchill does not feel that  why should we  and it
may be a very fortunate circumstance for him  for frank  i mean 
that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness
of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for  
and still am disposed to give her credit for  in spite of this
one great deviation from the strict rule of right   and how much
may be said in her situation for even that error  

 much  indeed   cried emma feelingly    if a woman can ever
be excused for thinking only of herself  it is in a situation
like jane fairfax s   of such  one may almost say  that  the
world is not their s  nor the world s law   

she met mr  weston on his entrance  with a smiling countenance 
exclaiming 

 a very pretty trick you have been playing me  upon my word 
this was a device  i suppose  to sport with my curiosity 
and exercise my talent of guessing   but you really frightened me 
i thought you had lost half your property  at least   and here 
instead of its being a matter of condolence  it turns out to be one
of congratulation   i congratulate you  mr  weston  with all my heart 
on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished
young women in england for your daughter  

a glance or two between him and his wife  convinced him that all was
as right as this speech proclaimed  and its happy effect on his spirits
was immediate   his air and voice recovered their usual briskness 
he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand  and entered
on the subject in a manner to prove  that he now only wanted
time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing 
his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence 
or smooth objections  and by the time they had talked it all
over together  and he had talked it all over again with emma 
in their walk back to hartfield  he was become perfectly reconciled 
and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could
possibly have done 



chapter xi


 harriet  poor harriet    those were the words  in them lay the
tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of  and which constituted
the real misery of the business to her   frank churchill had behaved
very ill by herself  very ill in many ways   but it was not so much
 his  behaviour as her  own   which made her so angry with him 
it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet s account 
that gave the deepest hue to his offence   poor harriet  to be a second
time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery   mr  knightley
had spoken prophetically  when he once said   emma  you have been
no friend to harriet smith    she was afraid she had done her nothing
but disservice   it was true that she had not to charge herself 
in this instance as in the former  with being the sole and original
author of the mischief  with having suggested such feelings as might
otherwise never have entered harriet s imagination  for harriet
had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill
before she had ever given her a hint on the subject  but she felt
completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed 
she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments 
her influence would have been enough   and now she was very conscious
that she ought to have prevented them   she felt that she had been
risking her friend s happiness on most insufficient grounds 
common sense would have directed her to tell harriet  that she
must not allow herself to think of him  and that there were five
hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her    but  with
common sense   she added   i am afraid i have had little to do  

she was extremely angry with herself   if she could not have been
angry with frank churchill too  it would have been dreadful   
as for jane fairfax  she might at least relieve her feelings
from any present solicitude on her account   harriet would
be anxiety enough  she need no longer be unhappy about jane 
whose troubles and whose ill health having  of course  the same origin 
must be equally under cure   her days of insignificance and evil
were over   she would soon be well  and happy  and prosperous   
emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted 
this discovery laid many smaller matters open   no doubt it had been
from jealousy   in jane s eyes she had been a rival  and well might
any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed 
an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack 
and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison 
she understood it all  and as far as her mind could disengage itself
from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings  she acknowledged
that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond
her desert   but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge 
there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else 
emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be
more severe than the first   considering the very superior claims
of the object  it ought  and judging by its apparently stronger effect
on harriet s mind  producing reserve and self command  it would   
she must communicate the painful truth  however  and as soon
as possible   an injunction of secresy had been among mr  weston s
parting words    for the present  the whole affair was to be
completely a secret   mr  churchill had made a point of it 
as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost 
and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum    
emma had promised  but still harriet must be excepted   it was her
superior duty 

in spite of her vexation  she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous 
that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to
perform by harriet  which mrs  weston had just gone through by herself 
the intelligence  which had been so anxiously announced to her 
she was now to be anxiously announcing to another   her heart beat
quick on hearing harriet s footstep and voice  so  she supposed 
had poor mrs  weston felt when  she  was approaching randalls 
could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance   
but of that  unfortunately  there could be no chance 

 well  miss woodhouse   cried harriet  coming eagerly into the room  
 is not this the oddest news that ever was  

 what news do you mean   replied emma  unable to guess  by look
or voice  whether harriet could indeed have received any hint 

 about jane fairfax   did you ever hear any thing so strange 
oh   you need not be afraid of owning it to me  for mr  weston has
told me himself   i met him just now   he told me it was to be
a great secret  and  therefore  i should not think of mentioning
it to any body but you  but he said you knew it  

 what did mr  weston tell you    said emma  still perplexed 

 oh  he told me all about it  that jane fairfax and mr  frank
churchill are to be married  and that they have been privately
engaged to one another this long while   how very odd  

it was  indeed  so odd  harriet s behaviour was so extremely odd 
that emma did not know how to understand it   her character appeared
absolutely changed   she seemed to propose shewing no agitation 
or disappointment  or peculiar concern in the discovery   emma looked
at her  quite unable to speak 

 had you any idea   cried harriet   of his being in love
with her   you  perhaps  might   you  blushing as she spoke 
who can see into every body s heart  but nobody else   

 upon my word   said emma   i begin to doubt my having any such talent 
can you seriously ask me  harriet  whether i imagined him attached
to another woman at the very time that i was  tacitly  if not openly  
encouraging you to give way to your own feelings   i never had
the slightest suspicion  till within the last hour  of mr  frank
churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax   you may be
very sure that if i had  i should have cautioned you accordingly  

 me   cried harriet  colouring  and astonished    why should you
caution me   you do not think i care about mr  frank churchill  

 i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject  
replied emma  smiling   but you do not mean to deny that there
was a time  and not very distant either  when you gave me reason
to understand that you did care about him  

 him   never  never   dear miss woodhouse  how could you so mistake me  
turning away distressed 

 harriet   cried emma  after a moment s pause   what do you mean   
good heaven  what do you mean   mistake you   am i to suppose then    

she could not speak another word   her voice was lost  and she
sat down  waiting in great terror till harriet should answer 

harriet  who was standing at some distance  and with face turned
from her  did not immediately say any thing  and when she did speak 
it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma s 

 i should not have thought it possible   she began   that you
could have misunderstood me   i know we agreed never to name him  
but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else 
i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed
to mean any other person   mr  frank churchill  indeed   i do not
know who would ever look at him in the company of the other 
i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr  frank churchill 
who is like nobody by his side   and that you should have been
so mistaken  is amazing   i am sure  but for believing that you
entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment 
i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost 
to dare to think of him   at first  if you had not told me
that more wonderful things had happened  that there had been
matches of greater disparity  those were your very words    
i should not have dared to give way to  i should not have thought
it possible  but if  you   who had been always acquainted with him   

 harriet   cried emma  collecting herself resolutely   let us
understand each other now  without the possibility of farther mistake 
are you speaking of  mr  knightley  

 to be sure i am   i never could have an idea of any body else  
and so i thought you knew   when we talked about him  it was as clear
as possible  

 not quite   returned emma  with forced calmness   for all that
you then said  appeared to me to relate to a different person 
i could almost assert that you had  named  mr  frank churchill 
i am sure the service mr  frank churchill had rendered you 
in protecting you from the gipsies  was spoken of  

 oh   miss woodhouse  how you do forget  

 my dear harriet  i perfectly remember the substance of what i
said on the occasion   i told you that i did not wonder at
your attachment  that considering the service he had rendered you 
it was extremely natural   and you agreed to it  expressing yourself
very warmly as to your sense of that service  and mentioning
even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward
to your rescue   the impression of it is strong on my memory  

 oh  dear   cried harriet   now i recollect what you mean  but i
was thinking of something very different at the time   it was not
the gipsies  it was not mr  frank churchill that i meant   no   with
some elevation  i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance  
of mr  knightley s coming and asking me to dance  when mr  elton
would not stand up with me  and when there was no other partner in
the room   that was the kind action  that was the noble benevolence
and generosity  that was the service which made me begin to feel
how superior he was to every other being upon earth  

 good god   cried emma   this has been a most unfortunate  
most deplorable mistake   what is to be done  

 you would not have encouraged me  then  if you had understood me 
at least  however  i cannot be worse off than i should have been 
if the other had been the person  and now  it  is  possible   

she paused a few moments   emma could not speak 

 i do not wonder  miss woodhouse   she resumed   that you should feel
a great difference between the two  as to me or as to any body 
you must think one five hundred million times more above me than
the other   but i hope  miss woodhouse  that supposing  that if  
strange as it may appear     but you know they were your own words 
that  more  wonderful things had happened  matches of  greater  disparity
had taken place than between mr  frank churchill and me  and  therefore 
it seems as if such a thing even as this  may have occurred before  
and if i should be so fortunate  beyond expression  as to  
if mr  knightley should really  if  he  does not mind the disparity 
i hope  dear miss woodhouse  you will not set yourself against it 
and try to put difficulties in the way   but you are too good for that 
i am sure  

harriet was standing at one of the windows   emma turned round
to look at her in consternation  and hastily said 

 have you any idea of mr  knightley s returning your affection  

 yes   replied harriet modestly  but not fearfully   i must say
that i have  

emma s eyes were instantly withdrawn  and she sat silently meditating 
in a fixed attitude  for a few minutes   a few minutes were sufficient
for making her acquainted with her own heart   a mind like hers 
once opening to suspicion  made rapid progress   she touched  
she admitted  she acknowledged the whole truth   why was it
so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr  knightley 
than with frank churchill   why was the evil so dreadfully increased
by harriet s having some hope of a return   it darted through her 
with the speed of an arrow  that mr  knightley must marry no one
but herself 

her own conduct  as well as her own heart  was before her in the
same few minutes   she saw it all with a clearness which had
never blessed her before   how improperly had she been acting
by harriet   how inconsiderate  how indelicate  how irrational 
how unfeeling had been her conduct   what blindness  what madness 
had led her on   it struck her with dreadful force  and she
was ready to give it every bad name in the world   some portion
of respect for herself  however  in spite of all these demerits  
some concern for her own appearance  and a strong sense of justice
by harriet   there would be no need of  compassion  to the girl
who believed herself loved by mr  knightley  but justice required
that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now  
gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness 
with even apparent kindness   for her own advantage indeed  it was fit
that the utmost extent of harriet s hopes should be enquired into 
and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest
which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained  or to deserve
to be slighted by the person  whose counsels had never led her right   
rousing from reflection  therefore  and subduing her emotion 
she turned to harriet again  and  in a more inviting accent  renewed
the conversation  for as to the subject which had first introduced it 
the wonderful story of jane fairfax  that was quite sunk and lost   
neither of them thought but of mr  knightley and themselves 

harriet  who had been standing in no unhappy reverie  was yet very glad
to be called from it  by the now encouraging manner of such a judge 
and such a friend as miss woodhouse  and only wanted invitation 
to give the history of her hopes with great  though trembling
delight   emma s tremblings as she asked  and as she listened 
were better concealed than harriet s  but they were not less 
her voice was not unsteady  but her mind was in all the perturbation
that such a development of self  such a burst of threatening evil 
such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions  must create   
she listened with much inward suffering  but with great outward
patience  to harriet s detail   methodical  or well arranged 
or very well delivered  it could not be expected to be 
but it contained  when separated from all the feebleness and
tautology of the narration  a substance to sink her spirit  
especially with the corroborating circumstances  which her own memory
brought in favour of mr  knightley s most improved opinion of harriet 

harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since
those two decisive dances   emma knew that he had  on that occasion 
found her much superior to his expectation   from that evening 
or at least from the time of miss woodhouse s encouraging her
to think of him  harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking
to her much more than he had been used to do  and of his having
indeed quite a different manner towards her  a manner of kindness
and sweetness   latterly she had been more and more aware of it 
when they had been all walking together  he had so often come and walked
by her  and talked so very delightfully   he seemed to want to be
acquainted with her   emma knew it to have been very much the case 
she had often observed the change  to almost the same extent   
harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him  
and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had
known of his opinion of harriet   he praised her for being without
art or affectation  for having simple  honest  generous  feelings   
she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet  he had dwelt
on them to her more than once   much that lived in harriet s memory 
many little particulars of the notice she had received from him  a look 
a speech  a removal from one chair to another  a compliment implied 
a preference inferred  had been unnoticed  because unsuspected 
by emma   circumstances that might swell to half an hour s relation 
and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them  had passed
undiscerned by her who now heard them  but the two latest occurrences
to be mentioned  the two of strongest promise to harriet  were not
without some degree of witness from emma herself   the first 
was his walking with her apart from the others  in the lime walk
at donwell  where they had been walking some time before emma came 
and he had taken pains  as she was convinced  to draw her from
the rest to himself  and at first  he had talked to her in a more
particular way than he had ever done before  in a very particular
way indeed    harriet could not recall it without a blush   he seemed
to be almost asking her  whether her affections were engaged   
but as soon as she  miss woodhouse  appeared likely to join them 
he changed the subject  and began talking about farming   
the second  was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour
before emma came back from her visit  the very last morning of his
being at hartfield  though  when he first came in  he had said
that he could not stay five minutes  and his having told her 
during their conversation  that though he must go to london 
it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all 
which was much more  as emma felt  than he had acknowledged to  her  
the superior degree of confidence towards harriet  which this one
article marked  gave her severe pain 

on the subject of the first of the two circumstances  she did 
after a little reflection  venture the following question 
 might he not   is not it possible  that when enquiring  as you thought 
into the state of your affections  he might be alluding to mr  martin  
he might have mr  martin s interest in view   but harriet rejected
the suspicion with spirit 

 mr  martin   no indeed   there was not a hint of mr  martin 
i hope i know better now  than to care for mr  martin  or to be
suspected of it  

when harriet had closed her evidence  she appealed to her dear
miss woodhouse  to say whether she had not good ground for hope 

 i never should have presumed to think of it at first   said she 
 but for you   you told me to observe him carefully  and let
his behaviour be the rule of mine  and so i have   but now i seem
to feel that i may deserve him  and that if he does chuse me 
it will not be any thing so very wonderful  

the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech  the many bitter
feelings  made the utmost exertion necessary on emma s side 
to enable her to say on reply 

 harriet  i will only venture to declare  that mr  knightley is
the last man in the world  who would intentionally give any woman
the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does  

harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory 
and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness  which at
that moment would have been dreadful penance  by the sound of her
father s footsteps   he was coming through the hall   harriet was
too much agitated to encounter him    she could not compose herself  
mr  woodhouse would be alarmed  she had better go    with most ready
encouragement from her friend  therefore  she passed off through
another door  and the moment she was gone  this was the spontaneous
burst of emma s feelings    oh god  that i had never seen her  

the rest of the day  the following night  were hardly enough
for her thoughts   she was bewildered amidst the confusion
of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours 
every moment had brought a fresh surprize  and every surprize
must be matter of humiliation to her   how to understand it all 
how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising
on herself  and living under   the blunders  the blindness of her
own head and heart   she sat still  she walked about  she tried her
own room  she tried the shrubbery  in every place  every posture 
she perceived that she had acted most weakly  that she had been imposed
on by others in a most mortifying degree  that she had been imposing
on herself in a degree yet more mortifying  that she was wretched 
and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness 

to understand  thoroughly understand her own heart  was the
first endeavour   to that point went every leisure moment which her
father s claims on her allowed  and every moment of involuntary
absence of mind 

how long had mr  knightley been so dear to her  as every feeling
declared him now to be   when had his influence  such influence begun   
when had he succeeded to that place in her affection  which frank
churchill had once  for a short period  occupied   she looked back 
she compared the two  compared them  as they had always stood in
her estimation  from the time of the latter s becoming known to her  
and as they must at any time have been compared by her  had it  
oh  had it  by any blessed felicity  occurred to her  to institute
the comparison   she saw that there never had been a time when she
did not consider mr  knightley as infinitely the superior  or when
his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear   she saw 
that in persuading herself  in fancying  in acting to the contrary 
she had been entirely under a delusion  totally ignorant of her
own heart  and  in short  that she had never really cared for frank
churchill at all 

this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection 
this was the knowledge of herself  on the first question of inquiry 
which she reached  and without being long in reaching it   
she was most sorrowfully indignant  ashamed of every sensation
but the one revealed to her  her affection for mr  knightley   
every other part of her mind was disgusting 

with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every
body s feelings  with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every
body s destiny   she was proved to have been universally mistaken 
and she had not quite done nothing  for she had done mischief 
she had brought evil on harriet  on herself  and she too much feared 
on mr  knightley   were this most unequal of all connexions to
take place  on her must rest all the reproach of having given it
a beginning  for his attachment  she must believe to be produced only
by a consciousness of harriet s   and even were this not the case 
he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly 

mr  knightley and harriet smith   it was a union to distance every
wonder of the kind   the attachment of frank churchill and jane
fairfax became commonplace  threadbare  stale in the comparison 
exciting no surprize  presenting no disparity  affording nothing
to be said or thought   mr  knightley and harriet smith   such an
elevation on her side   such a debasement on his   it was horrible
to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion 
to foresee the smiles  the sneers  the merriment it would prompt at
his expense  the mortification and disdain of his brother  the thousand
inconveniences to himself   could it be   no  it was impossible 
and yet it was far  very far  from impossible   was it a new
circumstance for a man of first rate abilities to be captivated by
very inferior powers   was it new for one  perhaps too busy to seek 
to be the prize of a girl who would seek him   was it new for any
thing in this world to be unequal  inconsistent  incongruous  or for
chance and circumstance  as second causes  to direct the human fate 

oh  had she never brought harriet forward   had she left her where
she ought  and where he had told her she ought   had she not 
with a folly which no tongue could express  prevented her marrying
the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy
and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong  
all would have been safe  none of this dreadful sequel would have been 

how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise
her thoughts to mr  knightley   how she could dare to fancy
herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it   
but harriet was less humble  had fewer scruples than formerly   
her inferiority  whether of mind or situation  seemed little felt   
she had seemed more sensible of mr  elton s being to stoop
in marrying her  than she now seemed of mr  knightley s   
alas  was not that her own doing too   who had been at pains to give
harriet notions of self consequence but herself   who but herself
had taught her  that she was to elevate herself if possible 
and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment   
if harriet  from being humble  were grown vain  it was her doing too 



chapter xii


till now that she was threatened with its loss  emma had never known
how much of her happiness depended on being  first  with mr  knightley 
first in interest and affection   satisfied that it was so 
and feeling it her due  she had enjoyed it without reflection 
and only in the dread of being supplanted  found how inexpressibly
important it had been   long  very long  she felt she had been first 
for  having no female connexions of his own  there had been
only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers  and she
had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella 
she had herself been first with him for many years past 
she had not deserved it  she had often been negligent or perverse 
slighting his advice  or even wilfully opposing him  insensible of
half his merits  and quarrelling with him because he would not
acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own  but still 
from family attachment and habit  and thorough excellence of mind 
he had loved her  and watched over her from a girl  with an endeavour
to improve her  and an anxiety for her doing right  which no
other creature had at all shared   in spite of all her faults 
she knew she was dear to him  might she not say  very dear   
when the suggestions of hope  however  which must follow here 
presented themselves  she could not presume to indulge them 
harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly 
exclusively  passionately loved by mr  knightley    she  could not 
she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment
to  her    she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality   
how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates   how directly 
how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject   not too
strongly for the offence  but far  far too strongly to issue from
any feeling softer than upright justice and clear sighted goodwill   
she had no hope  nothing to deserve the name of hope  that he could
have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question 
but there was a hope  at times a slight one  at times much stronger  
that harriet might have deceived herself  and be overrating his
regard for  her    wish it she must  for his sake  be the consequence
nothing to herself  but his remaining single all his life 
could she be secure of that  indeed  of his never marrying at all 
she believed she should be perfectly satisfied   let him but continue
the same mr  knightley to her and her father  the same mr  knightley
to all the world  let donwell and hartfield lose none of their
precious intercourse of friendship and confidence  and her peace
would be fully secured   marriage  in fact  would not do for her 
it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father  and with
what she felt for him   nothing should separate her from her father 
she would not marry  even if she were asked by mr  knightley 

it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed 
and she hoped  that when able to see them together again  she might at
least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were   she should
see them henceforward with the closest observance  and wretchedly
as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching 
she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here   
he was expected back every day   the power of observation would be
soon given  frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in
one course   in the meanwhile  she resolved against seeing harriet   
it would do neither of them good  it would do the subject no good 
to be talking of it farther   she was resolved not to be convinced 
as long as she could doubt  and yet had no authority for opposing
harriet s confidence   to talk would be only to irritate   she wrote
to her  therefore  kindly  but decisively  to beg that she would not 
at present  come to hartfield  acknowledging it to be her conviction 
that all farther confidential discussion of  one  topic had better
be avoided  and hoping  that if a few days were allowed to pass before
they met again  except in the company of others  she objected only
to a tete a tete  they might be able to act as if they had forgotten
the conversation of yesterday   harriet submitted  and approved 
and was grateful 

this point was just arranged  when a visitor arrived to tear emma s
thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them 
sleeping or waking  the last twenty four hours  mrs  weston  who had
been calling on her daughter in law elect  and took hartfield in her
way home  almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself 
to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview 

mr  weston had accompanied her to mrs  bates s  and gone through his
share of this essential attention most handsomely  but she having
then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing  was now returned
with much more to say  and much more to say with satisfaction 
than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs  bates s parlour  with all
the encumbrance of awkward feelings  could have afforded 

a little curiosity emma had  and she made the most of it while
her friend related   mrs  weston had set off to pay the visit
in a good deal of agitation herself  and in the first place had
wished not to go at all at present  to be allowed merely to write
to miss fairfax instead  and to defer this ceremonious call till
a little time had passed  and mr  churchill could be reconciled
to the engagement s becoming known  as  considering every thing 
she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports   
but mr  weston had thought differently  he was extremely anxious
to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family  and did not
conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it  or if it were 
that it would be of any consequence  for  such things   he observed 
 always got about    emma smiled  and felt that mr  weston had
very good reason for saying so   they had gone  in short  and very
great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady 
she had hardly been able to speak a word  and every look and action
had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness   the quiet 
heart felt satisfaction of the old lady  and the rapturous delight
of her daughter  who proved even too joyous to talk as usual 
had been a gratifying  yet almost an affecting  scene   they were
both so truly respectable in their happiness  so disinterested
in every sensation  thought so much of jane  so much of every body 
and so little of themselves  that every kindly feeling was at work
for them   miss fairfax s recent illness had offered a fair plea
for mrs  weston to invite her to an airing  she had drawn back and
declined at first  but  on being pressed had yielded  and  in the
course of their drive  mrs  weston had  by gentle encouragement 
overcome so much of her embarrassment  as to bring her to converse
on the important subject   apologies for her seemingly ungracious
silence in their first reception  and the warmest expressions of the
gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr  weston 
must necessarily open the cause  but when these effusions were put by 
they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state
of the engagement   mrs  weston was convinced that such conversation
must be the greatest relief to her companion  pent up within her own
mind as every thing had so long been  and was very much pleased
with all that she had said on the subject 

 on the misery of what she had suffered  during the concealment
of so many months   continued mrs  weston   she was energetic 
this was one of her expressions    i will not say  that since i
entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments  but i
can say  that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour    
and the quivering lip  emma  which uttered it  was an attestation
that i felt at my heart  

 poor girl   said emma    she thinks herself wrong  then  for having
consented to a private engagement  

 wrong   no one  i believe  can blame her more than she is disposed
to blame herself    the consequence   said she   has been a state
of perpetual suffering to me  and so it ought   but after all the
punishment that misconduct can bring  it is still not less misconduct 
pain is no expiation   i never can be blameless   i have been acting
contrary to all my sense of right  and the fortunate turn that every
thing has taken  and the kindness i am now receiving  is what my
conscience tells me ought not to be     do not imagine  madam  
she continued   that i was taught wrong   do not let any reflection
fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought
me up   the error has been all my own  and i do assure you that 
with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give 
i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell   

 poor girl   said emma again    she loves him then excessively 
i suppose   it must have been from attachment only  that she could
be led to form the engagement   her affection must have overpowered
her judgment  

 yes  i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him  

 i am afraid   returned emma  sighing   that i must often have
contributed to make her unhappy  

 on your side  my love  it was very innocently done   but she
probably had something of that in her thoughts  when alluding
to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before 
one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in  
she said   was that of making her  unreasonable    the consciousness
of having done amiss  had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes 
and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been  
that had been  hard for him to bear    i did not make the allowances  
said she   which i ought to have done  for his temper and spirits  
his delightful spirits  and that gaiety  that playfulness
of disposition  which  under any other circumstances  would  i am sure 
have been as constantly bewitching to me  as they were at first  
she then began to speak of you  and of the great kindness you
had shewn her during her illness  and with a blush which shewed me
how it was all connected  desired me  whenever i had an opportunity 
to thank you  i could not thank you too much  for every wish and
every endeavour to do her good   she was sensible that you had never
received any proper acknowledgment from herself  

 if i did not know her to be happy now   said emma  seriously 
 which  in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous
conscience  she must be  i could not bear these thanks   for  oh 
mrs  weston  if there were an account drawn up of the evil
and the good i have done miss fairfax   well  checking herself 
and trying to be more lively   this is all to be forgotten 
you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars 
they shew her to the greatest advantage   i am sure she is very good  
i hope she will be very happy   it is fit that the fortune
should be on his side  for i think the merit will be all on hers  

such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs  weston 
she thought well of frank in almost every respect  and  what was more 
she loved him very much  and her defence was  therefore  earnest 
she talked with a great deal of reason  and at least equal affection  
but she had too much to urge for emma s attention  it was soon gone
to brunswick square or to donwell  she forgot to attempt to listen 
and when mrs  weston ended with   we have not yet had the letter
we are so anxious for  you know  but i hope it will soon come  
she was obliged to pause before she answered  and at last obliged
to answer at random  before she could at all recollect what letter it
was which they were so anxious for 

 are you well  my emma   was mrs  weston s parting question 

 oh  perfectly   i am always well  you know   be sure to give me
intelligence of the letter as soon as possible  

mrs  weston s communications furnished emma with more food for
unpleasant reflection  by increasing her esteem and compassion 
and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax   she bitterly
regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her  and blushed
for the envious feelings which had certainly been  in some measure 
the cause   had she followed mr  knightley s known wishes  in paying
that attention to miss fairfax  which was every way her due  had she
tried to know her better  had she done her part towards intimacy 
had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith 
she must  in all probability  have been spared from every pain
which pressed on her now   birth  abilities  and education 
had been equally marking one as an associate for her  to be received
with gratitude  and the other  what was she   supposing even that
they had never become intimate friends  that she had never been
admitted into miss fairfax s confidence on this important matter  
which was most probable  still  in knowing her as she ought 
and as she might  she must have been preserved from the abominable
suspicions of an improper attachment to mr  dixon  which she had
not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself  but had so
unpardonably imparted  an idea which she greatly feared had been made
a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane s feelings 
by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill s   of all the sources
of evil surrounding the former  since her coming to highbury 
she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst 
she must have been a perpetual enemy   they never could have been
all three together  without her having stabbed jane fairfax s peace
in a thousand instances  and on box hill  perhaps  it had been
the agony of a mind that would bear no more 

the evening of this day was very long  and melancholy  at hartfield 
the weather added what it could of gloom   a cold stormy rain set in 
and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs  which the
wind was despoiling  and the length of the day  which only made
such cruel sights the longer visible 

the weather affected mr  woodhouse  and he could only be kept tolerably
comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter s side 
and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before 
it reminded her of their first forlorn tete a tete  on the evening
of mrs  weston s wedding day  but mr  knightley had walked
in then  soon after tea  and dissipated every melancholy fancy 
alas  such delightful proofs of hartfield s attraction  as those
sort of visits conveyed  might shortly be over   the picture which
she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter 
had proved erroneous  no friends had deserted them  no pleasures
had been lost   but her present forebodings she feared would
experience no similar contradiction   the prospect before her now 
was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled  
that might not be even partially brightened   if all took place
that might take place among the circle of her friends  hartfield must
be comparatively deserted  and she left to cheer her father with the
spirits only of ruined happiness 

the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer
than herself  and mrs  weston s heart and time would be occupied
by it   they should lose her  and  probably  in great measure 
her husband also   frank churchill would return among them no more 
and miss fairfax  it was reasonable to suppose  would soon cease
to belong to highbury   they would be married  and settled either
at or near enscombe   all that were good would be withdrawn  and if
to these losses  the loss of donwell were to be added  what would
remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach 
mr  knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort   
no longer walking in at all hours  as if ever willing to change
his own home for their s   how was it to be endured   and if he were
to be lost to them for harriet s sake  if he were to be thought
of hereafter  as finding in harriet s society all that he wanted 
if harriet were to be the chosen  the first  the dearest  the friend 
the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence 
what could be increasing emma s wretchedness but the reflection never far
distant from her mind  that it had been all her own work 

when it came to such a pitch as this  she was not able to refrain
from a start  or a heavy sigh  or even from walking about the room
for a few seconds  and the only source whence any thing like consolation
or composure could be drawn  was in the resolution of her own
better conduct  and the hope that  however inferior in spirit and
gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life
to the past  it would yet find her more rational  more acquainted
with herself  and leave her less to regret when it were gone 



chapter xiii


the weather continued much the same all the following morning 
and the same loneliness  and the same melancholy  seemed to
reign at hartfield  but in the afternoon it cleared  the wind
changed into a softer quarter  the clouds were carried off 
the sun appeared  it was summer again   with all the eagerness
which such a transition gives  emma resolved to be out of doors
as soon as possible   never had the exquisite sight  smell 
sensation of nature  tranquil  warm  and brilliant after a storm 
been more attractive to her   she longed for the serenity they might
gradually introduce  and on mr  perry s coming in soon after dinner 
with a disengaged hour to give her father  she lost no time ill
hurrying into the shrubbery   there  with spirits freshened 
and thoughts a little relieved  she had taken a few turns  when she
saw mr  knightley passing through the garden door  and coming
towards her   it was the first intimation of his being returned
from london   she had been thinking of him the moment before 
as unquestionably sixteen miles distant   there was time only for
the quickest arrangement of mind   she must be collected and calm 
in half a minute they were together   the  how d ye do s  were quiet
and constrained on each side   she asked after their mutual friends 
they were all well   when had he left them   only that morning 
he must have had a wet ride   yes   he meant to walk with her 
she found    he had just looked into the dining room  and as he
was not wanted there  preferred being out of doors    she thought
he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully  and the first possible
cause for it  suggested by her fears  was  that he had perhaps been
communicating his plans to his brother  and was pained by the manner
in which they had been received 

they walked together   he was silent   she thought he was often
looking at her  and trying for a fuller view of her face than it
suited her to give   and this belief produced another dread 
perhaps he wanted to speak to her  of his attachment to harriet 
he might be watching for encouragement to begin   she did not 
could not  feel equal to lead the way to any such subject 
he must do it all himself   yet she could not bear this silence 
with him it was most unnatural   she considered  resolved  and  trying
to smile  began  

 you have some news to hear  now you are come back  that will rather
surprize you  

 have i   said he quietly  and looking at her   of what nature  

 oh  the best nature in the world  a wedding  

after waiting a moment  as if to be sure she intended to say no more 
he replied 

 if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill  i have heard
that already  

 how is it possible   cried emma  turning her glowing cheeks
towards him  for  while she spoke  it occurred to her that he
might have called at mrs  goddard s in his way 

 i had a few lines on parish business from mr  weston this morning 
and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened  

emma was quite relieved  and could presently say  with a little
more composure 

  you  probably have been less surprized than any of us  for you have
had your suspicions   i have not forgotten that you once tried to give
me a caution   i wish i had attended to it  but   with a sinking
voice and a heavy sigh  i seem to have been doomed to blindness  

for a moment or two nothing was said  and she was unsuspicious
of having excited any particular interest  till she found her arm
drawn within his  and pressed against his heart  and heard him
thus saying  in a tone of great sensibility  speaking low 

 time  my dearest emma  time will heal the wound   your own
excellent sense  your exertions for your father s sake  i know
you will not allow yourself      her arm was pressed again 
as he added  in a more broken and subdued accent   the feelings
of the warmest friendship  indignation  abominable scoundrel    
and in a louder  steadier tone  he concluded with   he will soon
be gone   they will soon be in yorkshire   i am sorry for  her  
she deserves a better fate  

emma understood him  and as soon as she could recover from the
flutter of pleasure  excited by such tender consideration  replied 

 you are very kind  but you are mistaken  and i must set you right   
i am not in want of that sort of compassion   my blindness to what
was going on  led me to act by them in a way that i must always
be ashamed of  and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many
things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures  but i
have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier  

 emma   cried he  looking eagerly at her   are you  indeed    
but checking himself   no  no  i understand you  forgive me  i am
pleased that you can say even so much   he is no object of regret 
indeed  and it will not be very long  i hope  before that becomes
the acknowledgment of more than your reason   fortunate that your
affections were not farther entangled   i could never  i confess 
from your manners  assure myself as to the degree of what you felt  
i could only be certain that there was a preference  and a preference
which i never believed him to deserve   he is a disgrace to the name
of man   and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman   
jane  jane  you will be a miserable creature  

 mr  knightley   said emma  trying to be lively  but really confused  
 i am in a very extraordinary situation   i cannot let you continue in
your error  and yet  perhaps  since my manners gave such an impression 
i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have
been at all attached to the person we are speaking of  as it might
be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse   
but i never have  

he listened in perfect silence   she wished him to speak  but he
would not   she supposed she must say more before she were entitled
to his clemency  but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower
herself in his opinion   she went on  however 

 i have very little to say for my own conduct   i was tempted
by his attentions  and allowed myself to appear pleased   
an old story  probably  a common case  and no more than has happened
to hundreds of my sex before  and yet it may not be the more excusable
in one who sets up as i do for understanding   many circumstances
assisted the temptation   he was the son of mr  weston  he was
continually here  i always found him very pleasant  and  in short 
for  with a sigh  let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously 
they all centre in this at last  my vanity was flattered  and i
allowed his attentions   latterly  however  for some time  indeed  
i have had no idea of their meaning any thing   i thought them
a habit  a trick  nothing that called for seriousness on my side 
he has imposed on me  but he has not injured me   i have never been
attached to him   and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour 
he never wished to attach me   it was merely a blind to conceal
his real situation with another   it was his object to blind
all about him  and no one  i am sure  could be more effectually
blinded than myself  except that i was  not  blinded  that it was my
good fortune  that  in short  i was somehow or other safe from him  

she had hoped for an answer here  for a few words to say that her
conduct was at least intelligible  but he was silent  and  as far
as she could judge  deep in thought   at last  and tolerably
in his usual tone  he said 

 i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill   i can suppose 
however  that i may have underrated him   my acquaintance with
him has been but trifling   and even if i have not underrated
him hitherto  he may yet turn out well   with such a woman he has
a chance   i have no motive for wishing him ill  and for her sake 
whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct 
i shall certainly wish him well  

 i have no doubt of their being happy together   said emma 
 i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached  

 he is a most fortunate man   returned mr  knightley  with energy 
 so early in life  at three and twenty  a period when  if a man
chuses a wife  he generally chuses ill   at three and twenty
to have drawn such a prize   what years of felicity that man 
in all human calculation  has before him   assured of the love of
such a woman  the disinterested love  for jane fairfax s character
vouches for her disinterestedness  every thing in his favour   
equality of situation  i mean  as far as regards society  and all the
habits and manners that are important  equality in every point but one  
and that one  since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted 
such as must increase his felicity  for it will be his to bestow the
only advantages she wants   a man would always wish to give a woman
a better home than the one he takes her from  and he who can do it 
where there is no doubt of  her  regard  must  i think  be the happiest
of mortals   frank churchill is  indeed  the favourite of fortune 
every thing turns out for his good   he meets with a young woman
at a watering place  gains her affection  cannot even weary her
by negligent treatment  and had he and all his family sought round
the world for a perfect wife for him  they could not have found
her superior   his aunt is in the way   his aunt dies   he has
only to speak   his friends are eager to promote his happiness   
he had used every body ill  and they are all delighted to forgive him   
he is a fortunate man indeed  

 you speak as if you envied him  

 and i do envy him  emma   in one respect he is the object of my envy  

emma could say no more   they seemed to be within half a sentence
of harriet  and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject 
if possible   she made her plan  she would speak of something
totally different  the children in brunswick square  and she
only waited for breath to begin  when mr  knightley startled her 
by saying 

 you will not ask me what is the point of envy   you are determined 
i see  to have no curiosity   you are wise  but  i  cannot be wise 
emma  i must tell you what you will not ask  though i may wish it
unsaid the next moment  

 oh  then  don t speak it  don t speak it   she eagerly cried 
 take a little time  consider  do not commit yourself  

 thank you   said he  in an accent of deep mortification  and not
another syllable followed 

emma could not bear to give him pain   he was wishing to confide in her  
perhaps to consult her   cost her what it would  she would listen 
she might assist his resolution  or reconcile him to it 
she might give just praise to harriet  or  by representing to him
his own independence  relieve him from that state of indecision 
which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind
as his   they had reached the house 

 you are going in  i suppose   said he 

 no    replied emma  quite confirmed by the depressed manner
in which he still spoke   i should like to take another turn 
mr  perry is not gone    and  after proceeding a few steps  she added  
 i stopped you ungraciously  just now  mr  knightley  and  i am afraid 
gave you pain   but if you have any wish to speak openly to me
as a friend  or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have
in contemplation  as a friend  indeed  you may command me   i will
hear whatever you like   i will tell you exactly what i think  

 as a friend    repeated mr  knightley    emma  that i fear is
a word  no  i have no wish  stay  yes  why should i hesitate   
i have gone too far already for concealment   emma  i accept your offer  
extraordinary as it may seem  i accept it  and refer myself to you
as a friend   tell me  then  have i no chance of ever succeeding  

he stopped in his earnestness to look the question  and the expression
of his eyes overpowered her 

 my dearest emma   said he   for dearest you will always be 
whatever the event of this hour s conversation  my dearest 
most beloved emma  tell me at once   say  no   if it is to be said    
she could really say nothing    you are silent   he cried 
with great animation   absolutely silent  at present i ask no more  

emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment 
the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream  was perhaps
the most prominent feeling 

 i cannot make speeches  emma    he soon resumed  and in a tone
of such sincere  decided  intelligible tenderness as was
tolerably convincing    if i loved you less  i might be able
to talk about it more   but you know what i am   you hear nothing
but truth from me   i have blamed you  and lectured you  and you
have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it   
bear with the truths i would tell you now  dearest emma  as well as
you have borne with them   the manner  perhaps  may have as little
to recommend them   god knows  i have been a very indifferent lover   
but you understand me   yes  you see  you understand my feelings  
and will return them if you can   at present  i ask only to hear 
once to hear your voice  

while he spoke  emma s mind was most busy  and  with all the wonderful
velocity of thought  had been able  and yet without losing a word  
to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole  to see that
harriet s hopes had been entirely groundless  a mistake  a delusion 
as complete a delusion as any of her own  that harriet was nothing 
that she was every thing herself  that what she had been saying
relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her
own feelings  and that her agitation  her doubts  her reluctance 
her discouragement  had been all received as discouragement
from herself   and not only was there time for these convictions 
with all their glow of attendant happiness  there was time also to
rejoice that harriet s secret had not escaped her  and to resolve
that it need not  and should not   it was all the service she could
now render her poor friend  for as to any of that heroism of sentiment
which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection
from herself to harriet  as infinitely the most worthy of the two  
or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him
at once and for ever  without vouchsafing any motive  because he
could not marry them both  emma had it not   she felt for harriet 
with pain and with contrition  but no flight of generosity run mad 
opposing all that could be probable or reasonable  entered her brain 
she had led her friend astray  and it would be a reproach to
her for ever  but her judgment was as strong as her feelings 
and as strong as it had ever been before  in reprobating any such
alliance for him  as most unequal and degrading   her way was clear 
though not quite smooth   she spoke then  on being so entreated   
what did she say   just what she ought  of course   a lady always does   
she said enough to shew there need not be despair  and to invite him
to say more himself   he  had  despaired at one period  he had received
such an injunction to caution and silence  as for the time crushed
every hope   she had begun by refusing to hear him   the change had
perhaps been somewhat sudden   her proposal of taking another turn 
her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to 
might be a little extraordinary   she felt its inconsistency 
but mr  knightley was so obliging as to put up with it  and seek no
farther explanation 

seldom  very seldom  does complete truth belong to any human disclosure 
seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised 
or a little mistaken  but where  as in this case  though the conduct
is mistaken  the feelings are not  it may not be very material   
mr  knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than
she possessed  or a heart more disposed to accept of his 

he had  in fact  been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence 
he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it 
he had come  in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill s
engagement  with no selfish view  no view at all  but of endeavouring 
if she allowed him an opening  to soothe or to counsel her   the rest
had been the work of the moment  the immediate effect of what he heard 
on his feelings   the delightful assurance of her total indifference
towards frank churchill  of her having a heart completely disengaged
from him  had given birth to the hope  that  in time  he might gain
her affection himself   but it had been no present hope  he had only 
in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment  aspired to be
told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her   the superior
hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting   
the affection  which he had been asking to be allowed to create 
if he could  was already his   within half an hour  he had passed
from a thoroughly distressed state of mind  to something so like
perfect happiness  that it could bear no other name 

 her  change was equal   this one half hour had given to each the
same precious certainty of being beloved  had cleared from each
the same degree of ignorance  jealousy  or distrust   on his side 
there had been a long standing jealousy  old as the arrival 
or even the expectation  of frank churchill   he had been in love
with emma  and jealous of frank churchill  from about the same period 
one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other 
it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from
the country   the box hill party had decided him on going away 
he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted 
encouraged attentions   he had gone to learn to be indifferent   
but he had gone to a wrong place   there was too much domestic
happiness in his brother s house  woman wore too amiable a form in it 
isabella was too much like emma  differing only in those striking
inferiorities  which always brought the other in brilliancy before him 
for much to have been done  even had his time been longer   he had
stayed on  however  vigorously  day after day  till this very morning s
post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax   then  with the
gladness which must be felt  nay  which he did not scruple to feel 
having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma 
was there so much fond solicitude  so much keen anxiety for her 
that he could stay no longer   he had ridden home through the rain 
and had walked up directly after dinner  to see how this sweetest
and best of all creatures  faultless in spite of all her faults 
bore the discovery 

he had found her agitated and low   frank churchill was a villain   
he heard her declare that she had never loved him   frank churchill s
character was not desperate   she was his own emma  by hand and word 
when they returned into the house  and if he could have thought
of frank churchill then  he might have deemed him a very good sort
of fellow 



chapter xiv


what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house
from what she had brought out   she had then been only daring to hope
for a little respite of suffering   she was now in an exquisite
flutter of happiness  and such happiness moreover as she believed
must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away 

they sat down to tea  the same party round the same table  
how often it had been collected   and how often had her eyes fallen
on the same shrubs in the lawn  and observed the same beautiful
effect of the western sun   but never in such a state of spirits 
never in any thing like it  and it was with difficulty that she could
summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house 
or even the attentive daughter 

poor mr  woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him
in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming  and so
anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride   could he
have seen the heart  he would have cared very little for the lungs 
but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil 
without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in
the looks or ways of either  he repeated to them very comfortably
all the articles of news he had received from mr  perry  and talked
on with much self contentment  totally unsuspicious of what they
could have told him in return 

as long as mr  knightley remained with them  emma s fever continued 
but when he was gone  she began to be a little tranquillised
and subdued  and in the course of the sleepless night  which was
the tax for such an evening  she found one or two such very serious
points to consider  as made her feel  that even her happiness
must have some alloy   her father  and harriet   she could not be
alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims 
and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost  was the question 
with respect to her father  it was a question soon answered 
she hardly knew yet what mr  knightley would ask  but a very short
parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution
of never quitting her father   she even wept over the idea of it 
as a sin of thought   while he lived  it must be only an engagement 
but she flattered herself  that if divested of the danger of
drawing her away  it might become an increase of comfort to him   
how to do her best by harriet  was of more difficult decision   
how to spare her from any unnecessary pain  how to make
her any possible atonement  how to appear least her enemy   
on these subjects  her perplexity and distress were very great  
and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter
reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it   
she could only resolve at last  that she would still avoid a
meeting with her  and communicate all that need be told by letter 
that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just
now for a time from highbury  and  indulging in one scheme more  
nearly resolve  that it might be practicable to get an invitation
for her to brunswick square   isabella had been pleased with harriet 
and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement   
she did not think it in harriet s nature to escape being benefited
by novelty and variety  by the streets  the shops  and the children   
at any rate  it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself 
from whom every thing was due  a separation for the present  an averting
of the evil day  when they must all be together again 

she rose early  and wrote her letter to harriet  an employment
which left her so very serious  so nearly sad  that mr  knightley 
in walking up to hartfield to breakfast  did not arrive at all too soon 
and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again
with him  literally and figuratively  was quite necessary to reinstate
her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before 

he had not left her long  by no means long enough for her to have
the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else  when a letter
was brought her from randalls  a very thick letter   she guessed
what it must contain  and deprecated the necessity of reading it   
she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill  she wanted
no explanations  she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself  
and as for understanding any thing he wrote  she was sure she was
incapable of it   it must be waded through  however   she opened
the packet  it was too surely so   a note from mrs  weston to herself 
ushered in the letter from frank to mrs  weston 

 i have the greatest pleasure  my dear emma  in forwarding
to you the enclosed   i know what thorough justice you will
do it  and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect   i think
we shall never materially disagree about the writer again 
but i will not delay you by a long preface   we are quite well   
this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have
been feeling lately   i did not quite like your looks on tuesday 
but it was an ungenial morning  and though you will never own being
affected by weather  i think every body feels a north east wind   
i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday
afternoon and yesterday morning  but had the comfort of hearing
last night  by mr  perry  that it had not made him ill 
                               yours ever 
                                                        a  w  

                        to mrs  weston  
                                                       windsor july 
my dear madam 

 if i made myself intelligible yesterday  this letter will be expected 
but expected or not  i know it will be read with candour and indulgence   
you are all goodness  and i believe there will be need of even
all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct   
but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent 
my courage rises while i write   it is very difficult for the
prosperous to be humble   i have already met with such success
in two applications for pardon  that i may be in danger of thinking
myself too sure of yours  and of those among your friends who have
had any ground of offence   you must all endeavour to comprehend
the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls 
you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept
at all hazards   this was the fact   my right to place myself
in a situation requiring such concealment  is another question 
i shall not discuss it here   for my temptation to  think  it a right 
i refer every caviller to a brick house  sashed windows below 
and casements above  in highbury   i dared not address her openly 
my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well
known to require definition  and i was fortunate enough to prevail 
before we parted at weymouth  and to induce the most upright female
mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement   
had she refused  i should have gone mad   but you will be ready to say 
what was your hope in doing this   what did you look forward to   
to any thing  every thing  to time  chance  circumstance  slow effects 
sudden bursts  perseverance and weariness  health and sickness 
every possibility of good was before me  and the first of blessings
secured  in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence 
if you need farther explanation  i have the honour  my dear madam 
of being your husband s son  and the advantage of inheriting
a disposition to hope for good  which no inheritance of houses
or lands can ever equal the value of   see me  then  under these
circumstances  arriving on my first visit to randalls   and here i
am conscious of wrong  for that visit might have been sooner paid 
you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax
was in highbury  and as  you  were the person slighted  you will
forgive me instantly  but i must work on my father s compassion 
by reminding him  that so long as i absented myself from his house 
so long i lost the blessing of knowing you   my behaviour 
during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you  did not 
i hope  lay me open to reprehension  excepting on one point 
and now i come to the principal  the only important part of my
conduct while belonging to you  which excites my own anxiety 
or requires very solicitous explanation   with the greatest respect 
and the warmest friendship  do i mention miss woodhouse  my father
perhaps will think i ought to add  with the deepest humiliation   
a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion 
and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to   my behaviour
to miss woodhouse indicated  i believe  more than it ought   
in order to assist a concealment so essential to me  i was led
on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy
into which we were immediately thrown   i cannot deny that miss
woodhouse was my ostensible object  but i am sure you will believe
the declaration  that had i not been convinced of her indifference 
i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on   
amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is  she never gave me
the idea of a young woman likely to be attached  and that she was
perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me  was as much
my conviction as my wish   she received my attentions with an easy 
friendly  goodhumoured playfulness  which exactly suited me 
we seemed to understand each other   from our relative situation 
those attentions were her due  and were felt to be so   whether miss
woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of
that fortnight  i cannot say   when i called to take leave of her 
i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth 
and i then fancied she was not without suspicion  but i have no
doubt of her having since detected me  at least in some degree   
she may not have surmised the whole  but her quickness must
have penetrated a part   i cannot doubt it   you will find 
whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints 
that it did not take her wholly by surprize   she frequently gave
me hints of it   i remember her telling me at the ball  that i
owed mrs  elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax   
i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted
by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss 
while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse 
i could deserve nothing from either   acquit me here  and procure
for me  when it is allowable  the acquittal and good wishes of that
said emma woodhouse  whom i regard with so much brotherly affection 
as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself   
whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight  you have
now a key to   my heart was in highbury  and my business was to get
my body thither as often as might be  and with the least suspicion 
if you remember any queernesses  set them all to the right account   
of the pianoforte so much talked of  i feel it only necessary to say 
that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f    who would
never have allowed me to send it  had any choice been given her   
the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement 
my dear madam  is much beyond my power of doing justice to 
you will soon  i earnestly hope  know her thoroughly yourself   
no description can describe her   she must tell you herself what she is  
yet not by word  for never was there a human creature who would
so designedly suppress her own merit   since i began this letter 
which will be longer than i foresaw  i have heard from her   
she gives a good account of her own health  but as she never complains 
i dare not depend   i want to have your opinion of her looks 
i know you will soon call on her  she is living in dread of the visit 
perhaps it is paid already   let me hear from you without delay 
i am impatient for a thousand particulars   remember how few
minutes i was at randalls  and in how bewildered  how mad a state 
and i am not much better yet  still insane either from happiness
or misery   when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with 
of her excellence and patience  and my uncle s generosity  i am mad
with joy   but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her 
and how little i deserve to be forgiven  i am mad with anger 
if i could but see her again   but i must not propose it yet 
my uncle has been too good for me to encroach   i must still add
to this long letter   you have not heard all that you ought to hear 
i could not give any connected detail yesterday  but the suddenness 
and  in one light  the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out 
needs explanation  for though the event of the 26th ult   as you
will conclude  immediately opened to me the happiest prospects 
i should not have presumed on such early measures  but from the
very particular circumstances  which left me not an hour to lose 
i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty  and she would have
felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement   
but i had no choice   the hasty engagement she had entered into with
that woman  here  my dear madam  i was obliged to leave off abruptly 
to recollect and compose myself   i have been walking over the country 
and am now  i hope  rational enough to make the rest of my letter
what it ought to be   it is  in fact  a most mortifying retrospect
for me   i behaved shamefully   and here i can admit  that my manners
to miss w   in being unpleasant to miss f   were highly blameable 
 she  disapproved them  which ought to have been enough   my plea of
concealing the truth she did not think sufficient   she was displeased 
i thought unreasonably so   i thought her  on a thousand occasions 
unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious   i thought her even cold 
but she was always right   if i had followed her judgment  and subdued
my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper  i should have
escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known   we quarrelled   
do you remember the morning spent at donwell    there  every little
dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis   i was late 
i met her walking home by herself  and wanted to walk with her 
but she would not suffer it   she absolutely refused to allow me 
which i then thought most unreasonable   now  however  i see nothing
in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion 
while i  to blind the world to our engagement  was behaving one
hour with objectionable particularity to another woman  was she
to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made
every previous caution useless   had we been met walking together
between donwell and highbury  the truth must have been suspected   
i was mad enough  however  to resent   i doubted her affection 
i doubted it more the next day on box hill  when  provoked by
such conduct on my side  such shameful  insolent neglect of her 
and such apparent devotion to miss w   as it would have been
impossible for any woman of sense to endure  she spoke her
resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me   
in short  my dear madam  it was a quarrel blameless on her side 
abominable on mine  and i returned the same evening to richmond 
though i might have staid with you till the next morning 
merely because i would be as angry with her as possible   even then 
i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time 
but i was the injured person  injured by her coldness  and i went
away determined that she should make the first advances   i shall
always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party 
had you witnessed my behaviour there  i can hardly suppose you would
ever have thought well of me again   its effect upon her appears
in the immediate resolution it produced   as soon as she found i
was really gone from randalls  she closed with the offer of that
officious mrs  elton  the whole system of whose treatment of her 
by the bye  has ever filled me with indignation and hatred 
i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been
so richly extended towards myself  but  otherwise  i should loudly
protest against the share of it which that woman has known   
 jane   indeed   you will observe that i have not yet indulged myself
in calling her by that name  even to you   think  then  what i must
have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all
the vulgarity of needless repetition  and all the insolence of
imaginary superiority   have patience with me  i shall soon have done   
she closed with this offer  resolving to break with me entirely 
and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again   
 she   felt   the   engagement   to   be   a   source   of   repentance   and   misery 
 to   each     she   dissolved   it    this letter reached me on the very
morning of my poor aunt s death   i answered it within an hour 
but from the confusion of my mind  and the multiplicity of business
falling on me at once  my answer  instead of being sent with all
the many other letters of that day  was locked up in my writing desk 
and i  trusting that i had written enough  though but a few lines 
to satisfy her  remained without any uneasiness   i was rather
disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily 
but i made excuses for her  and was too busy  and  may i add   
too cheerful in my views to be captious   we removed to windsor 
and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her  my own letters
all returned   and a few lines at the same time by the post 
stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply
to her last  and adding  that as silence on such a point could
not be misconstrued  and as it must be equally desirable to both
to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible 
she now sent me  by a safe conveyance  all my letters  and requested 
that if i could not directly command hers  so as to send them
to highbury within a week  i would forward them after that period
to her at     in short  the full direction to mr  smallridge s 
near bristol  stared me in the face   i knew the name  the place 
i knew all about it  and instantly saw what she had been doing 
it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character
which i knew her to possess  and the secrecy she had maintained 
as to any such design in her former letter  was equally descriptive
of its anxious delicacy   for the world would not she have seemed
to threaten me   imagine the shock  imagine how  till i had actually
detected my own blunder  i raved at the blunders of the post   
what was to be done   one thing only   i must speak to my uncle 
without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again   
i spoke  circumstances were in my favour  the late event had softened
away his pride  and he was  earlier than i could have anticipated 
wholly reconciled and complying  and could say at last  poor man 
with a deep sigh  that he wished i might find as much happiness
in the marriage state as he had done   i felt that it would be
of a different sort   are you disposed to pity me for what i must
have suffered in opening the cause to him  for my suspense while
all was at stake   no  do not pity me till i reached highbury 
and saw how ill i had made her   do not pity me till i saw her wan 
sick looks   i reached highbury at the time of day when  from my
knowledge of their late breakfast hour  i was certain of a good chance
of finding her alone   i was not disappointed  and at last i was
not disappointed either in the object of my journey   a great deal
of very reasonable  very just displeasure i had to persuade away 
but it is done  we are reconciled  dearer  much dearer  than ever 
and no moment s uneasiness can ever occur between us again   now  my
dear madam  i will release you  but i could not conclude before 
a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have
ever shewn me  and ten thousand for the attentions your heart
will dictate towards her   if you think me in a way to be happier
than i deserve  i am quite of your opinion   miss w  calls me
the child of good fortune   i hope she is right   in one respect 
my good fortune is undoubted  that of being able to subscribe
myself 
                    your obliged and affectionate son

chapter xv


this letter must make its way to emma s feelings   she was obliged 
in spite of her previous determination to the contrary  to do
it all the justice that mrs  weston foretold   as soon as she
came to her own name  it was irresistible  every line relating
to herself was interesting  and almost every line agreeable 
and when this charm ceased  the subject could still maintain itself 
by the natural return of her former regard for the writer  and the
very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at
that moment   she never stopt till she had gone through the whole 
and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong 
yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed  and he had suffered 
and was very sorry  and he was so grateful to mrs  weston 
and so much in love with miss fairfax  and she was so happy herself 
that there was no being severe  and could he have entered the room 
she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever 

she thought so well of the letter  that when mr  knightley came again 
she desired him to read it   she was sure of mrs  weston s wishing
it to be communicated  especially to one  who  like mr  knightley 
had seen so much to blame in his conduct 

 i shall be very glad to look it over   said he   but it seems long 
i will take it home with me at night  

but that would not do   mr  weston was to call in the evening 
and she must return it by him 

 i would rather be talking to you   he replied   but as it seems
a matter of justice  it shall be done  

he began  stopping  however  almost directly to say   had i been offered
the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few
months ago  emma  it would not have been taken with such indifference  

he proceeded a little farther  reading to himself  and then 
with a smile  observed   humph  a fine complimentary opening 
but it is his way   one man s style must not be the rule of another s 
we will not be severe  

 it will be natural for me   he added shortly afterwards   to speak my
opinion aloud as i read   by doing it  i shall feel that i am near you 
it will not be so great a loss of time   but if you dislike it   

 not at all   i should wish it  

mr  knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity 

 he trifles here   said he   as to the temptation   he knows
he is wrong  and has nothing rational to urge   bad   he ought
not to have formed the engagement    his father s disposition    
he is unjust  however  to his father   mr  weston s sanguine
temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions 
but mr  weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured
to gain it   very true  he did not come till miss fairfax was here  

 and i have not forgotten   said emma   how sure you were that he
might have come sooner if he would   you pass it over very handsomely  
but you were perfectly right  

 i was not quite impartial in my judgment  emma   but yet  i think  
had  you  not been in the case  i should still have distrusted him  

when he came to miss woodhouse  he was obliged to read the whole
of it aloud  all that related to her  with a smile  a look 
a shake of the head  a word or two of assent  or disapprobation 
or merely of love  as the subject required  concluding  however 
seriously  and  after steady reflection  thus  

 very bad  though it might have been worse   playing a most
dangerous game   too much indebted to the event for his acquittal   
no judge of his own manners by you   always deceived in fact by his
own wishes  and regardless of little besides his own convenience   
fancying you to have fathomed his secret   natural enough   
his own mind full of intrigue  that he should suspect it
in others   mystery  finesse  how they pervert the understanding 
my emma  does not every thing serve to prove more and more the
beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other  

emma agreed to it  and with a blush of sensibility on harriet s account 
which she could not give any sincere explanation of 

 you had better go on   said she 

he did so  but very soon stopt again to say   the pianoforte 
ah   that was the act of a very  very young man  one too young
to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much
exceed the pleasure   a boyish scheme  indeed   i cannot
comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection
which he knows she would rather dispense with  and he did
know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could  

after this  he made some progress without any pause 
frank churchill s confession of having behaved shamefully
was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing 

 i perfectly agree with you  sir    was then his remark 
 you did behave very shamefully   you never wrote a truer line  
and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis
of their disagreement  and his persisting to act in direct
opposition to jane fairfax s sense of right  he made a fuller pause
to say   this is very bad   he had induced her to place herself 
for his sake  in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness 
and it should have been his first object to prevent her from
suffering unnecessarily   she must have had much more to contend with 
in carrying on the correspondence  than he could   he should have
respected even unreasonable scruples  had there been such  but hers
were all reasonable   we must look to her one fault  and remember
that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement 
to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment  

emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party 
and grew uncomfortable   her own behaviour had been so very improper 
she was deeply ashamed  and a little afraid of his next look 
it was all read  however  steadily  attentively  and without
the smallest remark  and  excepting one momentary glance at her 
instantly withdrawn  in the fear of giving pain  no remembrance
of box hill seemed to exist 

 there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends 
the eltons   was his next observation    his feelings are natural   
what  actually resolve to break with him entirely   she felt
the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each  
she dissolved it   what a view this gives of her sense of
his behaviour   well  he must be a most extraordinary   

 nay  nay  read on   you will find how very much he suffers  

 i hope he does   replied mr  knightley coolly  and resuming the letter 
  smallridge    what does this mean   what is all this  

 she had engaged to go as governess to mrs  smallridge s children  
a dear friend of mrs  elton s  a neighbour of maple grove  and 
by the bye  i wonder how mrs  elton bears the disappointment  

 say nothing  my dear emma  while you oblige me to read  not even
of mrs  elton   only one page more   i shall soon have done 
what a letter the man writes  

 i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him  

 well  there  is  feeling here   he does seem to have suffered in finding
her ill   certainly  i can have no doubt of his being fond of her 
 dearer  much dearer than ever    i hope he may long continue to feel
all the value of such a reconciliation   he is a very liberal thanker 
with his thousands and tens of thousands    happier than i deserve  
come  he knows himself there    miss woodhouse calls me the child
of good fortune    those were miss woodhouse s words  were they   
and a fine ending  and there is the letter   the child of good fortune 
that was your name for him  was it  

 you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am 
but still you must  at least i hope you must  think the better
of him for it   i hope it does him some service with you  

 yes  certainly it does   he has had great faults  faults of
inconsideration and thoughtlessness  and i am very much of his
opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves 
but still as he is  beyond a doubt  really attached to miss fairfax 
and will soon  it may be hoped  have the advantage of being constantly
with her  i am very ready to believe his character will improve 
and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle
that it wants   and now  let me talk to you of something else 
i have another person s interest at present so much at heart 
that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill   ever since i
left you this morning  emma  my mind has been hard at work on
one subject  

the subject followed  it was in plain  unaffected  gentlemanlike english 
such as mr  knightley used even to the woman he was in love with 
how to be able to ask her to marry him  without attacking the
happiness of her father   emma s answer was ready at the first word 
 while her dear father lived  any change of condition must be impossible
for her   she could never quit him    part only of this answer 
however  was admitted   the impossibility of her quitting her father 
mr  knightley felt as strongly as herself  but the inadmissibility
of any other change  he could not agree to   he had been thinking
it over most deeply  most intently  he had at first hoped to induce
mr  woodhouse to remove with her to donwell  he had wanted to believe
it feasible  but his knowledge of mr  woodhouse would not suffer
him to deceive himself long  and now he confessed his persuasion 
that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father s comfort 
perhaps even of his life  which must not be hazarded   mr  woodhouse
taken from hartfield   no  he felt that it ought not to be attempted 
but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this  he trusted
his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable 
it was  that he should be received at hartfield  that so long as
her father s happiness in other words his life  required hartfield
to continue her home  it should be his likewise 

of their all removing to donwell  emma had already had her own
passing thoughts   like him  she had tried the scheme and rejected it 
but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her 
she was sensible of all the affection it evinced   she felt that 
in quitting donwell  he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence
of hours and habits  that in living constantly with her father 
and in no house of his own  there would be much  very much 
to be borne with   she promised to think of it  and advised him
to think of it more  but he was fully convinced  that no reflection
could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject   he had
given it  he could assure her  very long and calm consideration 
he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning 
to have his thoughts to himself 

 ah  there is one difficulty unprovided for   cried emma    i am
sure william larkins will not like it   you must get his consent
before you ask mine  

she promised  however  to think of it  and pretty nearly promised  moreover 
to think of it  with the intention of finding it a very good scheme 

it is remarkable  that emma  in the many  very many  points of view
in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey  was never
struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry  whose rights
as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded 
think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy 
and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it 
and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent
dislike of mr  knightley s marrying jane fairfax  or any body else 
which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of
the sister and the aunt 

this proposal of his  this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield  
the more she contemplated it  the more pleasing it became 
his evils seemed to lessen  her own advantages to increase 
their mutual good to outweigh every drawback   such a companion
for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her   
such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be
giving increase of melancholy 

she would have been too happy but for poor harriet  but every
blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings
of her friend  who must now be even excluded from hartfield 
the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself 
poor harriet must  in mere charitable caution  be kept at a
distance from   she would be a loser in every way   emma could not
deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment 
in such a party  harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise 
but for the poor girl herself  it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity
that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment 

in time  of course  mr  knightley would be forgotten  that is 
supplanted  but this could not be expected to happen very early 
mr  knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure   
not like mr  elton   mr  knightley  always so kind  so feeling 
so truly considerate for every body  would never deserve to be
less worshipped than now  and it really was too much to hope even
of harriet  that she could be in love with more than  three  men
in one year 



chapter xvi


it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous
as herself to avoid a meeting   their intercourse was painful
enough by letter   how much worse  had they been obliged to meet 

harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed 
without reproaches  or apparent sense of ill usage  and yet emma fancied
there was a something of resentment  a something bordering on it in
her style  which increased the desirableness of their being separate   
it might be only her own consciousness  but it seemed as if an
angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke 

she had no difficulty in procuring isabella s invitation 
and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it 
without resorting to invention   there was a tooth amiss 
harriet really wished  and had wished some time  to consult a dentist 
mrs  john knightley was delighted to be of use  any thing of ill
health was a recommendation to her  and though not so fond of a
dentist as of a mr  wingfield  she was quite eager to have harriet
under her care   when it was thus settled on her sister s side 
emma proposed it to her friend  and found her very persuadable   
harriet was to go  she was invited for at least a fortnight  she was
to be conveyed in mr  woodhouse s carriage   it was all arranged 
it was all completed  and harriet was safe in brunswick square 

now emma could  indeed  enjoy mr  knightley s visits  now she
could talk  and she could listen with true happiness  unchecked by
that sense of injustice  of guilt  of something most painful 
which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was
near her  how much might at that moment  and at a little distance 
be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself 

the difference of harriet at mrs  goddard s  or in london  made perhaps
an unreasonable difference in emma s sensations  but she could not
think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment 
which must be averting the past  and carrying her out of herself 

she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place
in her mind which harriet had occupied   there was a communication
before her  one which  she  only could be competent to make  
the confession of her engagement to her father  but she would
have nothing to do with it at present   she had resolved to defer
the disclosure till mrs  weston were safe and well   no additional
agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved  
and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the
appointed time   a fortnight  at least  of leisure and peace of mind 
to crown every warmer  but more agitating  delight  should be hers 

she soon resolved  equally as a duty and a pleasure  to employ half
an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax   
she ought to go  and she was longing to see her  the resemblance of
their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill 
it would be a  secret  satisfaction  but the consciousness of a
similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with
which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate 

she went  she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door  but had
not been into the house since the morning after box hill  when poor
jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion 
though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected   
the fear of being still unwelcome  determined her  though assured
of their being at home  to wait in the passage  and send up her name   
she heard patty announcing it  but no such bustle succeeded as poor
miss bates had before made so happily intelligible   no  she heard
nothing but the instant reply of   beg her to walk up    and a moment
afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself  coming eagerly
forward  as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient   
emma had never seen her look so well  so lovely  so engaging 
there was consciousness  animation  and warmth  there was every
thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted   
she came forward with an offered hand  and said  in a low  but very
feeling tone 

 this is most kind  indeed   miss woodhouse  it is impossible
for me to express  i hope you will believe  excuse me for being
so entirely without words  

emma was gratified  and would soon have shewn no want of words 
if the sound of mrs  elton s voice from the sitting room had not
checked her  and made it expedient to compress all her friendly
and all her congratulatory sensations into a very  very earnest
shake of the hand 

mrs  bates and mrs  elton were together   miss bates was out 
which accounted for the previous tranquillity   emma could have
wished mrs  elton elsewhere  but she was in a humour to have patience
with every body  and as mrs  elton met her with unusual graciousness 
she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm 

she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs  elton s thoughts 
and understand why she was  like herself  in happy spirits 
it was being in miss fairfax s confidence  and fancying herself
acquainted with what was still a secret to other people 
emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face 
and while paying her own compliments to mrs  bates  and appearing
to attend to the good old lady s replies  she saw her with a sort
of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently
been reading aloud to miss fairfax  and return it into the purple
and gold reticule by her side  saying  with significant nods 

 we can finish this some other time  you know   you and i shall
not want opportunities   and  in fact  you have heard all the
essential already   i only wanted to prove to you that mrs  s  admits
our apology  and is not offended   you see how delightfully
she writes   oh  she is a sweet creature   you would have doated
on her  had you gone   but not a word more   let us be discreet  
quite on our good behaviour   hush   you remember those lines  
i forget the poem at this moment 

         for when a lady s in the case 
         you know all other things give place  

now i say  my dear  in  our  case  for  lady   read    mum  a word
to the wise   i am in a fine flow of spirits  an t i   but i want
to set your heart at ease as to mrs  s    my  representation  you see 
has quite appeased her  

and again  on emma s merely turning her head to look
at mrs  bates s knitting  she added  in a half whisper 

 i mentioned no  names   you will observe   oh  no  cautious as
a minister of state   i managed it extremely well  

emma could not doubt   it was a palpable display  repeated on every
possible occasion   when they had all talked a little while in harmony
of the weather and mrs  weston  she found herself abruptly addressed with 

 do not you think  miss woodhouse  our saucy little friend here is
charmingly recovered   do not you think her cure does perry the
highest credit    here was a side glance of great meaning at jane  
upon my word  perry has restored her in a wonderful short time   
oh  if you had seen her  as i did  when she was at the worst    
and when mrs  bates was saying something to emma  whispered farther 
 we do not say a word of any  assistance  that perry might have 
not a word of a certain young physician from windsor   oh  no 
perry shall have all the credit  

 i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you  miss woodhouse  
she shortly afterwards began   since the party to box hill 
very pleasant party   but yet i think there was something wanting 
things did not seem  that is  there seemed a little cloud upon
the spirits of some   so it appeared to me at least  but i might
be mistaken   however  i think it answered so far as to tempt one
to go again   what say you both to our collecting the same party 
and exploring to box hill again  while the fine weather lasts   
it must be the same party  you know  quite the same party 
not  one  exception  

soon after this miss bates came in  and emma could not help being diverted
by the perplexity of her first answer to herself  resulting  she supposed 
from doubt of what might be said  and impatience to say every thing 

 thank you  dear miss woodhouse  you are all kindness   it is impossible
to say  yes  indeed  i quite understand  dearest jane s prospects  
that is  i do not mean   but she is charmingly recovered   
how is mr  woodhouse   i am so glad   quite out of my power   
such a happy little circle as you find us here   yes  indeed   
charming young man   that is  so very friendly  i mean good mr  perry   
such attention to jane    and from her great  her more than commonly
thankful delight towards mrs  elton for being there  emma guessed
that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane 
from the vicarage quarter  which was now graciously overcome   
after a few whispers  indeed  which placed it beyond a guess 
mrs  elton  speaking louder  said 

 yes  here i am  my good friend  and here i have been so long 
that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise 
but  the truth is  that i am waiting for my lord and master 
he promised to join me here  and pay his respects to you  

 what  are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr  elton   
that will be a favour indeed  for i know gentlemen do not like
morning visits  and mr  elton s time is so engaged  

 upon my word it is  miss bates   he really is engaged from morning
to night   there is no end of people s coming to him  on some pretence
or other   the magistrates  and overseers  and churchwardens 
are always wanting his opinion   they seem not able to do any thing
without him    upon my word  mr  e    i often say   rather you than i   
i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument 
if i had half so many applicants    bad enough as it is  for i
absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree   i believe
i have not played a bar this fortnight   however  he is coming 
i assure you   yes  indeed  on purpose to wait on you all    and putting
up her hand to screen her words from emma   a congratulatory visit 
you know   oh  yes  quite indispensable  

miss bates looked about her  so happily   

 he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself
from knightley  but he and knightley are shut up together
in deep consultation   mr  e  is knightley s right hand  

emma would not have smiled for the world  and only said   is mr  elton
gone on foot to donwell   he will have a hot walk  

 oh  no  it is a meeting at the crown  a regular meeting 
weston and cole will be there too  but one is apt to speak only
of those who lead   i fancy mr  e  and knightley have every thing
their own way  

 have not you mistaken the day   said emma    i am almost certain
that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow   mr  knightley
was at hartfield yesterday  and spoke of it as for saturday  

 oh  no  the meeting is certainly to day   was the abrupt answer 
which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs  elton s side   
 i do believe   she continued   this is the most troublesome parish
that ever was   we never heard of such things at maple grove  

 your parish there was small   said jane 

 upon my word  my dear  i do not know  for i never heard the subject
talked of  

 but it is proved by the smallness of the school  which i have heard
you speak of  as under the patronage of your sister and mrs  bragge 
the only school  and not more than five and twenty children  

 ah  you clever creature  that s very true   what a thinking brain
you have   i say  jane  what a perfect character you and i should make 
if we could be shaken together   my liveliness and your solidity
would produce perfection   not that i presume to insinuate  however 
that  some  people may not think  you  perfection already   but hush   
not a word  if you please  

it seemed an unnecessary caution  jane was wanting to give her words 
not to mrs  elton  but to miss woodhouse  as the latter plainly saw 
the wish of distinguishing her  as far as civility permitted 
was very evident  though it could not often proceed beyond a look 

mr  elton made his appearance   his lady greeted him with some
of her sparkling vivacity 

 very pretty  sir  upon my word  to send me on here  to be an
encumbrance to my friends  so long before you vouchsafe to come   
but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with 
you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared   
here have i been sitting this hour  giving these young ladies
a sample of true conjugal obedience  for who can say  you know 
how soon it may be wanted  

mr  elton was so hot and tired  that all this wit seemed thrown away 
his civilities to the other ladies must be paid  but his subsequent
object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering 
and the walk he had had for nothing 

 when i got to donwell   said he   knightley could not be found 
very odd  very unaccountable  after the note i sent him this morning 
and the message he returned  that he should certainly be at home
till one  

 donwell   cried his wife    my dear mr  e   you have not been
to donwell   you mean the crown  you come from the meeting at the crown  

 no  no  that s to morrow  and i particularly wanted to see knightley
to day on that very account   such a dreadful broiling morning   
i went over the fields too   speaking in a tone of great ill usage  
which made it so much the worse   and then not to find him at home 
i assure you i am not at all pleased   and no apology left  no message
for me   the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected   
very extraordinary   and nobody knew at all which way he was gone 
perhaps to hartfield  perhaps to the abbey mill  perhaps into his woods   
miss woodhouse  this is not like our friend knightley   can you
explain it  

emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary 
indeed  and that she had not a syllable to say for him 

 i cannot imagine   said mrs  elton   feeling the indignity as a wife
ought to do    i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you 
of all people in the world   the very last person whom one should expect
to be forgotten   my dear mr  e   he must have left a message for you 
i am sure he must   not even knightley could be so very eccentric   
and his servants forgot it   depend upon it  that was the case 
and very likely to happen with the donwell servants  who are all 
i have often observed  extremely awkward and remiss   i am sure i
would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard
for any consideration   and as for mrs  hodges  wright holds
her very cheap indeed   she promised wright a receipt  and never
sent it  

 i met william larkins   continued mr  elton   as i got near
the house  and he told me i should not find his master at home 
but i did not believe him   william seemed rather out of humour 
he did not know what was come to his master lately  he said  but he
could hardly ever get the speech of him   i have nothing to do with
william s wants  but it really is of very great importance that  i 
should see knightley to day  and it becomes a matter  therefore 
of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk
to no purpose  

emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly 
in all probability she was at this very time waited for there 
and mr  knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression
towards mr  elton  if not towards william larkins 

she was pleased  on taking leave  to find miss fairfax determined
to attend her out of the room  to go with her even downstairs 
it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of 
to say 

 it is as well  perhaps  that i have not had the possibility 
had you not been surrounded by other friends  i might have been
tempted to introduce a subject  to ask questions  to speak more
openly than might have been strictly correct   i feel that i should
certainly have been impertinent  

 oh   cried jane  with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought
infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her
usual composure   there would have been no danger   the danger
would have been of my wearying you   you could not have gratified
me more than by expressing an interest     indeed  miss woodhouse 
 speaking more collectedly   with the consciousness which i
have of misconduct  very great misconduct  it is particularly
consoling to me to know that those of my friends  whose good
opinion is most worth preserving  are not disgusted to such a
degree as to  i have not time for half that i could wish to say 
i long to make apologies  excuses  to urge something for myself 
i feel it so very due   but  unfortunately  in short  if your
compassion does not stand my friend   

 oh  you are too scrupulous  indeed you are   cried emma warmly 
and taking her hand    you owe me no apologies  and every body to
whom you might be supposed to owe them  is so perfectly satisfied 
so delighted even   

 you are very kind  but i know what my manners were to you   
so cold and artificial   i had always a part to act   it was a life
of deceit   i know that i must have disgusted you  

 pray say no more   i feel that all the apologies should be on my side 
let us forgive each other at once   we must do whatever is to be
done quickest  and i think our feelings will lose no time there 
i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor  

 very  

 and the next news  i suppose  will be  that we are to lose you  
just as i begin to know you  

 oh  as to all that  of course nothing can be thought of yet 
i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs  campbell  

 nothing can be actually settled yet  perhaps   replied emma 
smiling   but  excuse me  it must be thought of  

the smile was returned as jane answered 

 you are very right  it has been thought of   and i will own
to you   i am sure it will be safe   that so far as our living
with mr  churchill at enscombe  it is settled   there must be
three months  at least  of deep mourning  but when they are over 
i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for  

 thank you  thank you   this is just what i wanted to be assured of   
oh  if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open   
good bye  good bye  



chapter xvii


mrs  weston s friends were all made happy by her safety 
and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased
to emma  it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl 
she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston   she would
not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match
for her  hereafter  with either of isabella s sons  but she was
convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best 
it would be a great comfort to mr  weston  as he grew older  
and even mr  weston might be growing older ten years hence  to have
his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense  the freaks
and the fancies of a child never banished from home  and mrs  weston  
no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her  and it
would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach 
should not have their powers in exercise again 

 she has had the advantage  you know  of practising on me  
she continued   like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis 
in madame de genlis  adelaide and theodore  and we shall now see
her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan  

 that is   replied mr  knightley   she will indulge her even more
than she did you  and believe that she does not indulge her at all 
it will be the only difference  

 poor child   cried emma   at that rate  what will become of her  

 nothing very bad   the fate of thousands   she will be disagreeable
in infancy  and correct herself as she grows older   i am losing
all my bitterness against spoilt children  my dearest emma 
i  who am owing all my happiness to  you   would not it be horrible
ingratitude in me to be severe on them  

emma laughed  and replied    but i had the assistance of all
your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people 
i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it  

 do you   i have no doubt   nature gave you understanding   
miss taylor gave you principles   you must have done well 
my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good   it was
very natural for you to say  what right has he to lecture me   
and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done
in a disagreeable manner   i do not believe i did you any good 
the good was all to myself  by making you an object of the tenderest
affection to me   i could not think about you so much without doating
on you  faults and all  and by dint of fancying so many errors 
have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least  

 i am sure you were of use to me   cried emma    i was very often
influenced rightly by you  oftener than i would own at the time 
i am very sure you did me good   and if poor little anna weston is
to be spoiled  it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much
for her as you have done for me  except falling in love with her
when she is thirteen  

 how often  when you were a girl  have you said to me  with one
of your saucy looks   mr  knightley  i am going to do so and so 
papa says i may  or i have miss taylor s leave   something which 
you knew  i did not approve   in such cases my interference was giving
you two bad feelings instead of one  

 what an amiable creature i was   no wonder you should hold
my speeches in such affectionate remembrance  

  mr  knightley    you always called me   mr  knightley   and 
from habit  it has not so very formal a sound   and yet it is formal 
i want you to call me something else  but i do not know what  

 i remember once calling you  george   in one of my amiable fits 
about ten years ago   i did it because i thought it would offend you 
but  as you made no objection  i never did it again  

 and cannot you call me  george  now  

 impossible   i never can call you any thing but  mr  knightley  
i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs  elton 
by calling you mr  k   but i will promise   she added presently 
laughing and blushing   i will promise to call you once by your
christian name   i do not say when  but perhaps you may guess
where   in the building in which n  takes m  for better  for worse  

emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one
important service which his better sense would have rendered her 
to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all
her womanly follies  her wilful intimacy with harriet smith 
but it was too tender a subject   she could not enter on it   
harriet was very seldom mentioned between them   this  on his side 
might merely proceed from her not being thought of  but emma
was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy  and a suspicion 
from some appearances  that their friendship were declining 
she was aware herself  that  parting under any other circumstances 
they certainly should have corresponded more  and that her
intelligence would not have rested  as it now almost wholly did 
on isabella s letters   he might observe that it was so   the pain
of being obliged to practise concealment towards him  was very little
inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy 

isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could
be expected  on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits 
which appeared perfectly natural  as there was a dentist to
be consulted  but  since that business had been over  she did not
appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before   
isabella  to be sure  was no very quick observer  yet if harriet
had not been equal to playing with the children  it would not have
escaped her   emma s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on 
by harriet s being to stay longer  her fortnight was likely to be
a month at least   mr  and mrs  john knightley were to come down
in august  and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back 

 john does not even mention your friend   said mr  knightley 
 here is his answer  if you like to see it  

it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage 
emma accepted it with a very eager hand  with an impatience all alive
to know what he would say about it  and not at all checked by hearing
that her friend was unmentioned 

 john enters like a brother into my happiness   continued mr  knightley 
 but he is no complimenter  and though i well know him to have 
likewise  a most brotherly affection for you  he is so far from
making flourishes  that any other young woman might think him rather
cool in her praise   but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes  

 he writes like a sensible man   replied emma  when she had read
the letter    i honour his sincerity   it is very plain that he
considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side 
but that he is not without hope of my growing  in time  as worthy
of your affection  as you think me already   had he said any thing
to bear a different construction  i should not have believed him  

 my emma  he means no such thing   he only means   

 he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two  
interrupted she  with a sort of serious smile   much less  perhaps 
than he is aware of  if we could enter without ceremony or reserve
on the subject  

 emma  my dear emma   

 oh   she cried with more thorough gaiety   if you fancy your
brother does not do me justice  only wait till my dear father is in
the secret  and hear his opinion   depend upon it  he will be much
farther from doing  you  justice   he will think all the happiness 
all the advantage  on your side of the question  all the merit
on mine   i wish i may not sink into  poor emma  with him at once   
his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther  

 ah   he cried   i wish your father might be half as easily convinced
as john will be  of our having every right that equal worth can give 
to be happy together   i am amused by one part of john s letter  
did you notice it   where he says  that my information did not take
him wholly by surprize  that he was rather in expectation of hearing
something of the kind  

 if i understand your brother  he only means so far as your having
some thoughts of marrying   he had no idea of me   he seems perfectly
unprepared for that  

 yes  yes  but i am amused that he should have seen so far into
my feelings   what has he been judging by   i am not conscious
of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare
him at this time for my marrying any more than at another   
but it was so  i suppose   i dare say there was a difference when i
was staying with them the other day   i believe i did not play
with the children quite so much as usual   i remember one evening
the poor boys saying   uncle seems always tired now   

the time was coming when the news must spread farther  and other persons 
reception of it tried   as soon as mrs  weston was sufficiently
recovered to admit mr  woodhouse s visits  emma having it in view
that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause 
resolved first to announce it at home  and then at randalls   
but how to break it to her father at last   she had bound herself
to do it  in such an hour of mr  knightley s absence  or when it
came to the point her heart would have failed her  and she must
have put it off  but mr  knightley was to come at such a time 
and follow up the beginning she was to make   she was forced
to speak  and to speak cheerfully too   she must not make it a more
decided subject of misery to him  by a melancholy tone herself 
she must not appear to think it a misfortune   with all the spirits
she could command  she prepared him first for something strange 
and then  in a few words  said  that if his consent and approbation
could be obtained  which  she trusted  would be attended with
no difficulty  since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all  
she and mr  knightley meant to marry  by which means hartfield
would receive the constant addition of that person s company
whom she knew he loved  next to his daughters and mrs  weston 
best in the world 

poor man   it was at first a considerable shock to him  and he tried
earnestly to dissuade her from it   she was reminded  more than once 
of having always said she would never marry  and assured that it
would be a great deal better for her to remain single  and told of
poor isabella  and poor miss taylor   but it would not do   emma hung
about him affectionately  and smiled  and said it must be so  and that
he must not class her with isabella and mrs  weston  whose marriages
taking them from hartfield  had  indeed  made a melancholy change 
but she was not going from hartfield  she should be always there 
she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but
for the better  and she was very sure that he would be a great deal
the happier for having mr  knightley always at hand  when he were once
got used to the idea   did he not love mr  knightley very much   
he would not deny that he did  she was sure   whom did he ever want
to consult on business but mr  knightley   who was so useful to him 
who so ready to write his letters  who so glad to assist him   
who so cheerful  so attentive  so attached to him   would not he
like to have him always on the spot   yes   that was all very true 
mr  knightley could not be there too often  he should be glad to see
him every day   but they did see him every day as it was   why could
not they go on as they had done 

mr  woodhouse could not be soon reconciled  but the worst was overcome 
the idea was given  time and continual repetition must do the rest   
to emma s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr  knightley s 
whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome 
and he was soon used to be talked to by each  on every fair occasion   
they had all the assistance which isabella could give  by letters
of the strongest approbation  and mrs  weston was ready 
on the first meeting  to consider the subject in the most
serviceable light  first  as a settled  and  secondly  as a good one  
well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations
to mr  woodhouse s mind   it was agreed upon  as what was to be 
and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that
it would be for his happiness  and having some feelings himself
which almost admitted it  he began to think that some time or other  
in another year or two  perhaps  it might not be so very bad
if the marriage did take place 

mrs  weston was acting no part  feigning no feelings in all that she
said to him in favour of the event   she had been extremely surprized 
never more so  than when emma first opened the affair to her 
but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all  and had
no scruple in urging him to the utmost   she had such a regard
for mr  knightley  as to think he deserved even her dearest emma 
and it was in every respect so proper  suitable  and unexceptionable
a connexion  and in one respect  one point of the highest importance 
so peculiarly eligible  so singularly fortunate  that now it seemed
as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature 
and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having
thought of it  and wished it long ago   how very few of those men
in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own
home for hartfield   and who but mr  knightley could know and bear
with mr  woodhouse  so as to make such an arrangement desirable   
the difficulty of disposing of poor mr  woodhouse had been always
felt in her husband s plans and her own  for a marriage between frank
and emma   how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had
been a continual impediment  less acknowledged by mr  weston than
by herself  but even he had never been able to finish the subject
better than by saying   those matters will take care of themselves 
the young people will find a way    but here there was nothing to be
shifted off in a wild speculation on the future   it was all right 
all open  all equal   no sacrifice on any side worth the name 
it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself 
and without one real  rational difficulty to oppose or delay it 

mrs  weston  with her baby on her knee  indulging in such reflections
as these  was one of the happiest women in the world   if any thing
could increase her delight  it was perceiving that the baby would
soon have outgrown its first set of caps 

the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread 
and mr  weston had his five minutes share of it  but five minutes
were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind   
he saw the advantages of the match  and rejoiced in them with all
the constancy of his wife  but the wonder of it was very soon nothing 
and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he
had always foreseen it 

 it is to be a secret  i conclude   said he    these matters are
always a secret  till it is found out that every body knows them 
only let me be told when i may speak out   i wonder whether jane has
any suspicion  

he went to highbury the next morning  and satisfied himself on
that point   he told her the news   was not she like a daughter 
his eldest daughter   he must tell her  and miss bates being present 
it passed  of course  to mrs  cole  mrs  perry  and mrs  elton 
immediately afterwards   it was no more than the principals were
prepared for  they had calculated from the time of its being known
at randalls  how soon it would be over highbury  and were thinking
of themselves  as the evening wonder in many a family circle 
with great sagacity 

in general  it was a very well approved match   some might think him 
and others might think her  the most in luck   one set might
recommend their all removing to donwell  and leaving hartfield
for the john knightleys  and another might predict disagreements
among their servants  but yet  upon the whole  there was no serious
objection raised  except in one habitation  the vicarage   there 
the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction   mr  elton
cared little about it  compared with his wife  he only hoped  the
young lady s pride would now be contented   and supposed  she had
always meant to catch knightley if she could   and  on the point
of living at hartfield  could daringly exclaim   rather he than i    
but mrs  elton was very much discomposed indeed    poor knightley 
poor fellow   sad business for him   she was extremely concerned 
for  though very eccentric  he had a thousand good qualities   
how could he be so taken in   did not think him at all in love  
not in the least   poor knightley   there would be an end of all
pleasant intercourse with him   how happy he had been to come and dine
with them whenever they asked him   but that would be all over now   
poor fellow   no more exploring parties to donwell made for  her  
oh  no  there would be a mrs  knightley to throw cold water on
every thing   extremely disagreeable   but she was not at all sorry
that she had abused the housekeeper the other day   shocking plan 
living together   it would never do   she knew a family near maple
grove who had tried it  and been obliged to separate before the end
of the first quarter 



chapter xviii


time passed on   a few more to morrows  and the party from london
would be arriving   it was an alarming change  and emma was thinking
of it one morning  as what must bring a great deal to agitate and
grieve her  when mr  knightley came in  and distressing thoughts
were put by   after the first chat of pleasure he was silent 
and then  in a graver tone  began with 

 i have something to tell you  emma  some news  

 good or bad   said she  quickly  looking up in his face 

 i do not know which it ought to be called  

 oh  good i am sure   i see it in your countenance   you are trying
not to smile  

 i am afraid   said he  composing his features   i am very much afraid 
my dear emma  that you will not smile when you hear it  

 indeed  but why so   i can hardly imagine that any thing which
pleases or amuses you  should not please and amuse me too  

 there is one subject   he replied   i hope but one  on which
we do not think alike    he paused a moment  again smiling 
with his eyes fixed on her face    does nothing occur to you   
do not you recollect   harriet smith  

her cheeks flushed at the name  and she felt afraid of something 
though she knew not what 

 have you heard from her yourself this morning   cried he 
 you have  i believe  and know the whole  

 no  i have not  i know nothing  pray tell me  

 you are prepared for the worst  i see  and very bad it is 
harriet smith marries robert martin  

emma gave a start  which did not seem like being prepared  
and her eyes  in eager gaze  said   no  this is impossible  
but her lips were closed 

 it is so  indeed   continued mr  knightley   i have it from robert
martin himself   he left me not half an hour ago  

she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement 

 you like it  my emma  as little as i feared   i wish our opinions were
the same   but in time they will   time  you may be sure  will make
one or the other of us think differently  and  in the meanwhile 
we need not talk much on the subject  

 you mistake me  you quite mistake me   she replied  exerting herself 
 it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy 
but i cannot believe it   it seems an impossibility   you cannot mean
to say  that harriet smith has accepted robert martin   you cannot
mean that he has even proposed to her again  yet   you only mean 
that he intends it  

 i mean that he has done it   answered mr  knightley  with smiling
but determined decision   and been accepted  

 good god   she cried    well    then having recourse to her workbasket 
in excuse for leaning down her face  and concealing all the
exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she
must be expressing  she added   well  now tell me every thing 
make this intelligible to me   how  where  when   let me know it all 
i never was more surprized  but it does not make me unhappy 
i assure you   how  how has it been possible  

 it is a very simple story   he went to town on business three days ago 
and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting
to send to john   he delivered these papers to john  at his chambers 
and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s 
they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s  the party
was to be our brother and sister  henry  john  and miss smith 
my friend robert could not resist   they called for him in their way 
were all extremely amused  and my brother asked him to dine with
them the next day  which he did  and in the course of that visit
 as i understand  he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet 
and certainly did not speak in vain   she made him  by her acceptance 
as happy even as he is deserving   he came down by yesterday s coach 
and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast  to report
his proceedings  first on my affairs  and then on his own 
this is all that i can relate of the how  where  and when 
your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her   
she will give you all the minute particulars  which only woman s
language can make interesting   in our communications we deal only
in the great   however  i must say  that robert martin s heart seemed
for  him   and to  me   very overflowing  and that he did mention 
without its being much to the purpose  that on quitting their
box at astley s  my brother took charge of mrs  john knightley
and little john  and he followed with miss smith and henry 
and that at one time they were in such a crowd  as to make miss smith
rather uneasy  

he stopped   emma dared not attempt any immediate reply   to speak 
she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree
of happiness   she must wait a moment  or he would think her mad 
her silence disturbed him  and after observing her a little while 
he added 

 emma  my love  you said that this circumstance would not now make
you unhappy  but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected 
his situation is an evil  but you must consider it as what satisfies
your friend  and i will answer for your thinking better and better
of him as you know him more   his good sense and good principles would
delight you   as far as the man is concerned  you could not wish your
friend in better hands   his rank in society i would alter if i could 
which is saying a great deal i assure you  emma   you laugh at me
about william larkins  but i could quite as ill spare robert martin  

he wanted her to look up and smile  and having now brought herself
not to smile too broadly  she did  cheerfully answering 

 you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match   i think
harriet is doing extremely well    her  connexions may be worse than  his  
in respectability of character  there can be no doubt that they are 
i have been silent from surprize merely  excessive surprize 
you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me  how peculiarly
unprepared i was   for i had reason to believe her very lately more
determined against him  much more  than she was before  

 you ought to know your friend best   replied mr  knightley 
 but i should say she was a good tempered  soft hearted girl 
not likely to be very  very determined against any young man who told
her he loved her  

emma could not help laughing as she answered   upon my word 
i believe you know her quite as well as i do   but  mr  knightley 
are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright
 accepted  him   i could suppose she might in time  but can she already   
did not you misunderstand him   you were both talking of other things 
of business  shows of cattle  or new drills  and might not you 
in the confusion of so many subjects  mistake him   it was not
harriet s hand that he was certain of  it was the dimensions of some
famous ox  

the contrast between the countenance and air of mr  knightley and
robert martin was  at this moment  so strong to emma s feelings 
and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently
passed on harriet s side  so fresh the sound of those words 
spoken with such emphasis   no  i hope i know better than to think
of robert martin   that she was really expecting the intelligence
to prove  in some measure  premature   it could not be otherwise 

 do you dare say this   cried mr  knightley    do you dare to suppose
me so great a blockhead  as not to know what a man is talking of   
what do you deserve  

 oh   i always deserve the best treatment  because i never put
up with any other  and  therefore  you must give me a plain 
direct answer   are you quite sure that you understand the terms
on which mr  martin and harriet now are  

 i am quite sure   he replied  speaking very distinctly   that he
told me she had accepted him  and that there was no obscurity 
nothing doubtful  in the words he used  and i think i can give you
a proof that it must be so   he asked my opinion as to what he
was now to do   he knew of no one but mrs  goddard to whom he
could apply for information of her relations or friends   could i
mention any thing more fit to be done  than to go to mrs  goddard 
i assured him that i could not   then  he said  he would endeavour
to see her in the course of this day  

 i am perfectly satisfied   replied emma  with the brightest smiles 
 and most sincerely wish them happy  

 you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before  

 i hope so  for at that time i was a fool  

 and i am changed also  for i am now very willing to grant you all
harriet s good qualities   i have taken some pains for your sake 
and for robert martin s sake   whom i have always had reason to believe
as much in love with her as ever   to get acquainted with her 
i have often talked to her a good deal   you must have seen that
i did   sometimes  indeed  i have thought you were half suspecting me
of pleading poor martin s cause  which was never the case  but  from all
my observations  i am convinced of her being an artless  amiable girl 
with very good notions  very seriously good principles  and placing
her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life   
much of this  i have no doubt  she may thank you for  

 me   cried emma  shaking her head    ah  poor harriet  

she checked herself  however  and submitted quietly to a little
more praise than she deserved 

their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of
her father   she was not sorry   she wanted to be alone   her mind
was in a state of flutter and wonder  which made it impossible for her
to be collected   she was in dancing  singing  exclaiming spirits 
and till she had moved about  and talked to herself  and laughed
and reflected  she could be fit for nothing rational 

her father s business was to announce james s being gone out to put
the horses to  preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls 
and she had  therefore  an immediate excuse for disappearing 

the joy  the gratitude  the exquisite delight of her sensations
may be imagined   the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the
prospect of harriet s welfare  she was really in danger of becoming
too happy for security   what had she to wish for   nothing  but to
grow more worthy of him  whose intentions and judgment had been
ever so superior to her own   nothing  but that the lessons
of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future 

serious she was  very serious in her thankfulness  and in her resolutions 
and yet there was no preventing a laugh  sometimes in the very midst
of them   she must laugh at such a close   such an end of the doleful
disappointment of five weeks back   such a heart  such a harriet 

now there would be pleasure in her returning  every thing would
be a pleasure   it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin 

high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities 
was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from
mr  knightley would soon be over   the disguise  equivocation 
mystery  so hateful to her to practise  might soon be over 
she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect
confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty 

in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father 
not always listening  but always agreeing to what he said 
and  whether in speech or silence  conniving at the comfortable
persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day 
or poor mrs  weston would be disappointed 

they arrived   mrs  weston was alone in the drawing room   
but hardly had they been told of the baby  and mr  woodhouse
received the thanks for coming  which he asked for  when a glimpse
was caught through the blind  of two figures passing near the window 

 it is frank and miss fairfax   said mrs  weston    i was just
going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive
this morning   he stays till to morrow  and miss fairfax has been
persuaded to spend the day with us   they are coming in  i hope  

in half a minute they were in the room   emma was extremely glad
to see him  but there was a degree of confusion  a number of
embarrassing recollections on each side   they met readily and smiling 
but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said 
and having all sat down again  there was for some time such a blank
in the circle  that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged 
which she had long felt  of seeing frank churchill once more 
and of seeing him with jane  would yield its proportion of pleasure 
when mr  weston joined the party  however  and when the baby
was fetched  there was no longer a want of subject or animation  
or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her
and say 

 i have to thank you  miss woodhouse  for a very kind forgiving
message in one of mrs  weston s letters   i hope time has not made
you less willing to pardon   i hope you do not retract what you
then said  

 no  indeed   cried emma  most happy to begin   not in the least 
i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you  and to give
you joy in person  

he thanked her with all his heart  and continued some time to speak
with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness 

 is not she looking well   said he  turning his eyes towards jane 
 better than she ever used to do   you see how my father and
mrs  weston doat upon her  

but his spirits were soon rising again  and with laughing eyes 
after mentioning the expected return of the campbells  he named
the name of dixon   emma blushed  and forbade its being pronounced
in her hearing 

 i can never think of it   she cried   without extreme shame  

 the shame   he answered   is all mine  or ought to be   but is it
possible that you had no suspicion   i mean of late   early  i know 
you had none  

 i never had the smallest  i assure you  

 that appears quite wonderful   i was once very near  and i wish i had  
it would have been better   but though i was always doing wrong things 
they were very bad wrong things  and such as did me no service   
it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond
of secrecy and told you every thing  

 it is not now worth a regret   said emma 

 i have some hope   resumed he   of my uncle s being persuaded
to pay a visit at randalls  he wants to be introduced to her 
when the campbells are returned  we shall meet them in london 
and continue there  i trust  till we may carry her northward   but now 
i am at such a distance from her  is not it hard  miss woodhouse   
till this morning  we have not once met since the day of reconciliation 
do not you pity me  

emma spoke her pity so very kindly  that with a sudden accession
of gay thought  he cried 

 ah  by the bye   then sinking his voice  and looking demure for
the moment   i hope mr  knightley is well    he paused   she coloured
and laughed    i know you saw my letter  and think you may remember
my wish in your favour   let me return your congratulations   
i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest
and satisfaction   he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise  

emma was delighted  and only wanted him to go on in the same style 
but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his
own jane  and his next words were 

 did you ever see such a skin   such smoothness  such delicacy   
and yet without being actually fair   one cannot call her fair 
it is a most uncommon complexion  with her dark eye lashes and hair  
a most distinguishing complexion   so peculiarly the lady in it   
just colour enough for beauty  

 i have always admired her complexion   replied emma  archly   but do not
i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale   
when we first began to talk of her   have you quite forgotten  

 oh  no  what an impudent dog i was   how could i dare   

but he laughed so heartily at the recollection  that emma could
not help saying 

 i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time 
you had very great amusement in tricking us all   i am sure you had   
i am sure it was a consolation to you  

 oh  no  no  no  how can you suspect me of such a thing 
i was the most miserable wretch  

 not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth   i am sure it
was a source of high entertainment to you  to feel that you were taking
us all in   perhaps i am the readier to suspect  because  to tell
you the truth  i think it might have been some amusement to myself
in the same situation   i think there is a little likeness between us  

he bowed 

 if not in our dispositions   she presently added  with a look of
true sensibility   there is a likeness in our destiny  the destiny
which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior
to our own  

 true  true   he answered  warmly    no  not true on your side   you can
have no superior  but most true on mine   she is a complete angel 
look at her   is not she an angel in every gesture   observe the turn
of her throat   observe her eyes  as she is looking up at my father   
you will be glad to hear  inclining his head  and whispering seriously 
that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels   they are to be
new set   i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head 
will not it be beautiful in her dark hair  

 very beautiful  indeed   replied emma  and she spoke so kindly 
that he gratefully burst out 

 how delighted i am to see you again  and to see you in such
excellent looks   i would not have missed this meeting for the world 
i should certainly have called at hartfield  had you failed to come  

the others had been talking of the child  mrs  weston giving an
account of a little alarm she had been under  the evening before 
from the infant s appearing not quite well   she believed she had
been foolish  but it had alarmed her  and she had been within half
a minute of sending for mr  perry   perhaps she ought to be ashamed 
but mr  weston had been almost as uneasy as herself   in ten minutes 
however  the child had been perfectly well again   this was
her history  and particularly interesting it was to mr  woodhouse 
who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry 
and only regretted that she had not done it    she should always send
for perry  if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered 
were it only for a moment   she could not be too soon alarmed 
nor send for perry too often   it was a pity  perhaps  that he
had not come last night  for  though the child seemed well now 
very well considering  it would probably have been better if perry
had seen it  

frank churchill caught the name 

 perry   said he to emma  and trying  as he spoke  to catch miss
fairfax s eye    my friend mr  perry   what are they saying
about mr  perry   has he been here this morning   and how does
he travel now   has he set up his carriage  

emma soon recollected  and understood him  and while she joined
in the laugh  it was evident from jane s countenance that she
too was really hearing him  though trying to seem deaf 

 such an extraordinary dream of mine   he cried    i can never think
of it without laughing   she hears us  she hears us  miss woodhouse 
i see it in her cheek  her smile  her vain attempt to frown 
look at her   do not you see that  at this instant  the very passage
of her own letter  which sent me the report  is passing under her eye  
that the whole blunder is spread before her  that she can attend to
nothing else  though pretending to listen to the others  

jane was forced to smile completely  for a moment  and the smile
partly remained as she turned towards him  and said in a conscious 
low  yet steady voice 

 how you can bear such recollections  is astonishing to me   
they  will  sometimes obtrude  but how you can court them  

he had a great deal to say in return  and very entertainingly 
but emma s feelings were chiefly with jane  in the argument  and on
leaving randalls  and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men 
she felt  that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill 
and really regarding him as she did with friendship  she had never
been more sensible of mr  knightley s high superiority of character 
the happiness of this most happy day  received its completion  in the
animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced 



chapter xix


if emma had still  at intervals  an anxious feeling for harriet 
a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured
of her attachment to mr  knightley  and really able to accept
another man from unbiased inclination  it was not long that she
had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty 
a very few days brought the party from london  and she had no
sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet 
than she became perfectly satisfied  unaccountable as it was   
that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr  knightley 
and was now forming all her views of happiness 

harriet was a little distressed  did look a little foolish at first 
but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly 
and self deceived  before  her pain and confusion seemed to die
away with the words  and leave her without a care for the past 
and with the fullest exultation in the present and future  for  as to
her friend s approbation  emma had instantly removed every fear of
that nature  by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations   
harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at
astley s  and the dinner the next day  she could dwell on it all
with the utmost delight   but what did such particulars explain   
the fact was  as emma could now acknowledge  that harriet had
always liked robert martin  and that his continuing to love her had
been irresistible   beyond this  it must ever be unintelligible
to emma 

the event  however  was most joyful  and every day was giving her
fresh reason for thinking so   harriet s parentage became known 
she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman  rich enough to afford
her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers  and decent
enough to have always wished for concealment   such was the blood
of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for   
it was likely to be as untainted  perhaps  as the blood of many
a gentleman   but what a connexion had she been preparing for
mr  knightley  or for the churchills  or even for mr  elton   
the stain of illegitimacy  unbleached by nobility or wealth 
would have been a stain indeed 

no objection was raised on the father s side  the young man was
treated liberally  it was all as it should be   and as emma became
acquainted with robert martin  who was now introduced at hartfield 
she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth
which could bid fairest for her little friend   she had no doubt
of harriet s happiness with any good tempered man  but with him 
and in the home he offered  there would be the hope of more 
of security  stability  and improvement   she would be placed in the
midst of those who loved her  and who had better sense than herself 
retired enough for safety  and occupied enough for cheerfulness 
she would be never led into temptation  nor left for it to find her out 
she would be respectable and happy  and emma admitted her to be
the luckiest creature in the world  to have created so steady and
persevering an affection in such a man   or  if not quite the luckiest 
to yield only to herself 

harriet  necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins 
was less and less at hartfield  which was not to be regretted   
the intimacy between her and emma must sink  their friendship must
change into a calmer sort of goodwill  and  fortunately  what ought
to be  and must be  seemed already beginning  and in the most gradual 
natural manner 

before the end of september  emma attended harriet to church  and saw
her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction 
as no remembrances  even connected with mr  elton as he stood
before them  could impair   perhaps  indeed  at that time she
scarcely saw mr  elton  but as the clergyman whose blessing at the
altar might next fall on herself   robert martin and harriet smith 
the latest couple engaged of the three  were the first to be married 

jane fairfax had already quitted highbury  and was restored to the
comforts of her beloved home with the campbells   the mr  churchills
were also in town  and they were only waiting for november 

the intermediate month was the one fixed on  as far as they dared 
by emma and mr  knightley   they had determined that their marriage
ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield 
to allow them the fortnight s absence in a tour to the seaside 
which was the plan   john and isabella  and every other friend 
were agreed in approving it   but mr  woodhouse  how was mr  woodhouse
to be induced to consent   he  who had never yet alluded to their
marriage but as a distant event 

when first sounded on the subject  he was so miserable  that they
were almost hopeless   a second allusion  indeed  gave less pain   
he began to think it was to be  and that he could not prevent it  
a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation 
still  however  he was not happy   nay  he appeared so much otherwise 
that his daughter s courage failed   she could not bear to see
him suffering  to know him fancying himself neglected  and though
her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the
mr  knightleys  that when once the event were over  his distress
would be soon over too  she hesitated  she could not proceed 

in this state of suspense they were befriended  not by any sudden
illumination of mr  woodhouse s mind  or any wonderful change of his
nervous system  but by the operation of the same system in another way   
mrs  weston s poultry house was robbed one night of all her turkeys  
evidently by the ingenuity of man   other poultry yards in the
neighbourhood also suffered   pilfering was  housebreaking  to
mr  woodhouse s fears   he was very uneasy  and but for the sense
of his son in law s protection  would have been under wretched alarm
every night of his life   the strength  resolution  and presence
of mind of the mr  knightleys  commanded his fullest dependence 
while either of them protected him and his  hartfield was safe   
but mr  john knightley must be in london again by the end of the
first week in november 

the result of this distress was  that  with a much more voluntary 
cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at
the moment  she was able to fix her wedding day  and mr  elton was
called on  within a month from the marriage of mr  and mrs  robert
martin  to join the hands of mr  knightley and miss woodhouse 

the wedding was very much like other weddings  where the parties
have no taste for finery or parade  and mrs  elton  from the
particulars detailed by her husband  thought it all extremely shabby 
and very inferior to her own    very little white satin  very few
lace veils  a most pitiful business   selina would stare when she
heard of it    but  in spite of these deficiencies  the wishes 
the hopes  the confidence  the predictions of the small band
of true friends who witnessed the ceremony  were fully answered
in the perfect happiness of the union 


finis
 persuasion by jane austen 1818 


chapter 1


sir walter elliot  of kellynch hall  in somersetshire  was a man who 
for his own amusement  never took up any book but the baronetage 
there he found occupation for an idle hour  and consolation in a
distressed one  there his faculties were roused into admiration and
respect  by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents 
there any unwelcome sensations  arising from domestic affairs
changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over
the almost endless creations of the last century  and there 
if every other leaf were powerless  he could read his own history
with an interest which never failed   this was the page at which
the favourite volume always opened 

            elliot of kellynch hall 

 walter elliot  born march 1  1760  married  july 15  1784  elizabeth 
daughter of james stevenson  esq  of south park  in the county of
gloucester  by which lady  who died 1800  he has issue elizabeth 
born june 1  1785  anne  born august 9  1787  a still born son 
november 5  1789  mary  born november 20  1791  

precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer s hands 
but sir walter had improved it by adding  for the information of
himself and his family  these words  after the date of mary s birth  
 married  december 16  1810  charles  son and heir of charles
musgrove  esq  of uppercross  in the county of somerset  
and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which
he had lost his wife 

then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family 
in the usual terms  how it had been first settled in cheshire 
how mentioned in dugdale  serving the office of high sheriff 
representing a borough in three successive parliaments 
exertions of loyalty  and dignity of baronet  in the first year
of charles ii  with all the marys and elizabeths they had married 
forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages  and concluding with
the arms and motto    principal seat  kellynch hall  in the county
of somerset   and sir walter s handwriting again in this finale   

 heir presumptive  william walter elliot  esq   great grandson of
the second sir walter  

vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot s character 
vanity of person and of situation   he had been remarkably handsome
in his youth  and  at fifty four  was still a very fine man 
few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did 
nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with
the place he held in society   he considered the blessing of beauty
as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy  and the sir walter elliot 
who united these gifts  was the constant object of his warmest respect
and devotion 

his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment 
since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character
to any thing deserved by his own   lady elliot had been an excellent woman 
sensible and amiable  whose judgement and conduct  if they might be
pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot 
had never required indulgence afterwards   she had humoured 
or softened  or concealed his failings  and promoted his real
respectability for seventeen years  and though not the very happiest
being in the world herself  had found enough in her duties  her friends 
and her children  to attach her to life  and make it no matter of
indifference to her when she was called on to quit them 
  three girls  the two eldest sixteen and fourteen  was an awful legacy
for a mother to bequeath  an awful charge rather  to confide to
the authority and guidance of a conceited  silly father 
she had  however  one very intimate friend  a sensible  deserving woman 
who had been brought  by strong attachment to herself  to settle
close by her  in the village of kellynch  and on her kindness and advice 
lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of
the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously
giving her daughters 

this friend  and sir walter  did not marry  whatever might have been
anticipated on that head by their acquaintance   thirteen years
had passed away since lady elliot s death  and they were still
near neighbours and intimate friends  and one remained a widower 
the other a widow 

that lady russell  of steady age and character  and extremely
well provided for  should have no thought of a second marriage 
needs no apology to the public  which is rather apt to be unreasonably
discontented when a woman does marry again  than when she does not 
but sir walter s continuing in singleness requires explanation 
be it known then  that sir walter  like a good father   having met with
one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications  
prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters  sake 
for one daughter  his eldest  he would really have given up any thing 
which he had not been very much tempted to do   elizabeth had succeeded 
at sixteen  to all that was possible  of her mother s rights
and consequence  and being very handsome  and very like himself 
her influence had always been great  and they had gone on together
most happily   his two other children were of very inferior value 
mary had acquired a little artificial importance  by becoming
mrs charles musgrove  but anne  with an elegance of mind and sweetness
of character  which must have placed her high with any people
of real understanding  was nobody with either father or sister 
her word had no weight  her convenience was always to give way  
she was only anne 

to lady russell  indeed  she was a most dear and highly valued
god daughter  favourite  and friend   lady russell loved them all 
but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again 

a few years before  anne elliot had been a very pretty girl 
but her bloom had vanished early  and as even in its height 
her father had found little to admire in her   so totally different
were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own  
there could be nothing in them  now that she was faded and thin 
to excite his esteem  he had never indulged much hope  he had now none 
of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work 
all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth  for mary had merely
connected herself with an old country family of respectability and
large fortune  and had therefore given all the honour and received none 
elizabeth would  one day or other  marry suitably 

it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than
she was ten years before  and  generally speaking  if there has been
neither ill health nor anxiety  it is a time of life at which scarcely any
charm is lost   it was so with elizabeth  still the same handsome
miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago  and sir walter
might be excused  therefore  in forgetting her age  or  at least 
be deemed only half a fool  for thinking himself and elizabeth
as blooming as ever  amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else 
for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and
acquaintance were growing   anne haggard  mary coarse  every face
in the neighbourhood worsting  and the rapid increase of the crow s foot
about lady russell s temples had long been a distress to him 

elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment 
thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall  presiding and
directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given
the idea of her being younger than she was   for thirteen years had
she been doing the honours  and laying down the domestic law at home 
and leading the way to the chaise and four  and walking immediately after
lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country 
thirteen winters  revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball
of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded  and thirteen springs
shewn their blossoms  as she travelled up to london with her father 
for a few weeks  annual enjoyment of the great world   she had
the remembrance of all this  she had the consciousness of being
nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions 
she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever 
but she felt her approach to the years of danger  and would have rejoiced
to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within
the next twelvemonth or two   then might she again take up
the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth 
but now she liked it not   always to be presented with the date of
her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister 
made the book an evil  and more than once  when her father had left it
open on the table near her  had she closed it  with averted eyes 
and pushed it away 

she had had a disappointment  moreover  which that book 
and especially the history of her own family  must ever present
the remembrance of   the heir presumptive  the very william walter
elliot  esq   whose rights had been so generously supported
by her father  had disappointed her 

she had  while a very young girl  as soon as she had known him to be 
in the event of her having no brother  the future baronet 
meant to marry him  and her father had always meant that she should 
he had not been known to them as a boy  but soon after lady elliot s death 
sir walter had sought the acquaintance  and though his overtures
had not been met with any warmth  he had persevered in seeking it 
making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth  and  in one of
their spring excursions to london  when elizabeth was in her first bloom 
mr elliot had been forced into the introduction 

he was at that time a very young man  just engaged in the study of the law 
and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable  and every plan in his favour
was confirmed   he was invited to kellynch hall  he was talked of
and expected all the rest of the year  but he never came 
the following spring he was seen again in town  found equally agreeable 
again encouraged  invited  and expected  and again he did not come 
and the next tidings were that he was married   instead of pushing
his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot 
he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman
of inferior birth 

sir walter has resented it   as the head of the house  he felt that
he ought to have been consulted  especially after taking the young man
so publicly by the hand   for they must have been seen together  
he observed   once at tattersall s  and twice in the lobby of
the house of commons    his disapprobation was expressed 
but apparently very little regarded   mr elliot had attempted no apology 
and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family 
as sir walter considered him unworthy of it   all acquaintance between
them had ceased 

this very awkward history of mr elliot was still  after an interval
of several years  felt with anger by elizabeth  who had liked the man
for himself  and still more for being her father s heir  and whose
strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter
elliot s eldest daughter   there was not a baronet from a to z whom
her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal 
yet so miserably had he conducted himself  that though she was
at this present time  the summer of 1814  wearing black ribbons
for his wife  she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again 
the disgrace of his first marriage might  perhaps  as there was
no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring  have been got over 
had he not done worse  but he had  as by the accustomary intervention
of kind friends  they had been informed  spoken most disrespectfully
of them all  most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood
he belonged to  and the honours which were hereafter to be his own 
this could not be pardoned 

such were elizabeth elliot s sentiments and sensations  such the cares
to alloy  the agitations to vary  the sameness and the elegance 
the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life 
such the feelings to give interest to a long  uneventful residence
in one country circle  to fill the vacancies which there were no habits
of utility abroad  no talents or accomplishments for home  to occupy 

but now  another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be
added to these   her father was growing distressed for money 
she knew  that when he now took up the baronetage  it was to drive
the heavy bills of his tradespeople  and the unwelcome hints of
mr shepherd  his agent  from his thoughts   the kellynch property was good 
but not equal to sir walter s apprehension of the state required
in its possessor   while lady elliot lived  there had been method 
moderation  and economy  which had just kept him within his income 
but with her had died all such right mindedness  and from that period
he had been constantly exceeding it   it had not been possible
for him to spend less  he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot
was imperiously called on to do  but blameless as he was  he was
not only growing dreadfully in debt  but was hearing of it so often 
that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer  even partially 
from his daughter   he had given her some hints of it the last spring
in town  he had gone so far even as to say   can we retrench 
does it occur to you that there is any one article in which
we can retrench   and elizabeth  to do her justice  had  in the first
ardour of female alarm  set seriously to think what could be done 
and had finally proposed these two branches of economy  to cut off
some unnecessary charities  and to refrain from new furnishing
the drawing room  to which expedients she afterwards added
the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne 
as had been the usual yearly custom   but these measures 
however good in themselves  were insufficient for the real extent
of the evil  the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged
to confess to her soon afterwards   elizabeth had nothing to propose
of deeper efficacy   she felt herself ill used and unfortunate 
as did her father  and they were neither of them able to devise
any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity 
or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne 

there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of 
but had every acre been alienable  it would have made no difference 
he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power 
but he would never condescend to sell   no  he would never disgrace
his name so far   the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole
and entire  as he had received it 

their two confidential friends  mr shepherd  who lived in
the neighbouring market town  and lady russell  were called to advise them 
and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be
struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments
and reduce their expenditure  without involving the loss of
any indulgence of taste or pride 



chapter 2


mr shepherd  a civil  cautious lawyer  who  whatever might be his hold
or his views on sir walter  would rather have the disagreeable
prompted by anybody else  excused himself from offering the slightest hint 
and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to
the excellent judgement of lady russell  from whose known good sense
he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as
he meant to see finally adopted 

lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject  and gave it
much serious consideration   she was a woman rather of sound than of
quick abilities  whose difficulties in coming to any decision
in this instance were great  from the opposition of two leading principles 
she was of strict integrity herself  with a delicate sense of honour 
but she was as desirous of saving sir walter s feelings  as solicitous
for the credit of the family  as aristocratic in her ideas of what
was due to them  as anybody of sense and honesty could well be 
she was a benevolent  charitable  good woman  and capable of
strong attachments  most correct in her conduct  strict in her notions
of decorum  and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding 
she had a cultivated mind  and was  generally speaking 
rational and consistent  but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry 
she had a value for rank and consequence  which blinded her a little
to the faults of those who possessed them   herself the widow of
only a knight  she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due 
and sir walter  independent of his claims as an old acquaintance 
an attentive neighbour  an obliging landlord  the husband of her
very dear friend  the father of anne and her sisters  was 
as being sir walter  in her apprehension  entitled to a great deal
of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties 

they must retrench  that did not admit of a doubt   but she was
very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him
and elizabeth  she drew up plans of economy  she made exact calculations 
and she did what nobody else thought of doing   she consulted anne 
who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest
in the question  she consulted  and in a degree was influenced by her
in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted
to sir walter  every emendation of anne s had been on the side of
honesty against importance   she wanted more vigorous measures 
a more complete reformation  a quicker release from debt 
a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity 

 if we can persuade your father to all this   said lady russell 
looking over her paper   much may be done   if he will adopt
these regulations  in seven years he will be clear  and i hope
we may be able to convince him and elizabeth  that kellynch hall has
a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions 
and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from
lessened in the eyes of sensible people  by acting like a man of principle 
what will he be doing  in fact  but what very many of our first families
have done  or ought to do   there will be nothing singular in his case 
and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering 
as it always does of our conduct   i have great hope of prevailing 
we must be serious and decided  for after all  the person who
has contracted debts must pay them  and though a great deal is due to
the feelings of the gentleman  and the head of a house  like your father 
there is still more due to the character of an honest man  

this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding 
his friends to be urging him   she considered it as an act
of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with
all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments
could secure  and saw no dignity in anything short of it 
she wanted it to be prescribed  and felt as a duty   she rated
lady russell s influence highly  and as to the severe degree
of self denial which her own conscience prompted  she believed
there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete 
than to half a reformation   her knowledge of her father
and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair
of horses would be hardly less painful than of both  and so on 
through the whole list of lady russell s too gentle reductions 

how anne s more rigid requisitions might have been taken
is of little consequence   lady russell s had no success at all 
could not be put up with  were not to be borne   what  every comfort
of life knocked off   journeys  london  servants  horses  table  
contractions and restrictions every where   to live no longer
with the decencies even of a private gentleman   no  he would sooner
quit kellynch hall at once  than remain in it on such disgraceful terms  

 quit kellynch hall    the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd 
whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter s retrenching 
and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without
a change of abode    since the idea had been started in the very quarter
which ought to dictate  he had no scruple   he said   in confessing
his judgement to be entirely on that side   it did not appear to him
that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house
which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support 
in any other place sir walter might judge for himself  and would
be looked up to  as regulating the modes of life in whatever way
he might choose to model his household  

sir walter would quit kellynch hall  and after a very few days more
of doubt and indecision  the great question of whither he should go
was settled  and the first outline of this important change made out 

there had been three alternatives  london  bath  or another house
in the country   all anne s wishes had been for the latter 
a small house in their own neighbourhood  where they might still have
lady russell s society  still be near mary  and still have the pleasure
of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch  was the object
of her ambition   but the usual fate of anne attended her 
in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on 
she disliked bath  and did not think it agreed with her 
and bath was to be her home 

sir walter had at first thought more of london  but mr shepherd felt
that he could not be trusted in london  and had been skilful enough
to dissuade him from it  and make bath preferred   it was a much safer
place for a gentleman in his predicament   he might there be important
at comparatively little expense   two material advantages of bath
over london had of course been given all their weight   its more convenient
distance from kellynch  only fifty miles  and lady russell s spending
some part of every winter there  and to the very great satisfaction
of lady russell  whose first views on the projected change had been
for bath  sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that
they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there 

lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne s known wishes 
it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house
in his own neighbourhood   anne herself would have found
the mortifications of it more than she foresaw  and to sir walter s
feelings they must have been dreadful   and with regard to anne s
dislike of bath  she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising 
first  from the circumstance of her having been three years
at school there  after her mother s death  and secondly 
from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter
which she had afterwards spent there with herself 

lady russell was fond of bath  in short  and disposed to think
it must suit them all  and as to her young friend s health 
by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge 
every danger would be avoided  and it was in fact  a change which must
do both health and spirits good   anne had been too little from home 
too little seen  her spirits were not high   a larger society
would improve them   she wanted her to be more known 

the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood
for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part 
and a very material part of the scheme  which had been happily
engrafted on the beginning   he was not only to quit his home 
but to see it in the hands of others  a trial of fortitude 
which stronger heads than sir walter s have found too much 
kellynch hall was to be let   this  however  was a profound secret 
not to be breathed beyond their own circle 

sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known
to design letting his house   mr shepherd had once mentioned the word
 advertise   but never dared approach it again   sir walter spurned
the idea of its being offered in any manner  forbad the slightest hint
being dropped of his having such an intention  and it was only on
the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most
unexceptionable applicant  on his own terms  and as a great favour 
that he would let it at all 

how quick come the reasons for approving what we like   lady russell had
another excellent one at hand  for being extremely glad that sir walter
and his family were to remove from the country   elizabeth had been
lately forming an intimacy  which she wished to see interrupted 
it was with the daughter of mr shepherd  who had returned 
after an unprosperous marriage  to her father s house  with
the additional burden of two children   she was a clever young woman 
who understood the art of pleasing  the art of pleasing  at least 
at kellynch hall  and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot 
as to have been already staying there more than once  in spite of all
that lady russell  who thought it a friendship quite out of place 
could hint of caution and reserve 

lady russell  indeed  had scarcely any influence with elizabeth 
and seemed to love her  rather because she would love her 
than because elizabeth deserved it   she had never received from her more
than outward attention  nothing beyond the observances of complaisance 
had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry 
against previous inclination   she had been repeatedly very earnest
in trying to get anne included in the visit to london  sensibly open
to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements
which shut her out  and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured
to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience 
but always in vain   elizabeth would go her own way  and never had she
pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in
this selection of mrs clay  turning from the society of so deserving
a sister  to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought
to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility 

from situation  mrs clay was  in lady russell s estimate  a very unequal 
and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion 
and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind  and bring a choice
of more suitable intimates within miss elliot s reach  was therefore
an object of first rate importance 



chapter 3


 i must take leave to observe  sir walter   said mr shepherd
one morning at kellynch hall  as he laid down the newspaper 
 that the present juncture is much in our favour   this peace will
be turning all our rich naval officers ashore   they will be
all wanting a home   could not be a better time  sir walter 
for having a choice of tenants  very responsible tenants 
many a noble fortune has been made during the war   if a rich admiral
were to come in our way  sir walter   

 he would be a very lucky man  shepherd   replied sir walter 
 that s all i have to remark   a prize indeed would kellynch hall
be to him  rather the greatest prize of all  let him have taken
ever so many before  hey  shepherd  

mr shepherd laughed  as he knew he must  at this wit  and then added  

 i presume to observe  sir walter  that  in the way of business 
gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with   i have had a little knowledge
of their methods of doing business  and i am free to confess that they
have very liberal notions  and are as likely to make desirable tenants
as any set of people one should meet with   therefore  sir walter 
what i would take leave to suggest is  that if in consequence of
any rumours getting abroad of your intention  which must be contemplated
as a possible thing  because we know how difficult it is to keep
the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice
and curiosity of the other  consequence has its tax  i  john shepherd 
might conceal any family matters that i chose  for nobody would think it
worth their while to observe me  but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him
which it may be very difficult to elude  and therefore  thus much
i venture upon  that it will not greatly surprise me if 
with all our caution  some rumour of the truth should get abroad 
in the supposition of which  as i was going to observe  since applications
will unquestionably follow  i should think any from our wealthy
naval commanders particularly worth attending to  and beg leave to add 
that two hours will bring me over at any time  to save you
the trouble of replying  

sir walter only nodded   but soon afterwards  rising and pacing the room 
he observed sarcastically  

 there are few among the gentlemen of the navy  i imagine  who would
not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description  

 they would look around them  no doubt  and bless their good fortune  
said mrs clay  for mrs clay was present   her father had driven her over 
nothing being of so much use to mrs clay s health as a drive to kellynch 
 but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be
a very desirable tenant   i have known a good deal of the profession 
and besides their liberality  they are so neat and careful
in all their ways   these valuable pictures of yours  sir walter 
if you chose to leave them  would be perfectly safe   everything in
and about the house would be taken such excellent care of 
the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order
as they are now   you need not be afraid  miss elliot  of your own
sweet flower gardens being neglected  

 as to all that   rejoined sir walter coolly   supposing i were induced
to let my house  i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges
to be annexed to it   i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant 
the park would be open to him of course  and few navy officers 
or men of any other description  can have had such a range 
but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds 
is another thing   i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being
always approachable  and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard
with respect to her flower garden   i am very little disposed
to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour 
i assure you  be he sailor or soldier  

after a short pause  mr shepherd presumed to say  

 in all these cases  there are established usages which
make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant 
your interest  sir walter  is in pretty safe hands   depend upon me
for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights 
i venture to hint  that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous
for his own  as john shepherd will be for him  

here anne spoke  

 the navy  i think  who have done so much for us  have at least
an equal claim with any other set of men  for all the comforts and
all the privileges which any home can give   sailors work hard enough
for their comforts  we must all allow  

 very true  very true   what miss anne says  is very true  
was mr shepherd s rejoinder  and  oh  certainly   was his daughter s 
but sir walter s remark was  soon afterwards  

 the profession has its utility  but i should be sorry to see
any friend of mine belonging to it  

 indeed   was the reply  and with a look of surprise 

 yes  it is in two points offensive to me  i have two strong grounds
of objection to it   first  as being the means of bringing persons
of obscure birth into undue distinction  and raising men to honours
which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of  and secondly 
as it cuts up a man s youth and vigour most horribly  a sailor grows old
sooner than any other man   i have observed it all my life 
a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise
of one whose father  his father might have disdained to speak to 
and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself  than in
any other line   one day last spring  in town  i was in company
with two men  striking instances of what i am talking of 
lord st ives  whose father we all know to have been a country curate 
without bread to eat  i was to give place to lord st ives 
and a certain admiral baldwin  the most deplorable looking personage
you can imagine  his face the colour of mahogany  rough and rugged
to the last degree  all lines and wrinkles  nine grey hairs of a side 
and nothing but a dab of powder at top    in the name of heaven 
who is that old fellow   said i to a friend of mine who was standing near 
 sir basil morley     old fellow   cried sir basil   it is admiral baldwin 
what do you take his age to be     sixty   said i   or perhaps sixty two  
 forty   replied sir basil   forty  and no more    picture to yourselves
my amazement  i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin 
i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do 
but to a degree  i know it is the same with them all   they are all
knocked about  and exposed to every climate  and every weather 
till they are not fit to be seen   it is a pity they are not knocked
on the head at once  before they reach admiral baldwin s age  

 nay  sir walter   cried mrs clay   this is being severe indeed 
have a little mercy on the poor men   we are not all born to be handsome 
the sea is no beautifier  certainly  sailors do grow old betimes 
i have observed it  they soon lose the look of youth   but then 
is not it the same with many other professions  perhaps most other 
soldiers  in active service  are not at all better off   and even in
the quieter professions  there is a toil and a labour of the mind 
if not of the body  which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural
effect of time   the lawyer plods  quite care worn  the physician
is up at all hours  and travelling in all weather  and even
the clergyman    she stopt a moment to consider what might
do for the clergyman    and even the clergyman  you know is obliged
to go into infected rooms  and expose his health and looks to
all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere   in fact  as i have
long been convinced  though every profession is necessary and honourable
in its turn  it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any 
who can live in a regular way  in the country  choosing their own hours 
following their own pursuits  and living on their own property 
without the torment of trying for more  it is only their lot  i say 
to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost 
i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness
when they cease to be quite young  

it seemed as if mr shepherd  in this anxiety to bespeak
sir walter s good will towards a naval officer as tenant 
had been gifted with foresight  for the very first application
for the house was from an admiral croft  with whom he shortly afterwards
fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton  and indeed 
he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent 
by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make 
admiral croft was a native of somersetshire  who having acquired
a very handsome fortune  was wishing to settle in his own country 
and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places
in that immediate neighbourhood  which  however  had not suited him 
that accidentally hearing   it was just as he had foretold 
mr shepherd observed  sir walter s concerns could not be kept a secret    
accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let 
and understanding his  mr shepherd s  connection with the owner 
he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries 
and had  in the course of a pretty long conference  expressed as strong
an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description
could feel  and given mr shepherd  in his explicit account of himself 
every proof of his being a most responsible  eligible tenant 

 and who is admiral croft   was sir walter s cold suspicious inquiry 

mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman s family 
and mentioned a place  and anne  after the little pause which followed 
added  

 he is a rear admiral of the white   he was in the trafalgar action 
and has been in the east indies since  he was stationed there 
i believe  several years  

 then i take it for granted   observed sir walter   that his face
is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery  

mr shepherd hastened to assure him  that admiral croft was a very hale 
hearty  well looking man  a little weather beaten  to be sure 
but not much  and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour 
not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms  only wanted
a comfortable home  and to get into it as soon as possible 
knew he must pay for his convenience  knew what rent a ready furnished
house of that consequence might fetch  should not have been surprised
if sir walter had asked more  had inquired about the manor 
would be glad of the deputation  certainly  but made no great point of it 
said he sometimes took out a gun  but never killed  quite the gentleman 

mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject  pointing out all
the circumstances of the admiral s family  which made him
peculiarly desirable as a tenant   he was a married man 
and without children  the very state to be wished for   a house was
never taken good care of  mr shepherd observed  without a lady 
he did not know  whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering
as much where there was no lady  as where there were many children 
a lady  without a family  was the very best preserver of furniture
in the world   he had seen mrs croft  too  she was at taunton
with the admiral  and had been present almost all the time they were
talking the matter over 

 and a very well spoken  genteel  shrewd lady  she seemed to be  
continued he   asked more questions about the house  and terms 
and taxes  than the admiral himself  and seemed more conversant
with business  and moreover  sir walter  i found she was not quite
unconnected in this country  any more than her husband  that is to say 
she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once 
she told me so herself   sister to the gentleman who lived
a few years back at monkford   bless me  what was his name 
at this moment i cannot recollect his name  though i have heard it so lately 
penelope  my dear  can you help me to the name of the gentleman
who lived at monkford   mrs croft s brother  

but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot  that she did not
hear the appeal 

 i have no conception whom you can mean  shepherd  i remember
no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent  

 bless me  how very odd   i shall forget my own name soon  i suppose 
a name that i am so very well acquainted with  knew the gentleman
so well by sight  seen him a hundred times  came to consult me once 
i remember  about a trespass of one of his neighbours  farmer s man
breaking into his orchard  wall torn down  apples stolen 
caught in the fact  and afterwards  contrary to my judgement 
submitted to an amicable compromise   very odd indeed  

after waiting another moment  

 you mean mr wentworth  i suppose   said anne 

mr shepherd was all gratitude 

 wentworth was the very name   mr wentworth was the very man 
he had the curacy of monkford  you know  sir walter  some time back 
for two or three years   came there about the year    5  i take it 
you remember him  i am sure  

 wentworth   oh  ay   mr wentworth  the curate of monkford 
you misled me by the term gentleman   i thought you were speaking of
some man of property   mr wentworth was nobody  i remember 
quite unconnected  nothing to do with the strafford family 
one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common  

as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them
no service with sir walter  he mentioned it no more  returning 
with all his zeal  to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably
in their favour  their age  and number  and fortune  the high idea
they had formed of kellynch hall  and extreme solicitude for
the advantage of renting it  making it appear as if they ranked
nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot 
an extraordinary taste  certainly  could they have been supposed in
the secret of sir walter s estimate of the dues of a tenant 

it succeeded  however  and though sir walter must ever look with
an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house  and think them
infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms 
he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty 
and authorising him to wait on admiral croft  who still remained
at taunton  and fix a day for the house being seen 

sir walter was not very wise  but still he had experience enough
of the world to feel  that a more unobjectionable tenant 
in all essentials  than admiral croft bid fair to be  could hardly offer 
so far went his understanding  and his vanity supplied a little
additional soothing  in the admiral s situation in life  which was just
high enough  and not too high    i have let my house to admiral croft  
would sound extremely well  very much better than to any mere mr   
a mr  save  perhaps  some half dozen in the nation   always needs
a note of explanation   an admiral speaks his own consequence 
and  at the same time  can never make a baronet look small 
in all their dealings and intercourse  sir walter elliot must ever
have the precedence 

nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth 
but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal 
that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand 
and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her 

mr shepherd was completely empowered to act  and no sooner had
such an end been reached  than anne  who had been a most attentive listener
to the whole  left the room  to seek the comfort of cool air for her
flushed cheeks  and as she walked along a favourite grove  said 
with a gentle sigh   a few months more  and he  perhaps 
may be walking here  



chapter 4


he was not mr wentworth  the former curate of monkford 
however suspicious appearances may be  but a captain frederick wentworth 
his brother  who being made commander in consequence of the action
off st domingo  and not immediately employed  had come into somersetshire 
in the summer of 1806  and having no parent living  found a home
for half a year at monkford   he was  at that time  a remarkably fine
young man  with a great deal of intelligence  spirit  and brilliancy 
and anne an extremely pretty girl  with gentleness  modesty  taste 
and feeling   half the sum of attraction  on either side  might have
been enough  for he had nothing to do  and she had hardly anybody to love 
but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail 
they were gradually acquainted  and when acquainted  rapidly and
deeply in love   it would be difficult to say which had seen
highest perfection in the other  or which had been the happiest 
she  in receiving his declarations and proposals  or he in
having them accepted 

a short period of exquisite felicity followed  and but a short one 
troubles soon arose   sir walter  on being applied to  without actually
withholding his consent  or saying it should never be  gave it all
the negative of great astonishment  great coldness  great silence 
and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter 
he thought it a very degrading alliance  and lady russell  though with
more tempered and pardonable pride  received it as a most unfortunate one 

anne elliot  with all her claims of birth  beauty  and mind 
to throw herself away at nineteen  involve herself at nineteen
in an engagement with a young man  who had nothing but himself
to recommend him  and no hopes of attaining affluence  but in the chances
of a most uncertain profession  and no connexions to secure
even his farther rise in the profession  would be  indeed  a throwing away 
which she grieved to think of   anne elliot  so young  known to so few 
to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune 
or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing  anxious 
youth killing dependence   it must not be  if by any fair interference
of friendship  any representations from one who had almost a mother s love 
and mother s rights  it would be prevented 

captain wentworth had no fortune   he had been lucky in his profession 
but spending freely  what had come freely  had realized nothing 
but he was confident that he should soon be rich 
full of life and ardour  he knew that he should soon have a ship 
and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted 
he had always been lucky  he knew he should be so still 
such confidence  powerful in its own warmth  and bewitching in
the wit which often expressed it  must have been enough for anne 
but lady russell saw it very differently   his sanguine temper 
and fearlessness of mind  operated very differently on her 
she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil   it only added a
dangerous character to himself   he was brilliant  he was headstrong 
lady russell had little taste for wit  and of anything approaching
to imprudence a horror   she deprecated the connexion in every light 

such opposition  as these feelings produced  was more than
anne could combat   young and gentle as she was  it might yet
have been possible to withstand her father s ill will 
though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister 
but lady russell  whom she had always loved and relied on  could not 
with such steadiness of opinion  and such tenderness of manner 
be continually advising her in vain   she was persuaded to believe
the engagement a wrong thing   indiscreet  improper  hardly capable
of success  and not deserving it   but it was not a merely selfish caution 
under which she acted  in putting an end to it   had she not
imagined herself consulting his good  even more than her own 
she could hardly have given him up   the belief of being prudent 
and self denying  principally for his advantage  was her chief consolation 
under the misery of a parting  a final parting  and every consolation
was required  for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions 
on his side  totally unconvinced and unbending  and of his feeling himself
ill used by so forced a relinquishment   he had left the country
in consequence 

a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance 
but not with a few months ended anne s share of suffering from it 
her attachment and regrets had  for a long time  clouded every
enjoyment of youth  and an early loss of bloom and spirits
had been their lasting effect 

more than seven years were gone since this little history
of sorrowful interest had reached its close  and time had
softened down much  perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him 
but she had been too dependent on time alone  no aid had been given
in change of place  except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture  
or in any novelty or enlargement of society   no one had ever
come within the kellynch circle  who could bear a comparison with
frederick wentworth  as he stood in her memory   no second attachment 
the only thoroughly natural  happy  and sufficient cure 
at her time of life  had been possible to the nice tone of her mind 
the fastidiousness of her taste  in the small limits of the society
around them   she had been solicited  when about two and twenty 
to change her name  by the young man  who not long afterwards found
a more willing mind in her younger sister  and lady russell had
lamented her refusal  for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man 
whose landed property and general importance were second in that country 
only to sir walter s  and of good character and appearance 
and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more 
while anne was nineteen  she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty two
so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of
her father s house  and settled so permanently near herself 
but in this case  anne had left nothing for advice to do 
and though lady russell  as satisfied as ever with her own discretion 
never wished the past undone  she began now to have the anxiety
which borders on hopelessness for anne s being tempted  by some man
of talents and independence  to enter a state for which she held her
to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits 

they knew not each other s opinion  either its constancy or its change 
on the one leading point of anne s conduct  for the subject was never
alluded to  but anne  at seven and twenty  thought very differently
from what she had been made to think at nineteen   she did not blame
lady russell  she did not blame herself for having been guided by her 
but she felt that were any young person  in similar circumstances 
to apply to her for counsel  they would never receive any of such
certain immediate wretchedness  such uncertain future good 
she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home 
and every anxiety attending his profession  all their probable fears 
delays  and disappointments  she should yet have been a happier woman
in maintaining the engagement  than she had been in the sacrifice of it 
and this  she fully believed  had the usual share  had even more than
the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs 
without reference to the actual results of their case  which 
as it happened  would have bestowed earlier prosperity than
could be reasonably calculated on   all his sanguine expectations 
all his confidence had been justified   his genius and ardour
had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path 
he had  very soon after their engagement ceased  got employ 
and all that he had told her would follow  had taken place 
he had distinguished himself  and early gained the other step in rank 
and must now  by successive captures  have made a handsome fortune 
she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority 
but she could not doubt his being rich  and  in favour of his constancy 
she had no reason to believe him married 

how eloquent could anne elliot have been  how eloquent  at least 
were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment  and a cheerful
confidence in futurity  against that over anxious caution which
seems to insult exertion and distrust providence   she had been forced
into prudence in her youth  she learned romance as she grew older 
the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning 

with all these circumstances  recollections and feelings 
she could not hear that captain wentworth s sister was likely
to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain  and many a stroll 
and many a sigh  were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea 
she often told herself it was folly  before she could harden her nerves
sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts
and their business no evil   she was assisted  however  by that
perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness  among the only three
of her own friends in the secret of the past  which seemed almost to deny
any recollection of it   she could do justice to the superiority
of lady russell s motives in this  over those of her father and elizabeth 
she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness 
but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important
from whatever it sprung  and in the event of admiral croft s really
taking kellynch hall  she rejoiced anew over the conviction which
had always been most grateful to her  of the past being known to
those three only among her connexions  by whom no syllable 
she believed  would ever be whispered  and in the trust that among his 
the brother only with whom he had been residing  had received
any information of their short lived engagement   that brother had been
long removed from the country and being a sensible man  and  moreover 
a single man at the time  she had a fond dependence on no human creature s
having heard of it from him 

the sister  mrs croft  had then been out of england  accompanying
her husband on a foreign station  and her own sister  mary 
had been at school while it all occurred  and never admitted by
the pride of some  and the delicacy of others  to the smallest knowledge
of it afterwards 

with these supports  she hoped that the acquaintance between herself
and the crofts  which  with lady russell  still resident in kellynch 
and mary fixed only three miles off  must be anticipated 
need not involve any particular awkwardness 



chapter 5


on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft s seeing kellynch hall 
anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell s 
and keep out of the way till all was over  when she found it most natural
to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them 

this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory 
and decided the whole business at once   each lady was previously
well disposed for an agreement  and saw nothing  therefore 
but good manners in the other  and with regard to the gentlemen 
there was such an hearty good humour  such an open  trusting liberality
on the admiral s side  as could not but influence sir walter 
who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished
behaviour by mr shepherd s assurances of his being known  by report 
to the admiral  as a model of good breeding 

the house and grounds  and furniture  were approved  the crofts
were approved  terms  time  every thing  and every body  was right 
and mr shepherd s clerks were set to work  without there having been
a single preliminary difference to modify of all that
 this indenture sheweth  

sir walter  without hesitation  declared the admiral to be
the best looking sailor he had ever met with  and went so far as to say 
that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair 
he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where 
and the admiral  with sympathetic cordiality  observed to his wife
as they drove back through the park   i thought we should soon
come to a deal  my dear  in spite of what they told us at taunton 
the baronet will never set the thames on fire  but there seems to be
no harm in him    reciprocal compliments  which would have been
esteemed about equal 

the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas  and as sir walter
proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month 
there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement 

lady russell  convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use 
or any importance  in the choice of the house which they were
going to secure  was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon 
and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might
convey her to bath herself after christmas  but having engagements
of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks 
she was unable to give the full invitation she wished  and anne
though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare
of bath  and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad
of the autumnal months in the country  did not think that 
everything considered  she wished to remain   it would be most right 
and most wise  and  therefore must involve least suffering
to go with the others 

something occurred  however  to give her a different duty 
mary  often a little unwell  and always thinking a great deal
of her own complaints  and always in the habit of claiming anne
when anything was the matter  was indisposed  and foreseeing
that she should not have a day s health all the autumn  entreated 
or rather required her  for it was hardly entreaty  to come to
uppercross cottage  and bear her company as long as she should want her 
instead of going to bath 

 i cannot possibly do without anne   was mary s reasoning 
and elizabeth s reply was   then i am sure anne had better stay 
for nobody will want her in bath  

to be claimed as a good  though in an improper style  is at least
better than being rejected as no good at all  and anne  glad to
be thought of some use  glad to have anything marked out as a duty 
and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country 
and her own dear country  readily agreed to stay 

this invitation of mary s removed all lady russell s difficulties 
and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath
till lady russell took her  and that all the intervening time
should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge 

so far all was perfectly right  but lady russell was almost startled
by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan  when it burst on her 
which was  mrs clay s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter
and elizabeth  as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter
in all the business before her   lady russell was extremely sorry
that such a measure should have been resorted to at all  wondered 
grieved  and feared  and the affront it contained to anne 
in mrs clay s being of so much use  while anne could be of none 
was a very sore aggravation 

anne herself was become hardened to such affronts  but she felt
the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell 
with a great deal of quiet observation  and a knowledge 
which she often wished less  of her father s character  she was
sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy
were more than possible   she did not imagine that her father
had at present an idea of the kind   mrs clay had freckles 
and a projecting tooth  and a clumsy wrist  which he was continually
making severe remarks upon  in her absence  but she was young 
and certainly altogether well looking  and possessed  in an acute mind
and assiduous pleasing manners  infinitely more dangerous attractions
than any merely personal might have been   anne was so impressed
by the degree of their danger  that she could not excuse herself
from trying to make it perceptible to her sister   she had little hope
of success  but elizabeth  who in the event of such a reverse would be
so much more to be pitied than herself  should never  she thought 
have reason to reproach her for giving no warning 

she spoke  and seemed only to offend   elizabeth could not conceive
how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her  and indignantly
answered for each party s perfectly knowing their situation 

 mrs clay   said she  warmly   never forgets who she is 
and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be 
i can assure you  that upon the subject of marriage they are
particularly nice  and that she reprobates all inequality of condition
and rank more strongly than most people   and as to my father 
i really should not have thought that he  who has kept himself single
so long for our sakes  need be suspected now   if mrs clay were
a very beautiful woman  i grant you  it might be wrong to have her
so much with me  not that anything in the world  i am sure 
would induce my father to make a degrading match  but he might
be rendered unhappy   but poor mrs clay who  with all her merits 
can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty  i really think poor
mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety   one would imagine
you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes 
though i know you must fifty times   that tooth of her s
and those freckles   freckles do not disgust me so very much
as they do him   i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few 
but he abominates them   you must have heard him notice
mrs clay s freckles  

 there is hardly any personal defect   replied anne 
 which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to  

 i think very differently   answered elizabeth  shortly 
 an agreeable manner may set off handsome features  but can never
alter plain ones   however  at any rate  as i have a great deal more
at stake on this point than anybody else can have  i think it
rather unnecessary in you to be advising me  

anne had done  glad that it was over  and not absolutely hopeless
of doing good   elizabeth  though resenting the suspicion 
might yet be made observant by it 

the last office of the four carriage horses was to draw sir walter 
miss elliot  and mrs clay to bath   the party drove off in very good spirits 
sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted
tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves 
and anne walked up at the same time  in a sort of desolate tranquillity 
to the lodge  where she was to spend the first week 

her friend was not in better spirits than herself  lady russell felt this
break up of the family exceedingly   their respectability was
as dear to her as her own  and a daily intercourse had become
precious by habit   it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds 
and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into 
and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village 
and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived 
she had determined to make her own absence from home begin
when she must give up anne   accordingly their removal was made together 
and anne was set down at uppercross cottage  in the first stage
of lady russell s journey 

uppercross was a moderate sized village  which a few years back
had been completely in the old english style  containing only
two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers 
the mansion of the squire  with its high walls  great gates  and old trees 
substantial and unmodernized  and the compact  tight parsonage 
enclosed in its own neat garden  with a vine and a pear tree
trained round its casements  but upon the marriage of the young  squire 
it had received the improvement of a farm house elevated into a cottage 
for his residence  and uppercross cottage  with its veranda 
french windows  and other prettiness  was quite as likely to catch
the traveller s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect
and premises of the great house  about a quarter of a mile farther on 

here anne had often been staying   she knew the ways of uppercross
as well as those of kellynch   the two families were so continually meeting 
so much in the habit of running in and out of each other s house
at all hours  that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone 
but being alone  her being unwell and out of spirits was almost
a matter of course   though better endowed than the elder sister 
mary had not anne s understanding nor temper   while well  and happy 
and properly attended to  she had great good humour and excellent spirits 
but any indisposition sunk her completely   she had no resources
for solitude  and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot
self importance  was very prone to add to every other distress
that of fancying herself neglected and ill used   in person  she was
inferior to both sisters  and had  even in her bloom  only reached
the dignity of being  a fine girl    she was now lying on the faded sofa
of the pretty little drawing room  the once elegant furniture of which
had been gradually growing shabby  under the influence of four summers
and two children  and  on anne s appearing  greeted her with  

 so  you are come at last   i began to think i should never see you 
i am so ill i can hardly speak   i have not seen a creature
the whole morning  

 i am sorry to find you unwell   replied anne    you sent me
such a good account of yourself on thursday  

 yes  i made the best of it  i always do   but i was very far from well
at the time  and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life
as i have been all this morning   very unfit to be left alone  i am sure 
suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way 
and not able to ring the bell   so  lady russell would not get out 
i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer  

anne said what was proper  and enquired after her husband 
 oh  charles is out shooting   i have not seen him since seven o clock 
he would go  though i told him how ill i was   he said he should not
stay out long  but he has never come back  and now it is almost one 
i assure you  i have not seen a soul this whole long morning  

 you have had your little boys with you  

 yes  as long as i could bear their noise  but they are so unmanageable
that they do me more harm than good   little charles does not mind
a word i say  and walter is growing quite as bad  

 well  you will soon be better now   replied anne  cheerfully 
 you know i always cure you when i come   how are your neighbours
at the great house  

 i can give you no account of them   i have not seen one of them to day 
except mr musgrove  who just stopped and spoke through the window 
but without getting off his horse  and though i told him how ill i was 
not one of them have been near me   it did not happen to suit
the miss musgroves  i suppose  and they never put themselves
out of their way  

 you will see them yet  perhaps  before the morning is gone 
it is early  

 i never want them  i assure you   they talk and laugh a great deal
too much for me   oh  anne  i am so very unwell   it was quite unkind
of you not to come on thursday  

 my dear mary  recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself 
you wrote in the cheerfullest manner  and said you were perfectly well 
and in no hurry for me  and that being the case  you must be aware
that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last 
and besides what i felt on her account  i have really been so busy 
have had so much to do  that i could not very conveniently have
left kellynch sooner  

 dear me  what can you possibly have to do  

 a great many things  i assure you   more than i can recollect
in a moment  but i can tell you some   i have been making
a duplicate of the catalogue of my father s books and pictures 
i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie 
trying to understand  and make him understand  which of elizabeth s plants
are for lady russell   i have had all my own little concerns
to arrange  books and music to divide  and all my trunks to repack 
from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons 
and one thing i have had to do  mary  of a more trying nature 
going to almost every house in the parish  as a sort of take leave 
i was told that they wished it   but all these things took up
a great deal of time  

 oh  well   and after a moment s pause   but you have never asked me
one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday  

 did you go then   i have made no enquiries  because i concluded
you must have been obliged to give up the party  

 oh yes  i went   i was very well yesterday  nothing at all
the matter with me till this morning   it would have been strange
if i had not gone  

 i am very glad you were well enough  and i hope you had a pleasant party  

 nothing remarkable   one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be 
and who will be there  and it is so very uncomfortable not having
a carriage of one s own   mr and mrs musgrove took me  and we were
so crowded   they are both so very large  and take up so much room 
and mr musgrove always sits forward   so  there was i  crowded into
the back seat with henrietta and louise  and i think it very likely
that my illness to day may be owing to it  

a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness
on anne s side produced nearly a cure on mary s   she could soon
sit upright on the sofa  and began to hope she might be able
to leave it by dinner time   then  forgetting to think of it 
she was at the other end of the room  beautifying a nosegay 
then  she ate her cold meat  and then she was well enough
to propose a little walk 

 where shall we go   said she  when they were ready    i suppose
you will not like to call at the great house before they have
been to see you  

 i have not the smallest objection on that account   replied anne 
 i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know
so well as mrs and the miss musgroves  

 oh  but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible 
they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister   however 
we may as well go and sit with them a little  while  and when we
have that over  we can enjoy our walk  

anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent 
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it  from believing that 
though there were on each side continual subjects of offence 
neither family could now do without it   to the great house accordingly
they went  to sit the full half hour in the old fashioned square parlour 
with a small carpet and shining floor  to which the present
daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion
by a grand piano forte and a harp  flower stands and little tables
placed in every direction   oh  could the originals of the portraits
against the wainscot  could the gentlemen in brown velvet and
the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on  have been conscious
of such an overthrow of all order and neatness   the portraits themselves
seemed to be staring in astonishment 

the musgroves  like their houses  were in a state of alteration 
perhaps of improvement   the father and mother were in the old
english style  and the young people in the new   mr and mrs musgrove
were a very good sort of people  friendly and hospitable 
not much educated  and not at all elegant   their children had
more modern minds and manners   there was a numerous family 
but the only two grown up  excepting charles  were henrietta and louisa 
young ladies of nineteen and twenty  who had brought from school at exeter
all the usual stock of accomplishments  and were now like thousands
of other young ladies  living to be fashionable  happy  and merry 
their dress had every advantage  their faces were rather pretty 
their spirits extremely good  their manner unembarrassed and pleasant 
they were of consequence at home  and favourites abroad 
anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures
of her acquaintance  but still  saved as we all are  by some
comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility
of exchange  she would not have given up her own more elegant
and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments  and envied them nothing
but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together 
that good humoured mutual affection  of which she had known
so little herself with either of her sisters 

they were received with great cordiality   nothing seemed amiss
on the side of the great house family  which was generally 
as anne very well knew  the least to blame   the half hour was
chatted away pleasantly enough  and she was not at all surprised
at the end of it  to have their walking party joined by both
the miss musgroves  at mary s particular invitation 



chapter 6


anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross  to learn that a removal
from one set of people to another  though at a distance of only three miles 
will often include a total change of conversation  opinion  and idea 
she had never been staying there before  without being struck by it 
or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage
in seeing how unknown  or unconsidered there  were the affairs
which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity
and pervading interest  yet  with all this experience  she believed
she must now submit to feel that another lesson  in the art of knowing
our own nothingness beyond our own circle  was become necessary for her 
for certainly  coming as she did  with a heart full of the subject
which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks 
she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found
in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove 
 so  miss anne  sir walter and your sister are gone  and what part of bath
do you think they will settle in   and this  without much
waiting for an answer  or in the young ladies  addition of 
 i hope we shall be in bath in the winter  but remember  papa 
if we do go  we must be in a good situation   none of your
queen squares for us   or in the anxious supplement from mary  of  
 upon my word  i shall be pretty well off  when you are all gone away
to be happy at bath  

she could only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future 
and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing
of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell 

the mr musgroves had their own game to guard  and to destroy 
their own horses  dogs  and newspapers to engage them  and the females
were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping 
neighbours  dress  dancing  and music   she acknowledged it to be
very fitting  that every little social commonwealth should dictate
its own matters of discourse  and hoped  ere long  to become
a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into 
with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross 
it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination  her memory 
and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible 

she had no dread of these two months   mary was not so repulsive
and unsisterly as elizabeth  nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers 
neither was there anything among the other component parts
of the cottage inimical to comfort   she was always on friendly terms
with her brother in law  and in the children  who loved her nearly as well 
and respected her a great deal more than their mother  she had
an object of interest  amusement  and wholesome exertion 

charles musgrove was civil and agreeable  in sense and temper he was
undoubtedly superior to his wife  but not of powers  or conversation 
or grace  to make the past  as they were connected together 
at all a dangerous contemplation  though  at the same time 
anne could believe  with lady russell  that a more equal match
might have greatly improved him  and that a woman of real understanding
might have given more consequence to his character  and more usefulness 
rationality  and elegance to his habits and pursuits   as it was 
he did nothing with much zeal  but sport  and his time was otherwise
trifled away  without benefit from books or anything else 
he had very good spirits  which never seemed much affected by
his wife s occasional lowness  bore with her unreasonableness
sometimes to anne s admiration  and upon the whole  though there was
very often a little disagreement  in which she had sometimes more share
than she wished  being appealed to by both parties   they might pass
for a happy couple   they were always perfectly agreed in the want
of more money  and a strong inclination for a handsome present
from his father  but here  as on most topics  he had the superiority 
for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made 
he always contended for his father s having many other uses for his money 
and a right to spend it as he liked 

as to the management of their children  his theory was much better
than his wife s  and his practice not so bad    i could manage them
very well  if it were not for mary s interference   was what
anne often heard him say  and had a good deal of faith in 
but when listening in turn to mary s reproach of  charles spoils
the children so that i cannot get them into any order   she never had
the smallest temptation to say   very true  

one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there
was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties 
and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house 
known to have some influence with her sister  she was continually requested 
or at least receiving hints to exert it  beyond what was practicable 
 i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill  
was charles s language  and  in an unhappy mood  thus spoke mary 
 i do believe if charles were to see me dying  he would not think
there was anything the matter with me   i am sure  anne  if you would 
you might persuade him that i really am very ill  a great deal worse
than i ever own  

mary s declaration was   i hate sending the children to the great house 
though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them  for she humours
and indulges them to such a degree  and gives them so much trash
and sweet things  that they are sure to come back sick and cross
for the rest of the day    and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity
of being alone with anne  to say   oh  miss anne  i cannot help wishing
mrs charles had a little of your method with those children 
they are quite different creatures with you   but to be sure 
in general they are so spoilt   it is a pity you cannot put your sister
in the way of managing them   they are as fine healthy children
as ever were seen  poor little dears  without partiality 
but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated   
bless me  how troublesome they are sometimes   i assure you  miss anne 
it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as
i otherwise should   i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased
with my not inviting them oftener  but you know it is very bad
to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking
every moment   don t do this   and  don t do that    or that one can
only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them  

she had this communication  moreover  from mary    mrs musgrove thinks
all her servants so steady  that it would be high treason
to call it in question  but i am sure  without exaggeration 
that her upper house maid and laundry maid  instead of being
in their business  are gadding about the village  all day long 
i meet them wherever i go  and i declare  i never go twice into my nursery
without seeing something of them   if jemima were not the trustiest 
steadiest creature in the world  it would be enough to spoil her 
for she tells me  they are always tempting her to take a walk with them  
and on mrs musgrove s side  it was   i make a rule of never interfering
in any of my daughter in law s concerns  for i know it would not do 
but i shall tell you  miss anne  because you may be able to set things
to rights  that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles s nursery maid 
i hear strange stories of her  she is always upon the gad  and from
my own knowledge  i can declare  she is such a fine dressing lady 
that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near 
mrs charles quite swears by her  i know  but i just give you this hint 
that you may be upon the watch  because  if you see anything amiss 
you need not be afraid of mentioning it  

again  it was mary s complaint  that mrs musgrove was very apt
not to give her the precedence that was her due  when they dined
at the great house with other families  and she did not see any reason
why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place 
and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves  one of them
after talking of rank  people of rank  and jealousy of rank  said 
 i have no scruple of observing to you  how nonsensical some persons are
about their place  because all the world knows how easy and indifferent
you are about it  but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that
it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious 
especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take
place of mamma   nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma 
but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it 
it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world 
but i know it is taken notice of by many persons  

how was anne to set all these matters to rights   she could do little more
than listen patiently  soften every grievance  and excuse each
to the other  give them all hints of the forbearance necessary
between such near neighbours  and make those hints broadest
which were meant for her sister s benefit 

in all other respects  her visit began and proceeded very well 
her own spirits improved by change of place and subject 
by being removed three miles from kellynch  mary s ailments lessened
by having a constant companion  and their daily intercourse
with the other family  since there was neither superior affection 
confidence  nor employment in the cottage  to be interrupted by it 
was rather an advantage   it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible 
for they met every morning  and hardly ever spent an evening asunder 
but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight
of mr and mrs musgrove s respectable forms in the usual places 
or without the talking  laughing  and singing of their daughters 

she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves 
but having no voice  no knowledge of the harp  and no fond parents 
to sit by and fancy themselves delighted  her performance was
little thought of  only out of civility  or to refresh the others 
as she was well aware   she knew that when she played she was
giving pleasure only to herself  but this was no new sensation 
excepting one short period of her life  she had never  since the age
of fourteen  never since the loss of her dear mother  known the happiness
of being listened to  or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste 
in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world 
and mr and mrs musgrove s fond partiality for their own daughters 
performance  and total indifference to any other person s 
gave her much more pleasure for their sakes  than mortification
for her own 

the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company 
the neighbourhood was not large  but the musgroves were visited
by everybody  and had more dinner parties  and more callers 
more visitors by invitation and by chance  than any other family 
there were more completely popular 

the girls were wild for dancing  and the evenings ended  occasionally 
in an unpremeditated little ball   there was a family of cousins
within a walk of uppercross  in less affluent circumstances 
who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures   they would come
at any time  and help play at anything  or dance anywhere  and anne 
very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post 
played country dances to them by the hour together  a kindness which
always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove
more than anything else  and often drew this compliment   
 well done  miss anne  very well done indeed   lord bless me 
how those little fingers of yours fly about  

so passed the first three weeks   michaelmas came  and now anne s heart
must be in kellynch again   a beloved home made over to others 
all the precious rooms and furniture  groves  and prospects 
beginning to own other eyes and other limbs   she could not
think of much else on the 29th of september  and she had this
sympathetic touch in the evening from mary  who  on having occasion
to note down the day of the month  exclaimed   dear me  is not this
the day the crofts were to come to kellynch   i am glad i did not
think of it before   how low it makes me  

the crofts took possession with true naval alertness  and were
to be visited   mary deplored the necessity for herself 
 nobody knew how much she should suffer   she should put it off
as long as she could   but was not easy till she had talked charles
into driving her over on an early day  and was in a very animated 
comfortable state of imaginary agitation  when she came back 
anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going 
she wished  however to see the crofts  and was glad to be within
when the visit was returned   they came   the master of the house
was not at home  but the two sisters were together  and as it chanced
that mrs croft fell to the share of anne  while the admiral sat by mary 
and made himself very agreeable by his good humoured notice
of her little boys  she was well able to watch for a likeness 
and if it failed her in the features  to catch it in the voice 
or in the turn of sentiment and expression 

mrs croft  though neither tall nor fat  had a squareness 
uprightness  and vigour of form  which gave importance to her person 
she had bright dark eyes  good teeth  and altogether an agreeable face 
though her reddened and weather beaten complexion  the consequence
of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband  made her seem to
have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight and thirty 
her manners were open  easy  and decided  like one who had
no distrust of herself  and no doubts of what to do  without any
approach to coarseness  however  or any want of good humour 
anne gave her credit  indeed  for feelings of great consideration
towards herself  in all that related to kellynch  and it pleased her 
especially  as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute 
in the instant even of introduction  that there was not the smallest
symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft s side  to give a bias
of any sort   she was quite easy on that head  and consequently
full of strength and courage  till for a moment electrified by
mrs croft s suddenly saying   

 it was you  and not your sister  i find  that my brother had
the pleasure of being acquainted with  when he was in this country  

anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing  but the age of emotion
she certainly had not 

 perhaps you may not have heard that he is married   added mrs croft 

she could now answer as she ought  and was happy to feel 
when mrs croft s next words explained it to be mr wentworth
of whom she spoke  that she had said nothing which might not do
for either brother  she immediately felt how reasonable it was 
that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward 
and not of frederick  and with shame at her own forgetfulness
applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour s
present state with proper interest 

the rest was all tranquillity  till  just as they were moving 
she heard the admiral say to mary  

 we are expecting a brother of mrs croft s here soon  i dare say
you know him by name  

he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys 
clinging to him like an old friend  and declaring he should not go 
and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away
in his coat pockets   c   to have another moment for finishing
or recollecting what he had begun  anne was left to persuade herself 
as well as she could  that the same brother must still be in question 
she could not  however  reach such a degree of certainty 
as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject
at the other house  where the crofts had previously been calling 

the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day
at the cottage  and it being now too late in the year for such visits
to be made on foot  the coach was beginning to be listened for 
when the youngest miss musgrove walked in   that she was coming
to apologize  and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves 
was the first black idea  and mary was quite ready to be affronted 
when louisa made all right by saying  that she only came on foot 
to leave more room for the harp  which was bringing in the carriage 

 and i will tell you our reason   she added   and all about it 
i am come on to give you notice  that papa and mamma are
out of spirits this evening  especially mamma  she is thinking so much
of poor richard   and we agreed it would be best to have the harp 
for it seems to amuse her more than the piano forte   i will tell you
why she is out of spirits   when the crofts called this morning 
 they called here afterwards  did not they    they happened to say 
that her brother  captain wentworth  is just returned to england 
or paid off  or something  and is coming to see them almost directly 
and most unluckily it came into mamma s head  when they were gone 
that wentworth  or something very like it  was the name of
poor richard s captain at one time  i do not know when or where 
but a great while before he died  poor fellow   and upon looking over
his letters and things  she found it was so  and is perfectly sure
that this must be the very man  and her head is quite full of it 
and of poor richard   so we must be as merry as we can  that she may not
be dwelling upon such gloomy things  

the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were 
that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome 
hopeless son  and the good fortune to lose him before he reached
his twentieth year  that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid
and unmanageable on shore  that he had been very little cared for
at any time by his family  though quite as much as he deserved 
seldom heard of  and scarcely at all regretted  when the intelligence
of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross  two years before 

he had  in fact  though his sisters were now doing all they could for him 
by calling him  poor richard   been nothing better than a thick headed 
unfeeling  unprofitable dick musgrove  who had never done anything
to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name 
living or dead 

he had been several years at sea  and had  in the course of those removals
to which all midshipmen are liable  and especially such midshipmen
as every captain wishes to get rid of  been six months on board
captain frederick wentworth s frigate  the laconia  and from the laconia
he had  under the influence of his captain  written the only two letters
which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole
of his absence  that is to say  the only two disinterested letters 
all the rest had been mere applications for money 

in each letter he had spoken well of his captain  but yet 
so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters 
so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships 
that it had made scarcely any impression at the time  and that mrs musgrove
should have been suddenly struck  this very day  with a recollection
of the name of wentworth  as connected with her son  seemed one of those
extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur 

she had gone to her letters  and found it all as she supposed 
and the re perusal of these letters  after so long an interval 
her poor son gone for ever  and all the strength of his faults forgotten 
had affected her spirits exceedingly  and thrown her into
greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death 
mr musgrove was  in a lesser degree  affected likewise  and when
they reached the cottage  they were evidently in want  first 
of being listened to anew on this subject  and afterwards 
of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them 

to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth  repeating his name
so often  puzzling over past years  and at last ascertaining that it might 
that it probably would  turn out to be the very same captain wentworth
whom they recollected meeting  once or twice  after their coming back
from clifton  a very fine young man  but they could not say whether
it was seven or eight years ago  was a new sort of trial to anne s nerves 
she found  however  that it was one to which she must inure herself 
since he actually was expected in the country  she must teach herself
to be insensible on such points   and not only did it appear that
he was expected  and speedily  but the musgroves  in their warm gratitude
for the kindness he had shewn poor dick  and very high respect
for his character  stamped as it was by poor dick s having been
six months under his care  and mentioning him in strong 
though not perfectly well spelt praise  as  a fine dashing felow 
only two perticular about the schoolmaster   were bent on
introducing themselves  and seeking his acquaintance  as soon as
they could hear of his arrival 

the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening 



chapter 7


a very few days more  and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch 
and mr musgrove had called on him  and come back warm in his praise 
and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross 
by the end of another week   it had been a great disappointment
to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed 
so impatient was he to shew his gratitude  by seeing captain wentworth
under his own roof  and welcoming him to all that was strongest
and best in his cellars   but a week must pass  only a week 
in anne s reckoning  and then  she supposed  they must meet 
and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week 

captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove s civility 
and she was all but calling there in the same half hour 
she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house 
where  as she afterwards learnt  they must inevitably have found him 
when they were stopped by the eldest boy s being at that moment
brought home in consequence of a bad fall   the child s situation
put the visit entirely aside  but she could not hear of her escape
with indifference  even in the midst of the serious anxiety
which they afterwards felt on his account 

his collar bone was found to be dislocated  and such injury
received in the back  as roused the most alarming ideas 
it was an afternoon of distress  and anne had every thing to do at once 
the apothecary to send for  the father to have pursued and informed 
the mother to support and keep from hysterics  the servants to control 
the youngest child to banish  and the poor suffering one to attend
and soothe  besides sending  as soon as she recollected it 
proper notice to the other house  which brought her an accession
rather of frightened  enquiring companions  than of very useful assistants 

her brother s return was the first comfort  he could take best care
of his wife  and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary 
till he came and had examined the child  their apprehensions were
the worse for being vague  they suspected great injury  but knew not where 
but now the collar bone was soon replaced  and though mr robinson
felt and felt  and rubbed  and looked grave  and spoke low words
both to the father and the aunt  still they were all to hope the best 
and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind 
and then it was  just before they parted  that the two young aunts
were able so far to digress from their nephew s state  as to give
the information of captain wentworth s visit  staying five minutes behind
their father and mother  to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted
they were with him  how much handsomer  how infinitely more agreeable
they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance 
who had been at all a favourite before   how glad they had been
to hear papa invite him to stay dinner  how sorry when he said
it was quite out of his power  and how glad again when he had promised
in reply to papa and mamma s farther pressing invitations to come
and dine with them on the morrow  actually on the morrow 
and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner  as if he felt
all the motive of their attention just as he ought   and in short 
he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace 
that they could assure them all  their heads were both turned by him 
and off they ran  quite as full of glee as of love  and apparently
more full of captain wentworth than of little charles 

the same story and the same raptures were repeated  when the two girls came
with their father  through the gloom of the evening  to make enquiries 
and mr musgrove  no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir 
could add his confirmation and praise  and hope there would be now
no occasion for putting captain wentworth off  and only be sorry to think
that the cottage party  probably  would not like to leave the little boy 
to give him the meeting    oh no  as to leaving the little boy  
both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to bear the thought  and anne  in the joy of the escape 
could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs 

charles musgrove  indeed  afterwards  shewed more of inclination 
 the child was going on so well  and he wished so much to be introduced
to captain wentworth  that  perhaps  he might join them in the evening 
he would not dine from home  but he might walk in for half an hour  
but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife  with  oh  no  indeed 
charles  i cannot bear to have you go away   only think if anything
should happen  

the child had a good night  and was going on well the next day 
it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been
done to the spine  but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm 
and charles musgrove began  consequently  to feel no necessity
for longer confinement   the child was to be kept in bed and amused
as quietly as possible  but what was there for a father to do 
this was quite a female case  and it would be highly absurd in him 
who could be of no use at home  to shut himself up   his father
very much wished him to meet captain wentworth  and there being
no sufficient reason against it  he ought to go  and it ended in his
making a bold  public declaration  when he came in from shooting 
of his meaning to dress directly  and dine at the other house 

 nothing can be going on better than the child   said he 
 so i told my father  just now  that i would come  and he thought me
quite right   your sister being with you  my love  i have no scruple at all 
you would not like to leave him yourself  but you see i can be of no use 
anne will send for me if anything is the matter  

husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain 
mary knew  from charles s manner of speaking  that he was
quite determined on going  and that it would be of no use to teaze him 
she said nothing  therefore  till he was out of the room 
but as soon as there was only anne to hear  

 so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves  with this
poor sick child  and not a creature coming near us all the evening 
i knew how it would be   this is always my luck   if there is
anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it 
and charles is as bad as any of them   very unfeeling   i must say
it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy 
talks of his being going on so well   how does he know that he is
going on well  or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence 
i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling   so here he is to
go away and enjoy himself  and because i am the poor mother 
i am not to be allowed to stir  and yet  i am sure  i am more unfit
than anybody else to be about the child   my being the mother
is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried   i am not at all
equal to it   you saw how hysterical i was yesterday  

 but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm  
of the shock   you will not be hysterical again   i dare say we shall have
nothing to distress us   i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions 
and have no fears  and indeed  mary  i cannot wonder at your husband 
nursing does not belong to a man  it is not his province 
a sick child is always the mother s property   her own feelings
generally make it so  

 i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother  but i do not know
that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles 
for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill 
and you saw  this morning  that if i told him to keep quiet 
he was sure to begin kicking about   i have not nerves
for the sort of thing  

 but  could you be comfortable yourself  to be spending
the whole evening away from the poor boy  

 yes  you see his papa can  and why should not i   jemima is so careful 
and she could send us word every hour how he was   i really think
charles might as well have told his father we would all come 
i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is 
i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday  but the case is very different to day  

 well  if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself 
suppose you were to go  as well as your husband   leave little charles
to my care   mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain
with him  

 are you serious   cried mary  her eyes brightening    dear me 
that s a very good thought  very good  indeed   to be sure 
i may just as well go as not  for i am of no use at home  am i 
and it only harasses me   you  who have not a mother s feelings 
are a great deal the properest person   you can make little charles
do anything  he always minds you at a word   it will be a great deal better
than leaving him only with jemima   oh  i shall certainly go 
i am sure i ought if i can  quite as much as charles  for they want me
excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth  and i know
you do not mind being left alone   an excellent thought of yours 
indeed  anne   i will go and tell charles  and get ready directly 
you can send for us  you know  at a moment s notice  if anything
is the matter  but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you 
i should not go  you may be sure  if i did not feel quite at ease
about my dear child  

the next moment she was tapping at her husband s dressing room door 
and as anne followed her up stairs  she was in time for
the whole conversation  which began with mary s saying 
in a tone of great exultation  

 i mean to go with you  charles  for i am of no more use at home
than you are   if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child 
i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like 
anne will stay  anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him 
it is anne s own proposal  and so i shall go with you  which will be
a great deal better  for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday  

 this is very kind of anne   was her husband s answer   and i should be
very glad to have you go  but it seems rather hard that she should be
left at home by herself  to nurse our sick child  

anne was now at hand to take up her own cause  and the sincerity
of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him  where conviction
was at least very agreeable  he had no farther scruples as to her being
left to dine alone  though he still wanted her to join them in the evening 
when the child might be at rest for the night  and kindly urged her
to let him come and fetch her  but she was quite unpersuadable 
and this being the case  she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them
set off together in high spirits   they were gone  she hoped 
to be happy  however oddly constructed such happiness might seem 
as for herself  she was left with as many sensations of comfort 
as were  perhaps  ever likely to be hers   she knew herself to be
of the first utility to the child  and what was it to her
if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant  making himself
agreeable to others 

she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting 
perhaps indifferent  if indifference could exist under such circumstances 
he must be either indifferent or unwilling   had he wished
ever to see her again  he need not have waited till this time 
he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place
she should have done long ago  when events had been early giving him
the independence which alone had been wanting 

her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance 
and their visit in general   there had been music  singing 
talking  laughing  all that was most agreeable  charming manners
in captain wentworth  no shyness or reserve  they seemed all
to know each other perfectly  and he was coming the very next morning
to shoot with charles   he was to come to breakfast  but not at the cottage 
though that had been proposed at first  but then he had been pressed
to come to the great house instead  and he seemed afraid of being
in mrs charles musgrove s way  on account of the child  and therefore 
somehow  they hardly knew how  it ended in charles s being to meet him
to breakfast at his father s 

anne understood it   he wished to avoid seeing her   he had inquired
after her  she found  slightly  as might suit a former slight acquaintance 
seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged  actuated  perhaps 
by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet 

the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those
of the other house  and on the morrow the difference was so great
that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when
charles came in to say that they were just setting off  that he was
come for his dogs  that his sisters were following with captain wentworth 
his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child  and captain wentworth
proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient 
and though charles had answered for the child s being in no such state
as could make it inconvenient  captain wentworth would not be satisfied
without his running on to give notice 

mary  very much gratified by this attention  was delighted to receive him 
while a thousand feelings rushed on anne  of which this was
the most consoling  that it would soon be over   and it was soon over 
in two minutes after charles s preparation  the others appeared 
they were in the drawing room   her eye half met captain wentworth s 
a bow  a curtsey passed  she heard his voice  he talked to mary 
said all that was right  said something to the miss musgroves 
enough to mark an easy footing  the room seemed full  full of persons
and voices  but a few minutes ended it   charles shewed himself
at the window  all was ready  their visitor had bowed and was gone 
the miss musgroves were gone too  suddenly resolving to walk
to the end of the village with the sportsmen   the room was cleared 
and anne might finish her breakfast as she could 

 it is over  it is over   she repeated to herself again and again 
in nervous gratitude    the worst is over  

mary talked  but she could not attend   she had seen him 
they had met   they had been once more in the same room 

soon  however  she began to reason with herself  and try to be feeling less 
eight years  almost eight years had passed  since all had been given up 
how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval
had banished into distance and indistinctness   what might not
eight years do   events of every description  changes  alienations 
removals  all  all must be comprised in it  and oblivion of the past  
how natural  how certain too   it included nearly a third part
of her own life 

alas  with all her reasoning  she found  that to retentive feelings
eight years may be little more than nothing 

now  how were his sentiments to be read   was this like
wishing to avoid her   and the next moment she was hating herself
for the folly which asked the question 

on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom
might not have prevented  she was soon spared all suspense 
for  after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit
at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary    

 captain wentworth is not very gallant by you  anne  though he was
so attentive to me   henrietta asked him what he thought of you 
when they went away  and he said   you were so altered he should not
have known you again   

mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister s in a common way 
but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound 

 altered beyond his knowledge    anne fully submitted  in silent 
deep mortification   doubtless it was so  and she could take no revenge 
for he was not altered  or not for the worse   she had already
acknowledged it to herself  and she could not think differently 
let him think of her as he would   no   the years which had destroyed
her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing  manly 
open look  in no respect lessening his personal advantages 
she had seen the same frederick wentworth 

 so altered that he should not have known her again    these were words
which could not but dwell with her   yet she soon began to rejoice
that she had heard them   they were of sobering tendency 
they allayed agitation  they composed  and consequently must
make her happier 

frederick wentworth had used such words  or something like them 
but without an idea that they would be carried round to her 
he had thought her wretchedly altered  and in the first moment of appeal 
had spoken as he felt   he had not forgiven anne elliot 
she had used him ill  deserted and disappointed him  and worse 
she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so  which his own decided 
confident temper could not endure   she had given him up to oblige others 
it had been the effect of over persuasion   it had been
weakness and timidity 

he had been most warmly attached to her  and had never seen a woman since
whom he thought her equal  but  except from some natural sensation
of curiosity  he had no desire of meeting her again   her power with him
was gone for ever 

it was now his object to marry   he was rich  and being turned on shore 
fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted 
actually looking round  ready to fall in love with all the speed
which a clear head and a quick taste could allow   he had a heart
for either of the miss musgroves  if they could catch it  a heart 
in short  for any pleasing young woman who came in his way 
excepting anne elliot   this was his only secret exception 
when he said to his sister  in answer to her suppositions   

 yes  here i am  sophia  quite ready to make a foolish match 
anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking 
a little beauty  and a few smiles  and a few compliments to the navy 
and i am a lost man   should not this be enough for a sailor 
who has had no society among women to make him nice  

he said it  she knew  to be contradicted   his bright proud eye
spoke the conviction that he was nice  and anne elliot was
not out of his thoughts  when he more seriously described
the woman he should wish to meet with    a strong mind 
with sweetness of manner   made the first and the last of the description 

 that is the woman i want   said he    something a little inferior
i shall of course put up with  but it must not be much   if i am a fool 
i shall be a fool indeed  for i have thought on the subject
more than most men  



chapter 8


from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly
in the same circle   they were soon dining in company together
at mr musgrove s  for the little boy s state could no longer
supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself  and this was
but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings 

whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof 
former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each 
they could not but be reverted to  the year of their engagement
could not but be named by him  in the little narratives or descriptions
which conversation called forth   his profession qualified him 
his disposition lead him  to talk  and  that was in the year six  
 that happened before i went to sea in the year six   occurred
in the course of the first evening they spent together 
and though his voice did not falter  and though she had no reason
to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke 
anne felt the utter impossibility  from her knowledge of his mind 
that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself 
there must be the same immediate association of thought 
though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain 

they had no conversation together  no intercourse but what
the commonest civility required   once so much to each other 
now nothing   there had been a time  when of all the large party
now filling the drawing room at uppercross  they would have found it
most difficult to cease to speak to one another   with the exception 
perhaps  of admiral and mrs croft  who seemed particularly attached
and happy   anne could allow no other exceptions even among
the married couples   there could have been no two hearts so open 
no tastes so similar  no feelings so in unison  no countenances so beloved 
now they were as strangers  nay  worse than strangers  for they could
never become acquainted   it was a perpetual estrangement 

when he talked  she heard the same voice  and discerned the same mind 
there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party 
and he was very much questioned  and especially by the two miss musgroves 
who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him  as to the manner
of living on board  daily regulations  food  hours   c   and their surprise
at his accounts  at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement
which was practicable  drew from him some pleasant ridicule 
which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant 
and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board
without anything to eat  or any cook to dress it if there were 
or any servant to wait  or any knife and fork to use 

from thus listening and thinking  she was roused by a whisper
of mrs musgrove s who  overcome by fond regrets  could not help saying  

 ah  miss anne  if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son 
i dare say he would have been just such another by this time  

anne suppressed a smile  and listened kindly  while mrs musgrove
relieved her heart a little more  and for a few minutes  therefore 
could not keep pace with the conversation of the others 

when she could let her attention take its natural course again 
she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list
 their own navy list  the first that had ever been at uppercross  
and sitting down together to pore over it  with the professed view
of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded 

 your first was the asp  i remember  we will look for the asp  

 you will not find her there   quite worn out and broken up 
i was the last man who commanded her   hardly fit for service then 
reported fit for home service for a year or two  and so i was sent off
to the west indies  

the girls looked all amazement 

 the admiralty   he continued   entertain themselves now and then 
with sending a few hundred men to sea  in a ship not fit to be employed 
but they have a great many to provide for  and among the thousands
that may just as well go to the bottom as not  it is impossible
for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed  

 phoo  phoo   cried the admiral   what stuff these young fellows talk 
never was a better sloop than the asp in her day   for an old built sloop 
you would not see her equal   lucky fellow to get her   he knows there
must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her
at the same time   lucky fellow to get anything so soon 
with no more interest than his  

 i felt my luck  admiral  i assure you   replied captain wentworth 
seriously    i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire 
it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea 
a very great object  i wanted to be doing something  

 to be sure you did   what should a young fellow like you do ashore
for half a year together   if a man had not a wife  he soon wants
to be afloat again  

 but  captain wentworth   cried louisa   how vexed you must have been
when you came to the asp  to see what an old thing they had given you  

 i knew pretty well what she was before that day   said he  smiling 
 i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to
the fashion and strength of any old pelisse  which you had seen
lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember 
and which at last  on some very wet day  is lent to yourself 
ah  she was a dear old asp to me   she did all that i wanted 
i knew she would   i knew that we should either go to the bottom together 
or that she would be the making of me  and i never had two days
of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her  and after
taking privateers enough to be very entertaining  i had the good luck
in my passage home the next autumn  to fall in with the very french frigate
i wanted   i brought her into plymouth  and here another instance of luck 
we had not been six hours in the sound  when a gale came on 
which lasted four days and nights  and which would have done for
poor old asp in half the time  our touch with the great nation
not having much improved our condition   four and twenty hours later 
and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth 
in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers  and being lost
in only a sloop  nobody would have thought about me   anne s shudderings
were to herself alone  but the miss musgroves could be as open
as they were sincere  in their exclamations of pity and horror 

 and so then  i suppose   said mrs musgrove  in a low voice 
as if thinking aloud   so then he went away to the laconia  and there
he met with our poor boy  charles  my dear    beckoning him to her  
 do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother 
i always forgot  

 it was at gibraltar  mother  i know   dick had been left ill at gibraltar 
with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth  

 oh  but  charles  tell captain wentworth  he need not be afraid
of mentioning poor dick before me  for it would be rather a pleasure
to hear him talked of by such a good friend  

charles  being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case 
only nodded in reply  and walked away 

the girls were now hunting for the laconia  and captain wentworth
could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume
into his own hands to save them the trouble  and once more read aloud
the little statement of her name and rate  and present
non commissioned class  observing over it that she too had been
one of the best friends man ever had 

 ah  those were pleasant days when i had the laconia   how fast i
made money in her   a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise
together off the western islands   poor harville  sister 
you know how much he wanted money   worse than myself   he had a wife 
excellent fellow   i shall never forget his happiness   he felt it all 
so much for her sake   i wished for him again the next summer 
when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean  

 and i am sure  sir   said mrs musgrove   it was a lucky day for us 
when you were put captain into that ship   we shall never forget
what you did  

her feelings made her speak low  and captain wentworth 
hearing only in part  and probably not having dick musgrove at all
near his thoughts  looked rather in suspense  and as if waiting for more 

 my brother   whispered one of the girls   mamma is thinking
of poor richard  

 poor dear fellow   continued mrs musgrove   he was grown so steady 
and such an excellent correspondent  while he was under your care 
ah  it would have been a happy thing  if he had never left you 
i assure you  captain wentworth  we are very sorry he ever left you  

there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth s face at this speech 
a certain glance of his bright eye  and curl of his handsome mouth 
which convinced anne  that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove s kind wishes 
as to her son  he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him 
but it was too transient an indulgence of self amusement to be detected
by any who understood him less than herself  in another moment
he was perfectly collected and serious  and almost instantly afterwards
coming up to the sofa  on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting 
took a place by the latter  and entered into conversation with her 
in a low voice  about her son  doing it with so much sympathy
and natural grace  as shewed the kindest consideration for all
that was real and unabsurd in the parent s feelings 

they were actually on the same sofa  for mrs musgrove had
most readily made room for him  they were divided only by mrs musgrove 
it was no insignificant barrier  indeed   mrs musgrove was of
a comfortable  substantial size  infinitely more fitted by nature
to express good cheer and good humour  than tenderness and sentiment 
and while the agitations of anne s slender form  and pensive face 
may be considered as very completely screened  captain wentworth
should be allowed some credit for the self command with which
he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son 
whom alive nobody had cared for 

personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions 
a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction 
as the most graceful set of limbs in the world   but  fair or not fair 
there are unbecoming conjunctions  which reason will patronize in vain  
which taste cannot tolerate  which ridicule will seize 

the admiral  after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room
with his hands behind him  being called to order by his wife 
now came up to captain wentworth  and without any observation
of what he might be interrupting  thinking only of his own thoughts 
began with  

 if you had been a week later at lisbon  last spring  frederick 
you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson
and her daughters  

 should i   i am glad i was not a week later then  

the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry   he defended himself 
though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies
on board a ship of his  excepting for a ball  or a visit 
which a few hours might comprehend 

 but  if i know myself   said he   this is from no want of gallantry
towards them   it is rather from feeling how impossible it is 
with all one s efforts  and all one s sacrifices  to make
the accommodations on board such as women ought to have 
there can be no want of gallantry  admiral  in rating the claims of women
to every personal comfort high  and this is what i do   i hate to hear
of women on board  or to see them on board  and no ship under my command
shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere  if i can help it  

this brought his sister upon him 

 oh  frederick   but i cannot believe it of you    all idle refinement 
  women may be as comfortable on board  as in the best house in england 
i believe i have lived as much on board as most women  and i know
nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war   i declare
i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me  even at kellynch hall  
 with a kind bow to anne    beyond what i always had in most of
the ships i have lived in  and they have been five altogether  

 nothing to the purpose   replied her brother    you were living
with your husband  and were the only woman on board  

 but you  yourself  brought mrs harville  her sister  her cousin 
and three children  round from portsmouth to plymouth   where was this
superfine  extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then  

 all merged in my friendship  sophia   i would assist any
brother officer s wife that i could  and i would bring anything
of harville s from the world s end  if he wanted it   but do not imagine
that i did not feel it an evil in itself  

 depend upon it  they were all perfectly comfortable  

 i might not like them the better for that perhaps   such a number
of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board  

 my dear frederick  you are talking quite idly   pray  what would
become of us poor sailors  wives  who often want to be conveyed to
one port or another  after our husbands  if everybody had your feelings  

 my feelings  you see  did not prevent my taking mrs harville
and all her family to plymouth  

 but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman 
and as if women were all fine ladies  instead of rational creatures 
we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days  

 ah  my dear   said the admiral   when he had got a wife 
he will sing a different tune   when he is married  if we have
the good luck to live to another war  we shall see him do as you and i 
and a great many others  have done   we shall have him very thankful
to anybody that will bring him his wife  

 ay  that we shall  

 now i have done   cried captain wentworth    when once married
people begin to attack me with    oh  you will think very differently 
when you are married    i can only say   no  i shall not   and then
they say again   yes  you will   and there is an end of it  

he got up and moved away 

 what a great traveller you must have been  ma am   said mrs musgrove
to mrs croft 

 pretty well  ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage 
though many women have done more   i have crossed the atlantic
four times  and have been once to the east indies  and back again 
and only once  besides being in different places about home 
cork  and lisbon  and gibraltar   but i never went beyond the streights 
and never was in the west indies   we do not call bermuda or bahama 
you know  the west indies  

mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent  she could not accuse herself
of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life 

 and i do assure you  ma am   pursued mrs croft   that nothing can exceed
the accommodations of a man of war  i speak  you know  of the higher rates 
when you come to a frigate  of course  you are more confined 
though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them 
and i can safely say  that the happiest part of my life has been spent
on board a ship   while we were together  you know  there was nothing
to be feared   thank god   i have always been blessed with
excellent health  and no climate disagrees with me   a little disordered
always the first twenty four hours of going to sea  but never knew
what sickness was afterwards   the only time i ever really suffered
in body or mind  the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell 
or had any ideas of danger  was the winter that i passed by myself at deal 
when the admiral  captain croft then  was in the north seas 
i lived in perpetual fright at that time  and had all manner of
imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself 
or when i should hear from him next  but as long as we could be together 
nothing ever ailed me  and i never met with the smallest inconvenience  

 aye  to be sure   yes  indeed  oh yes   i am quite of your opinion 
mrs croft   was mrs musgrove s hearty answer    there is nothing so bad
as a separation   i am quite of your opinion   i know what it is 
for mr musgrove always attends the assizes  and i am so glad when
they are over  and he is safe back again  

the evening ended with dancing   on its being proposed 
anne offered her services  as usual  and though her eyes would sometimes
fill with tears as she sat at the instrument  she was extremely glad
to be employed  and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved 

it was a merry  joyous party  and no one seemed in higher spirits
than captain wentworth   she felt that he had every thing to elevate
him which general attention and deference  and especially the attention
of all the young women  could do   the miss hayters  the females
of the family of cousins already mentioned  were apparently admitted
to the honour of being in love with him  and as for henrietta and louisa 
they both seemed so entirely occupied by him  that nothing but
the continued appearance of the most perfect good will between themselves
could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals 
if he were a little spoilt by such universal  such eager admiration 
who could wonder 

these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne  while her fingers
were mechanically at work  proceeding for half an hour together 
equally without error  and without consciousness   once she felt
that he was looking at herself   observing her altered features 
perhaps  trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once
charmed him  and once she knew that he must have spoken of her 
she was hardly aware of it  till she heard the answer  but then she was
sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced 
the answer was   oh  no  never  she has quite given up dancing 
she had rather play   she is never tired of playing    once  too 
he spoke to her   she had left the instrument on the dancing being over 
and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished
to give the miss musgroves an idea of   unintentionally she returned
to that part of the room  he saw her  and  instantly rising 
said  with studied politeness  

 i beg your pardon  madam  this is your seat   and though she immediately
drew back with a decided negative  he was not to be induced
to sit down again 

anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches 
his cold politeness  his ceremonious grace  were worse than anything 



chapter 9


captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home  to stay
as long as he liked  being as thoroughly the object of
the admiral s fraternal kindness as of his wife s   he had intended 
on first arriving  to proceed very soon into shropshire 
and visit the brother settled in that country  but the attractions
of uppercross induced him to put this off   there was so much
of friendliness  and of flattery  and of everything most bewitching
in his reception there  the old were so hospitable  the young so agreeable 
that he could not but resolve to remain where he was  and take all
the charms and perfections of edward s wife upon credit a little longer 

it was soon uppercross with him almost every day   the musgroves
could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come  particularly
in the morning  when he had no companion at home  for the admiral
and mrs croft were generally out of doors together  interesting themselves
in their new possessions  their grass  and their sheep  and dawdling about
in a way not endurable to a third person  or driving out in a gig 
lately added to their establishment 

hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth
among the musgroves and their dependencies   it was unvarying 
warm admiration everywhere  but this intimate footing was not more
than established  when a certain charles hayter returned among them 
to be a good deal disturbed by it  and to think captain wentworth
very much in the way 

charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins  and a very amiable 
pleasing young man  between whom and henrietta there had been
a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth s
introduction   he was in orders  and having a curacy in the neighbourhood 
where residence was not required  lived at his father s house 
only two miles from uppercross   a short absence from home
had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period 
and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners 
and of seeing captain wentworth 

mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters   they had each had money 
but their marriages had made a material difference in
their degree of consequence   mr hayter had some property of his own 
but it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove s  and while
the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country 
the young hayters would  from their parents  inferior  retired 
and unpolished way of living  and their own defective education 
have been hardly in any class at all  but for their connexion
with uppercross  this eldest son of course excepted  who had chosen
to be a scholar and a gentleman  and who was very superior
in cultivation and manners to all the rest 

the two families had always been on excellent terms  there being no pride
on one side  and no envy on the other  and only such a consciousness
of superiority in the miss musgroves  as made them pleased
to improve their cousins   charles s attentions to henrietta
had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation 
 it would not be a great match for her  but if henrietta liked him    
and henrietta did seem to like him 

henrietta fully thought so herself  before captain wentworth came 
but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten 

which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was
as yet quite doubtful  as far as anne s observation reached 
henrietta was perhaps the prettiest  louisa had the higher spirits 
and she knew not now  whether the more gentle or the more lively character
were most likely to attract him 

mr and mrs musgrove  either from seeing little  or from
an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters 
and of all the young men who came near them  seemed to leave everything
to take its chance   there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude
or remark about them in the mansion house  but it was different
at the cottage   the young couple there were more disposed
to speculate and wonder  and captain wentworth had not been above
four or five times in the miss musgroves  company  and charles hayter
had but just reappeared  when anne had to listen to the opinions
of her brother and sister  as to which was the one liked best 
charles gave it for louisa  mary for henrietta  but quite agreeing
that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful 

charles  had never seen a pleasanter man in his life  and from what
he had once heard captain wentworth himself say  was very sure that
he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war 
here was a fortune at once  besides which  there would be the chance
of what might be done in any future war  and he was sure captain wentworth
was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy 
oh  it would be a capital match for either of his sisters  

 upon my word it would   replied mary    dear me   if he should
rise to any very great honours   if he should ever be made a baronet 
 lady wentworth  sounds very well   that would be a noble thing 
indeed  for henrietta   she would take place of me then  and henrietta
would not dislike that   sir frederick and lady wentworth 
it would be but a new creation  however  and i never think much
of your new creations  

it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred
on the very account of charles hayter  whose pretensions she wished
to see put an end to   she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters 
and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection
between the families renewed  very sad for herself and her children 

 you know   said she   i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta 
and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made 
she has no right to throw herself away   i do not think any young woman
has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient
to the principal part of her family  and be giving bad connections
to those who have not been used to them   and  pray  who is charles hayter 
nothing but a country curate   a most improper match for miss musgrove
of uppercross  

her husband  however  would not agree with her here  for besides having
a regard for his cousin  charles hayter was an eldest son 
and he saw things as an eldest son himself 

 now you are taking nonsense  mary   was therefore his answer 
 it would not be a great match for henrietta  but charles has
a very fair chance  through the spicers  of getting something from
the bishop in the course of a year or two  and you will please to remember 
that he is the eldest son  whenever my uncle dies  he steps into very
pretty property   the estate at winthrop is not less than
two hundred and fifty acres  besides the farm near taunton 
which is some of the best land in the country   i grant you 
that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta 
and indeed it could not be  he is the only one that could be possible 
but he is a very good natured  good sort of a fellow  and whenever winthrop
comes into his hands  he will make a different sort of place of it 
and live in a very different sort of way  and with that property 
he will never be a contemptible man  good  freehold property   no  no 
henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter  and if she has him 
and louisa can get captain wentworth  i shall be very well satisfied  

 charles may say what he pleases   cried mary to anne  as soon as
he was out of the room   but it would be shocking to have henrietta
marry charles hayter  a very bad thing for her  and still worse
for me  and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth
may soon put him quite out of her head  and i have very little doubt
that he has   she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday 
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour   and as to
captain wentworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta  it is nonsense
to say so  for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best 
but charles is so positive   i wish you had been with us yesterday 
for then you might have decided between us  and i am sure you
would have thought as i did  unless you had been determined
to give it against me  

a dinner at mr musgrove s had been the occasion when all these things
should have been seen by anne  but she had staid at home 
under the mixed plea of a headache of her own  and some return
of indisposition in little charles   she had thought only of avoiding
captain wentworth  but an escape from being appealed to as umpire
was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening 

as to captain wentworth s views  she deemed it of more consequence
that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering
the happiness of either sister  or impeaching his own honour 
than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa  or louisa to henrietta 
either of them would  in all probability  make him an affectionate 
good humoured wife   with regard to charles hayter  she had delicacy
which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well meaning
young woman  and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings
it occasioned  but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature
of her feelings  the alternation could not be understood too soon 

charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him
in his cousin s behaviour   she had too old a regard for him
to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish
every past hope  and leave him nothing to do but to keep away
from uppercross   but there was such a change as became very alarming 
when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as
the probable cause   he had been absent only two sundays 
and when they parted  had left her interested  even to the height
of his wishes  in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy 
and obtaining that of uppercross instead   it had then seemed the object
nearest her heart  that dr shirley  the rector  who for more than
forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office 
but was now growing too infirm for many of them  should be quite fixed
on engaging a curate  should make his curacy quite as good
as he could afford  and should give charles hayter the promise of it 
the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross  instead of going
six miles another way  of his having  in every respect  a better curacy 
of his belonging to their dear dr shirley  and of dear  good dr shirley s
being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through
without most injurious fatigue  had been a great deal  even to louisa 
but had been almost everything to henrietta   when he came back  alas 
the zeal of the business was gone by   louisa could not listen at all
to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley 
she was at a window  looking out for captain wentworth  and even henrietta
had at best only a divided attention to give  and seemed to have forgotten
all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation 

 well  i am very glad indeed   but i always thought you would have it 
i always thought you sure   it did not appear to me that  in short 
you know  dr shirley must have a curate  and you had secured his promise 
is he coming  louisa  

one morning  very soon after the dinner at the musgroves 
at which anne had not been present  captain wentworth walked into
the drawing room at the cottage  where were only herself and the little
invalid charles  who was lying on the sofa 

the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot 
deprived his manners of their usual composure   he started 
and could only say   i thought the miss musgroves had been here 
mrs musgrove told me i should find them here   before he walked
to the window to recollect himself  and feel how he ought to behave 

 they are up stairs with my sister   they will be down in a few moments 
i dare say   had been anne s reply  in all the confusion that was natural 
and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him 
she would have been out of the room the next moment  and released
captain wentworth as well as herself 

he continued at the window  and after calmly and politely saying 
 i hope the little boy is better   was silent 

she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa  and remain there
to satisfy her patient  and thus they continued a few minutes 
when  to her very great satisfaction  she heard some other person
crossing the little vestibule   she hoped  on turning her head 
to see the master of the house  but it proved to be one
much less calculated for making matters easy  charles hayter 
probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth
than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne 

she only attempted to say   how do you do   will you not sit down 
the others will be here presently  

captain wentworth  however  came from his window  apparently
not ill disposed for conversation  but charles hayter soon put an end
to his attempts by seating himself near the table  and taking up
the newspaper  and captain wentworth returned to his window 

another minute brought another addition   the younger boy 
a remarkable stout  forward child  of two years old  having got the door
opened for him by some one without  made his determined appearance
among them  and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on 
and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away 

there being nothing to eat  he could only have some play 
and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother 
he began to fasten himself upon her  as she knelt  in such a way that 
busy as she was about charles  she could not shake him off 
she spoke to him  ordered  entreated  and insisted in vain 
once she did contrive to push him away  but the boy had
the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly 

 walter   said she   get down this moment   you are extremely troublesome 
i am very angry with you  

 walter   cried charles hayter   why do you not do as you are bid 
do not you hear your aunt speak   come to me  walter  come to
cousin charles  

but not a bit did walter stir 

in another moment  however  she found herself in the state of
being released from him  some one was taking him from her 
though he had bent down her head so much  that his little sturdy hands
were unfastened from around her neck  and he was resolutely borne away 
before she knew that captain wentworth had done it 

her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless 
she could not even thank him   she could only hang over little charles 
with most disordered feelings   his kindness in stepping forward
to her relief  the manner  the silence in which it had passed 
the little particulars of the circumstance  with the conviction soon
forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child 
that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks  and rather sought
to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants 
produced such a confusion of varying  but very painful agitation 
as she could not recover from  till enabled by the entrance of mary
and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares 
and leave the room   she could not stay   it might have been
an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four  
they were now altogether  but she could stay for none of it 
it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards
captain wentworth   she had a strong impression of his having said 
in a vext tone of voice  after captain wentworth s interference 
 you ought to have minded me  walter  i told you not to teaze your aunt  
and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do
what he ought to have done himself   but neither charles hayter s feelings 
nor anybody s feelings  could interest her  till she had a little better
arranged her own   she was ashamed of herself  quite ashamed
of being so nervous  so overcome by such a trifle  but so it was 
and it required a long application of solitude and reflection
to recover her 



chapter 10


other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur 
anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough
to have an opinion  though too wise to acknowledge as much at home 
where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife 
for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite 
she could not but think  as far as she might dare to judge from memory
and experience  that captain wentworth was not in love with either 
they were more in love with him  yet there it was not love 
it was a little fever of admiration  but it might  probably must 
end in love with some   charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted 
and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them 
anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about 
and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to 
she did not attribute guile to any   it was the highest satisfaction
to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware
of the pain he was occasioning   there was no triumph  no pitiful triumph
in his manner   he had  probably  never heard  and never thought of
any claims of charles hayter   he was only wrong in accepting
the attentions  for accepting must be the word  of two young women at once 

after a short struggle  however  charles hayter seemed to quit the field 
three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross 
a most decided change   he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner 
and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books
before him  mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right 
and talked  with grave faces  of his studying himself to death 
it was mary s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal
from henrietta  and her husband lived under the constant dependence
of seeing him to morrow   anne could only feel that charles hayter
was wise 

one morning  about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth
being gone a shooting together  as the sisters in the cottage
were sitting quietly at work  they were visited at the window
by the sisters from the mansion house 

it was a very fine november day  and the miss musgroves came
through the little grounds  and stopped for no other purpose than to say 
that they were going to take a long walk  and therefore concluded
mary could not like to go with them  and when mary immediately replied 
with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker   oh  yes 
i should like to join you very much  i am very fond of a long walk  
anne felt persuaded  by the looks of the two girls  that it was precisely
what they did not wish  and admired again the sort of necessity
which the family habits seemed to produce  of everything being
to be communicated  and everything being to be done together 
however undesired and inconvenient   she tried to dissuade mary from going 
but in vain  and that being the case  thought it best to accept
the miss musgroves  much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise 
as she might be useful in turning back with her sister  and lessening
the interference in any plan of their own 

 i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk  
said mary  as she went up stairs    everybody is always supposing
that i am not a good walker  and yet they would not have been pleased 
if we had refused to join them   when people come in this manner
on purpose to ask us  how can one say no  

just as they were setting off  the gentlemen returned   they had taken out
a young dog  who had spoilt their sport  and sent them back early 
their time and strength  and spirits  were  therefore  exactly ready
for this walk  and they entered into it with pleasure   could anne
have foreseen such a junction  she would have staid at home  but 
from some feelings of interest and curiosity  she fancied now that it was
too late to retract  and the whole six set forward together
in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves  who evidently
considered the walk as under their guidance 

anne s object was  not to be in the way of anybody  and where
the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary 
to keep with her brother and sister   her pleasure in the walk
must arise from the exercise and the day  from the view of
the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves  and withered hedges 
and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical
descriptions extant of autumn  that season of peculiar and
inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness 
that season which had drawn from every poet  worthy of being read 
some attempt at description  or some lines of feeling 
she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings
and quotations  but it was not possible  that when within reach
of captain wentworth s conversation with either of the miss musgroves 
she should not try to hear it  yet she caught little very remarkable 
it was mere lively chat  such as any young persons  on an intimate footing 
might fall into   he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta 
louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister 
this distinction appeared to increase  and there was one speech
of louisa s which struck her   after one of the many praises of the day 
which were continually bursting forth  captain wentworth added    

 what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister   they meant to take
a long drive this morning  perhaps we may hail them from
some of these hills   they talked of coming into this side of the country 
i wonder whereabouts they will upset to day   oh  it does happen
very often  i assure you  but my sister makes nothing of it 
she would as lieve be tossed out as not  

 ah  you make the most of it  i know   cried louisa   but if it were
really so  i should do just the same in her place   if i loved a man 
as she loves the admiral  i would always be with him  nothing should ever
separate us  and i would rather be overturned by him  than driven safely
by anybody else  

it was spoken with enthusiasm 

 had you   cried he  catching the same tone   i honour you  
and there was silence between them for a little while 

anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again   the sweet scenes
of autumn were for a while put by  unless some tender sonnet 
fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year  with declining
happiness  and the images of youth and hope  and spring  all gone together 
blessed her memory   she roused herself to say  as they struck by order
into another path   is not this one of the ways to winthrop  
but nobody heard  or  at least  nobody answered her 

winthrop  however  or its environs  for young men are  sometimes
to be met with  strolling about near home  was their destination 
and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures 
where the ploughs at work  and the fresh made path spoke the farmer
counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence  and meaning
to have spring again  they gained the summit of the most considerable hill 
which parted uppercross and winthrop  and soon commanded a full view
of the latter  at the foot of the hill on the other side 

winthrop  without beauty and without dignity  was stretched before them
an indifferent house  standing low  and hemmed in by the barns and
buildings of a farm yard 

mary exclaimed   bless me  here is winthrop   i declare i had no idea 
well now  i think we had better turn back  i am excessively tired  

henrietta  conscious and ashamed  and seeing no cousin charles
walking along any path  or leaning against any gate  was ready
to do as mary wished  but  no   said charles musgrove  and  no  no  
cried louisa more eagerly  and taking her sister aside  seemed to be
arguing the matter warmly 

charles  in the meanwhile  was very decidedly declaring his resolution
of calling on his aunt  now that he was so near  and very evidently 
though more fearfully  trying to induce his wife to go too 
but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength 
and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter
of an hour at winthrop  as she felt so tired  she resolutely answered 
 oh  no  indeed  walking up that hill again would do her more harm
than any sitting down could do her good   and  in short 
her look and manner declared  that go she would not 

after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations 
it was settled between charles and his two sisters  that he
and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes  to see their aunt
and cousins  while the rest of the party waited for them at the top
of the hill   louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan 
and  as she went a little way with them  down the hill  still talking
to henrietta  mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her 
and saying to captain wentworth  

 it is very unpleasant  having such connexions   but  i assure you 
i have never been in the house above twice in my life  

she received no other answer  than an artificial  assenting smile 
followed by a contemptuous glance  as he turned away  which anne
perfectly knew the meaning of 

the brow of the hill  where they remained  was a cheerful spot 
louisa returned  and mary  finding a comfortable seat for herself
on the step of a stile  was very well satisfied so long as the others
all stood about her  but when louisa drew captain wentworth away 
to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge row 
and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound 
mary was happy no longer  she quarrelled with her own seat 
was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere  and nothing could
prevent her from going to look for a better also   she turned through
the same gate  but could not see them   anne found a nice seat
for her  on a dry sunny bank  under the hedge row  in which
she had no doubt of their still being  in some spot or other 
mary sat down for a moment  but it would not do  she was sure louisa
had found a better seat somewhere else  and she would go on
till she overtook her 

anne  really tired herself  was glad to sit down  and she very soon heard
captain wentworth and louisa in the hedge row  behind her  as if
making their way back along the rough  wild sort of channel  down the
centre   they were speaking as they drew near   louisa s voice was
the first distinguished   she seemed to be in the middle of some
eager speech   what anne first heard was  

 and so  i made her go   i could not bear that she should be frightened
from the visit by such nonsense   what  would i be turned back from
doing a thing that i had determined to do  and that i knew to be right 
by the airs and interference of such a person  or of any person i may say 
no  i have no idea of being so easily persuaded   when i have
made up my mind  i have made it  and henrietta seemed entirely
to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day  and yet  she was as near
giving it up  out of nonsensical complaisance  

 she would have turned back then  but for you  

 she would indeed   i am almost ashamed to say it  

 happy for her  to have such a mind as yours at hand   after the hints
you gave just now  which did but confirm my own observations 
the last time i was in company with him   i need not affect
to have no comprehension of what is going on   i see that more than
a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question 
and woe betide him  and her too  when it comes to things of consequence 
when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and
strength of mind  if she have not resolution enough to resist
idle interference in such a trifle as this   your sister is
an amiable creature  but yours is the character of decision and firmness 
i see   if you value her conduct or happiness  infuse as much
of your own spirit into her as you can   but this  no doubt 
you have been always doing   it is the worst evil of too yielding
and indecisive a character  that no influence over it can be depended on 
you are never sure of a good impression being durable  everybody
may sway it   let those who would be happy be firm   here is a nut  
said he  catching one down from an upper bough    to exemplify 
a beautiful glossy nut  which  blessed with original strength 
has outlived all the storms of autumn   not a puncture  not
a weak spot anywhere   this nut   he continued  with playful solemnity 
 while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot 
is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be
supposed capable of    then returning to his former earnest tone  
 my first wish for all whom i am interested in  is that they should be firm 
if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life 
she will cherish all her present powers of mind  

he had done  and was unanswered   it would have surprised anne if louisa
could have readily answered such a speech   words of such interest 
spoken with such serious warmth   she could imagine what louisa was feeling 
for herself  she feared to move  lest she should be seen 
while she remained  a bush of low rambling holly protected her 
and they were moving on   before they were beyond her hearing 
however  louisa spoke again 

 mary is good natured enough in many respects   said she 
 but she does sometimes provoke me excessively  by her nonsense
and pride  the elliot pride   she has a great deal too much
of the elliot pride   we do so wish that charles had married anne instead 
i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne  

after a moment s pause  captain wentworth said  

 do you mean that she refused him  

 oh  yes  certainly  

 when did that happen  

 i do not exactly know  for henrietta and i were at school at the time 
but i believe about a year before he married mary   i wish she had
accepted him   we should all have liked her a great deal better 
and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend
lady russell s doing  that she did not   they think charles
might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell 
and that therefore  she persuaded anne to refuse him  

the sounds were retreating  and anne distinguished no more 
her own emotions still kept her fixed   she had much to recover from 
before she could move   the listener s proverbial fate was
not absolutely hers  she had heard no evil of herself  but she had heard
a great deal of very painful import   she saw how her own character
was considered by captain wentworth  and there had been just that degree
of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her
extreme agitation 

as soon as she could  she went after mary  and having found 
and walked back with her to their former station  by the stile 
felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards
collected  and once more in motion together   her spirits wanted
the solitude and silence which only numbers could give 

charles and henrietta returned  bringing  as may be conjectured 
charles hayter with them   the minutiae of the business anne
could not attempt to understand  even captain wentworth did not seem
admitted to perfect confidence here  but that there had been a withdrawing
on the gentleman s side  and a relenting on the lady s  and that they
were now very glad to be together again  did not admit a doubt 
henrietta looked a little ashamed  but very well pleased   
charles hayter exceedingly happy   and they were devoted to each other
almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross 

everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth 
nothing could be plainer  and where many divisions were necessary 
or even where they were not  they walked side by side nearly as much
as the other two   in a long strip of meadow land  where there was
ample space for all  they were thus divided  forming three distinct parties 
and to that party of the three which boasted least animation 
and least complaisance  anne necessarily belonged   she joined charles
and mary  and was tired enough to be very glad of charles s other arm 
but charles  though in very good humour with her  was out of temper
with his wife   mary had shewn herself disobliging to him 
and was now to reap the consequence  which consequence was
his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads
of some nettles in the hedge with his switch  and when mary began
to complain of it  and lament her being ill used  according to custom 
in being on the hedge side  while anne was never incommoded on the other 
he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had
a momentary glance of  and they could hardly get him along at all 

this long meadow bordered a lane  which their footpath  at the end of it
was to cross  and when the party had all reached the gate of exit 
the carriage advancing in the same direction  which had been
some time heard  was just coming up  and proved to be admiral croft s gig 
he and his wife had taken their intended drive  and were returning home 
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in 
they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired 
it would save her a full mile  and they were going through uppercross 
the invitation was general  and generally declined   the miss musgroves
were not at all tired  and mary was either offended  by not being asked
before any of the others  or what louisa called the elliot pride
could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise 

the walking party had crossed the lane  and were surmounting an
opposite stile  and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again 
when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something
to his sister   the something might be guessed by its effects 

 miss elliot  i am sure you are tired   cried mrs croft 
 do let us have the pleasure of taking you home   here is excellent room
for three  i assure you   if we were all like you  i believe we might
sit four   you must  indeed  you must  

anne was still in the lane  and though instinctively beginning to decline 
she was not allowed to proceed   the admiral s kind urgency
came in support of his wife s  they would not be refused 
they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space
to leave her a corner  and captain wentworth  without saying a word 
turned to her  and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage 

yes  he had done it   she was in the carriage  and felt that he had
placed her there  that his will and his hands had done it 
that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue  and his resolution
to give her rest   she was very much affected by the view of
his disposition towards her  which all these things made apparent 
this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before 
she understood him   he could not forgive her  but he could not
be unfeeling   though condemning her for the past  and considering it
with high and unjust resentment  though perfectly careless of her 
and though becoming attached to another  still he could not see her suffer 
without the desire of giving her relief   it was a remainder
of former sentiment  it was an impulse of pure  though unacknowledged
friendship  it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart 
which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded
of pleasure and pain  that she knew not which prevailed 

her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions
were at first unconsciously given   they had travelled half their way
along the rough lane  before she was quite awake to what they said 
she then found them talking of  frederick  

 he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls  sophy  
said the admiral   but there is no saying which   he has been
running after them  too  long enough  one would think  to make up his mind 
ay  this comes of the peace   if it were war now  he would have
settled it long ago   we sailors  miss elliot  cannot afford to make
long courtships in time of war   how many days was it  my dear 
between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together
in our lodgings at north yarmouth  

 we had better not talk about it  my dear   replied mrs croft  pleasantly 
 for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding 
she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together 
i had known you by character  however  long before  

 well  and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl  and what were we
to wait for besides   i do not like having such things so long in hand 
i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass  and bring us home
one of these young ladies to kellynch   then there would always
be company for them   and very nice young ladies they both are 
i hardly know one from the other  

 very good humoured  unaffected girls  indeed   said mrs croft 
in a tone of calmer praise  such as made anne suspect that
her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy
of her brother   and a very respectable family   one could not be
connected with better people   my dear admiral  that post 
we shall certainly take that post  

but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily
passed the danger  and by once afterwards judiciously putting out
her hand they neither fell into a rut  nor ran foul of a dung cart 
and anne  with some amusement at their style of driving 
which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance
of their affairs  found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage 



chapter 11


the time now approached for lady russell s return   the day was even fixed 
and anne  being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled 
was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch  and beginning
to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it 

it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth 
within half a mile of him  they would have to frequent the same church 
and there must be intercourse between the two families 
this was against her  but on the other hand  he spent so much of his time
at uppercross  that in removing thence she might be considered rather
as leaving him behind  than as going towards him  and  upon the whole 
she believed she must  on this interesting question  be the gainer 
almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society 
in leaving poor mary for lady russell 

she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing
captain wentworth at the hall   those rooms had witnessed
former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her 
but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and
captain wentworth never meeting anywhere   they did not like each other 
and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good  and were lady russell
to see them together  she might think that he had too much self possession 
and she too little 

these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating
her removal from uppercross  where she felt she had been stationed
quite long enough   her usefulness to little charles would always
give some sweetness to the memory of her two months  visit there 
but he was gaining strength apace  and she had nothing else to stay for 

the conclusion of her visit  however  was diversified in a way
which she had not at all imagined   captain wentworth  after being unseen
and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days  appeared again among them
to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away 

a letter from his friend  captain harville  having found him out at last 
had brought intelligence of captain harville s being settled
with his family at lyme for the winter  of their being therefore 
quite unknowingly  within twenty miles of each other   captain harville
had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received
two years before  and captain wentworth s anxiety to see him
had determined him to go immediately to lyme   he had been there
for four and twenty hours   his acquittal was complete 
his friendship warmly honoured  a lively interest excited for his friend 
and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to
by the party  that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves 
and a project for going thither was the consequence 

the young people were all wild to see lyme   captain wentworth talked
of going there again himself  it was only seventeen miles from uppercross 
though november  the weather was by no means bad  and  in short 
louisa  who was the most eager of the eager  having formed
the resolution to go  and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked 
being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way 
bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off
till summer  and to lyme they were to go  charles  mary  anne  henrietta 
louisa  and captain wentworth 

the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night 
but to this mr musgrove  for the sake of his horses  would not consent 
and when it came to be rationally considered  a day in
the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place 
after deducting seven hours  as the nature of the country required 
for going and returning   they were  consequently  to stay the night there 
and not to be expected back till the next day s dinner   this was felt
to be a considerable amendment  and though they all met at the great house
at rather an early breakfast hour  and set off very punctually 
it was so much past noon before the two carriages  mr musgrove s coach
containing the four ladies  and charles s curricle  in which
he drove captain wentworth  were descending the long hill into lyme 
and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself 
that it was very evident they would not have more than time
for looking about them  before the light and warmth of the day were gone 

after securing accommodations  and ordering a dinner at one of the inns 
the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly
down to the sea   they were come too late in the year for any amusement
or variety which lyme  as a public place  might offer   the rooms
were shut up  the lodgers almost all gone  scarcely any family
but of the residents left  and  as there is nothing to admire
in the buildings themselves  the remarkable situation of the town 
the principal street almost hurrying into the water  the walk to the cobb 
skirting round the pleasant little bay  which  in the season 
is animated with bathing machines and company  the cobb itself 
its old wonders and new improvements  with the very beautiful
line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town  are what
the stranger s eye will seek  and a very strange stranger it must be 
who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme 
to make him wish to know it better   the scenes in its neighbourhood 
charmouth  with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country 
and still more  its sweet  retired bay  backed by dark cliffs 
where fragments of low rock among the sands  make it the happiest spot
for watching the flow of the tide  for sitting in unwearied contemplation 
the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme  and  above all 
pinny  with its green chasms between romantic rocks  where
the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth 
declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first
partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state 
where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited  as may
more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far famed
isle of wight   these places must be visited  and visited again 
to make the worth of lyme understood 

the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted
and melancholy looking rooms  and still descending  soon found themselves
on the sea shore  and lingering only  as all must linger and gaze
on a first return to the sea  who ever deserved to look on it at all 
proceeded towards the cobb  equally their object in itself
and on captain wentworth s account   for in a small house 
near the foot of an old pier of unknown date  were the harvilles settled 
captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend  the others walked on 
and he was to join them on the cobb 

they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring  and not even louisa
seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long 
when they saw him coming after them  with three companions 
all well known already  by description  to be captain and mrs harville 
and a captain benwick  who was staying with them 

captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia 
and the account which captain wentworth had given of him 
on his return from lyme before  his warm praise of him as
an excellent young man and an officer  whom he had always valued highly 
which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener 
had been followed by a little history of his private life 
which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies 
he had been engaged to captain harville s sister  and was now
mourning her loss   they had been a year or two waiting for fortune
and promotion   fortune came  his prize money as lieutenant being great 
promotion  too  came at last  but fanny harville did not live to know it 
she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea   captain wentworth
believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman
than poor benwick had been to fanny harville  or to be more deeply
afflicted under the dreadful change   he considered his disposition
as of the sort which must suffer heavily  uniting very strong feelings
with quiet  serious  and retiring manners  and a decided taste for reading 
and sedentary pursuits   to finish the interest of the story 
the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed  if possible 
augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance 
and captain benwick was now living with them entirely   captain harville
had taken his present house for half a year  his taste  and his health 
and his fortune  all directing him to a residence inexpensive 
and by the sea  and the grandeur of the country  and the retirement
of lyme in the winter  appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick s
state of mind   the sympathy and good will excited towards captain benwick
was very great 

 and yet   said anne to herself  as they now moved forward
to meet the party   he has not  perhaps  a more sorrowing heart
than i have   i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever 
he is younger than i am  younger in feeling  if not in fact 
younger as a man   he will rally again  and be happy with another  

they all met  and were introduced   captain harville was a tall 
dark man  with a sensible  benevolent countenance  a little lame 
and from strong features and want of health  looking much older
than captain wentworth   captain benwick looked  and was 
the youngest of the three  and  compared with either of them 
a little man   he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air 
just as he ought to have  and drew back from conversation 

captain harville  though not equalling captain wentworth in manners 
was a perfect gentleman  unaffected  warm  and obliging 
mrs harville  a degree less polished than her husband  seemed  however 
to have the same good feelings  and nothing could be more pleasant
than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own 
because the friends of captain wentworth  or more kindly hospitable
than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them 
the dinner  already ordered at the inn  was at last  though unwillingly 
accepted as a excuse  but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth
should have brought any such party to lyme  without considering it
as a thing of course that they should dine with them 

there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this 
and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon 
so unlike the usual style of give and take invitations  and dinners
of formality and display  that anne felt her spirits not likely to be
benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother officers 
 these would have been all my friends   was her thought 
and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness 

on quitting the cobb  they all went in doors with their new friends 
and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart
could think capable of accommodating so many   anne had
a moment s astonishment on the subject herself  but it was soon lost
in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all
the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville 
to turn the actual space to the best account  to supply the deficiencies
of lodging house furniture  and defend the windows and doors
against the winter storms to be expected   the varieties in
the fitting up of the rooms  where the common necessaries
provided by the owner  in the common indifferent plight 
were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood 
excellently worked up  and with something curious and valuable
from all the distant countries captain harville had visited 
were more than amusing to anne  connected as it all was with his profession 
the fruit of its labours  the effect of its influence on his habits 
the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented 
made it to her a something more  or less  than gratification 

captain harville was no reader  but he had contrived
excellent accommodations  and fashioned very pretty shelves 
for a tolerable collection of well bound volumes  the property of
captain benwick   his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise 
but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with
constant employment within   he drew  he varnished  he carpentered 
he glued  he made toys for the children  he fashioned new netting needles
and pins with improvements  and if everything else was done 
sat down to his large fishing net at one corner of the room 

anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they
quitted the house  and louisa  by whom she found herself walking 
burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character
of the navy  their friendliness  their brotherliness  their openness 
their uprightness  protesting that she was convinced of sailors having
more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england 
that they only knew how to live  and they only deserved to be
respected and loved 

they went back to dress and dine  and so well had the scheme
answered already  that nothing was found amiss  though its being
 so entirely out of season   and the  no thoroughfare of lyme  
and the  no expectation of company   had brought many apologies
from the heads of the inn 

anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened
to being in captain wentworth s company than she had at first imagined
could ever be  that the sitting down to the same table with him now 
and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it
 they never got beyond   was become a mere nothing 

the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow 
but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening 
and he came  bringing his friend also  which was more than
had been expected  it having been agreed that captain benwick
had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of
so many strangers   he ventured among them again  however 
though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth
of the party in general 

while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room 
and by recurring to former days  supplied anecdotes in abundance
to occupy and entertain the others  it fell to anne s lot to be placed
rather apart with captain benwick  and a very good impulse
of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him 
he was shy  and disposed to abstraction  but the engaging mildness of
her countenance  and gentleness of her manners  soon had their effect 
and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion 
he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading 
though principally in poetry  and besides the persuasion of having
given him at least an evening s indulgence in the discussion of subjects 
which his usual companions had probably no concern in  she had the hope
of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and
benefit of struggling against affliction  which had naturally grown out
of their conversation   for  though shy  he did not seem reserved 
it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their
usual restraints  and having talked of poetry  the richness of
the present age  and gone through a brief comparison of opinion
as to the first rate poets  trying to ascertain whether marmion
or the lady of the lake were to be preferred  and how ranked the giaour
and the bride of abydos  and moreover  how the giaour was to be pronounced 
he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs
of the one poet  and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony
of the other  he repeated  with such tremulous feeling  the various lines
which imaged a broken heart  or a mind destroyed by wretchedness 
and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood 
that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry 
and to say  that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be
seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely 
and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly
were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly 

his looks shewing him not pained  but pleased with this allusion
to his situation  she was emboldened to go on  and feeling in herself
the right of seniority of mind  she ventured to recommend
a larger allowance of prose in his daily study  and on being requested
to particularize  mentioned such works of our best moralists 
such collections of the finest letters  such memoirs of characters
of worth and suffering  as occurred to her at the moment
as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts 
and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances 

captain benwick listened attentively  and seemed grateful for
the interest implied  and though with a shake of the head 
and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books
on grief like his  noted down the names of those she recommended 
and promised to procure and read them 

when the evening was over  anne could not but be amused at the idea
of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man
whom she had never seen before  nor could she help fearing 
on more serious reflection  that  like many other great moralists
and preachers  she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct
would ill bear examination 



chapter 12


anne and henrietta  finding themselves the earliest of the party
the next morning  agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast 
they went to the sands  to watch the flowing of the tide 
which a fine south easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur
which so flat a shore admitted   they praised the morning 
gloried in the sea  sympathized in the delight of the fresh feeling
breeze  and were silent  till henrietta suddenly began again with  

 oh  yes   i am quite convinced that  with very few exceptions 
the sea air always does good   there can be no doubt of its having been
of the greatest service to dr shirley  after his illness 
last spring twelve month   he declares himself  that coming to lyme
for a month  did him more good than all the medicine he took 
and  that being by the sea  always makes him feel young again 
now  i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live
entirely by the sea   i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely 
and fix at lyme   do not you  anne   do not you agree with me 
that it is the best thing he could do  both for himself and mrs shirley 
she has cousins here  you know  and many acquaintance  which would
make it cheerful for her  and i am sure she would be glad
to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand 
in case of his having another seizure   indeed i think it quite melancholy
to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley  who have been
doing good all their lives  wearing out their last days in a place
like uppercross  where  excepting our family  they seem shut out
from all the world   i wish his friends would propose it to him 
i really think they ought   and  as to procuring a dispensation 
there could be no difficulty at his time of life  and with his character 
my only doubt is  whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish 
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions  over scrupulous
i must say   do not you think  anne  it is being over scrupulous 
do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience 
when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties 
which may be just as well performed by another person   and at lyme too 
only seventeen miles off  he would be near enough to hear 
if people thought there was anything to complain of  

anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech 
and entered into the subject  as ready to do good by entering into
the feelings of a young lady as of a young man  though here it was good
of a lower standard  for what could be offered but general acquiescence 
she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business 
felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought  saw how very
desirable it was that he should have some active  respectable young man 
as a resident curate  and was even courteous enough to hint at
the advantage of such resident curate s being married 

 i wish   said henrietta  very well pleased with her companion 
 i wish lady russell lived at uppercross  and were intimate
with dr shirley   i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of
the greatest influence with everybody   i always look upon her as able
to persuade a person to anything   i am afraid of her  as i have
told you before  quite afraid of her  because she is so very clever 
but i respect her amazingly  and wish we had such a neighbour
at uppercross  

anne was amused by henrietta s manner of being grateful 
and amused also that the course of events and the new interests
of henrietta s views should have placed her friend at all in favour
with any of the musgrove family  she had only time  however 
for a general answer  and a wish that such another woman
were at uppercross  before all subjects suddenly ceased 
on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them 
they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready 
but louisa recollecting  immediately afterwards that she had something
to procure at a shop  invited them all to go back with her into the town 
they were all at her disposal 

when they came to the steps  leading upwards from the beach  a gentleman 
at the same moment preparing to come down  politely drew back 
and stopped to give them way   they ascended and passed him 
and as they passed  anne s face caught his eye  and he looked at her
with a degree of earnest admiration  which she could not be insensible of 
she was looking remarkably well  her very regular  very pretty features 
having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind
which had been blowing on her complexion  and by the animation of eye
which it had also produced   it was evident that the gentleman 
 completely a gentleman in manner  admired her exceedingly 
captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which
shewed his noticing of it   he gave her a momentary glance 
a glance of brightness  which seemed to say   that man is struck with you 
and even i  at this moment  see something like anne elliot again  

after attending louisa through her business  and loitering about
a little longer  they returned to the inn  and anne  in passing afterwards
quickly from her own chamber to their dining room  had nearly run against
the very same gentleman  as he came out of an adjoining apartment 
she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves 
and determined that a well looking groom  who was strolling about
near the two inns as they came back  should be his servant 
both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea 
it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves 
and this second meeting  short as it was  also proved again
by the gentleman s looks  that he thought hers very lovely 
and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies  that he was
a man of exceedingly good manners   he seemed about thirty 
and though not handsome  had an agreeable person   anne felt that
she should like to know who he was 

they had nearly done breakfast  when the sound of a carriage 
 almost the first they had heard since entering lyme  drew half the party
to the window   it was a gentleman s carriage  a curricle 
but only coming round from the stable yard to the front door 
somebody must be going away   it was driven by a servant in mourning 

the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might
compare it with his own  the servant in mourning roused anne s curiosity 
and the whole six were collected to look  by the time the owner
of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows
and civilities of the household  and taking his seat  to drive off 

 ah   cried captain wentworth  instantly  and with half a glance at anne 
 it is the very man we passed  

the miss musgroves agreed to it  and having all kindly watched him
as far up the hill as they could  they returned to the breakfast table 
the waiter came into the room soon afterwards 

 pray   said captain wentworth  immediately   can you tell us the name
of the gentleman who is just gone away  

 yes  sir  a mr elliot  a gentleman of large fortune  came in last night
from sidmouth   dare say you heard the carriage  sir  while you were
at dinner  and going on now for crewkherne  in his way to bath
and london  

 elliot    many had looked on each other  and many had repeated the name 
before all this had been got through  even by the smart rapidity
of a waiter 

 bless me   cried mary   it must be our cousin  it must be our mr elliot 
it must  indeed   charles  anne  must not it   in mourning  you see 
just as our mr elliot must be   how very extraordinary 
in the very same inn with us   anne  must not it be our mr elliot 
my father s next heir   pray sir   turning to the waiter 
 did not you hear  did not his servant say whether he belonged
to the kellynch family  

 no  ma am  he did not mention no particular family  but he said
his master was a very rich gentleman  and would be a baronight some day  

 there  you see   cried mary in an ecstasy   just as i said 
heir to sir walter elliot   i was sure that would come out 
if it was so   depend upon it  that is a circumstance which his servants
take care to publish  wherever he goes   but  anne  only conceive
how extraordinary   i wish i had looked at him more   i wish we had
been aware in time  who it was  that he might have been introduced to us 
what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other 
do you think he had the elliot countenance   i hardly looked at him 
i was looking at the horses  but i think he had something
of the elliot countenance  i wonder the arms did not strike me 
oh  the great coat was hanging over the panel  and hid the arms 
so it did  otherwise  i am sure  i should have observed them 
and the livery too  if the servant had not been in mourning 
one should have known him by the livery  

 putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together  
said captain wentworth   we must consider it to be the arrangement
of providence  that you should not be introduced to your cousin  

when she could command mary s attention  anne quietly tried
to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not  for many years 
been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction
at all desirable 

at the same time  however  it was a secret gratification to herself
to have seen her cousin  and to know that the future owner of kellynch
was undoubtedly a gentleman  and had an air of good sense 
she would not  upon any account  mention her having met with him
the second time  luckily mary did not much attend to their having
passed close by him in their earlier walk  but she would have felt
quite ill used by anne s having actually run against him in the passage 
and received his very polite excuses  while she had never been
near him at all  no  that cousinly little interview must remain
a perfect secret 

 of course   said mary   you will mention our seeing mr elliot 
the next time you write to bath   i think my father certainly
ought to hear of it  do mention all about him  

anne avoided a direct reply  but it was just the circumstance
which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated 
but as what ought to be suppressed   the offence which had been given
her father  many years back  she knew  elizabeth s particular share in it
she suspected  and that mr elliot s idea always produced irritation in both
was beyond a doubt   mary never wrote to bath herself  all the toil
of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth
fell on anne 

breakfast had not been long over  when they were joined by captain
and mrs harville and captain benwick  with whom they had appointed
to take their last walk about lyme   they ought to be setting off
for uppercross by one  and in the mean while were to be all together 
and out of doors as long as they could 

anne found captain benwick getting near her  as soon as they were all
fairly in the street   their conversation the preceding evening
did not disincline him to seek her again  and they walked together
some time  talking as before of mr scott and lord byron 
and still as unable as before  and as unable as any other two readers 
to think exactly alike of the merits of either  till something
occasioned an almost general change amongst their party  and instead of
captain benwick  she had captain harville by her side 

 miss elliot   said he  speaking rather low   you have done a good deed
in making that poor fellow talk so much   i wish he could have
such company oftener   it is bad for him  i know  to be shut up as he is 
but what can we do   we cannot part  

 no   said anne   that i can easily believe to be impossible 
but in time  perhaps  we know what time does in every case of affliction 
and you must remember  captain harville  that your friend
may yet be called a young mourner  only last summer  i understand  

 ay  true enough    with a deep sigh   only june  

 and not known to him  perhaps  so soon  

 not till the first week of august  when he came home from the cape 
just made into the grappler   i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him 
he sent in letters  but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth 
there the news must follow him  but who was to tell it  not i 
i would as soon have been run up to the yard arm   nobody could do it 
but that good fellow   pointing to captain wentworth     the laconia
had come into plymouth the week before  no danger of her
being sent to sea again   he stood his chance for the rest 
wrote up for leave of absence  but without waiting the return 
travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth  rowed off
to the grappler that instant  and never left the poor fellow for a week 
that s what he did  and nobody else could have saved poor james 
you may think  miss elliot  whether he is dear to us  

anne did think on the question with perfect decision  and said as much
in reply as her own feeling could accomplish  or as his seemed
able to bear  for he was too much affected to renew the subject 
and when he spoke again  it was of something totally different 

mrs harville s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have
quite walking enough by the time he reached home  determined the direction
of all the party in what was to be their last walk  they would
accompany them to their door  and then return and set off themselves 
by all their calculations there was just time for this  but as they drew
near the cobb  there was such a general wish to walk along it once more 
all were so inclined  and louisa soon grew so determined 
that the difference of a quarter of an hour  it was found 
would be no difference at all  so with all the kind leave taking 
and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which
may be imagined  they parted from captain and mrs harville
at their own door  and still accompanied by captain benwick 
who seemed to cling to them to the last  proceeded to make
the proper adieus to the cobb 

anne found captain benwick again drawing near her   lord byron s
 dark blue seas  could not fail of being brought forward by
their present view  and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as
attention was possible   it was soon drawn  perforce another way 

there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant
for the ladies  and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower 
and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight 
excepting louisa  she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth 
in all their walks  he had had to jump her from the stiles 
the sensation was delightful to her   the hardness of the pavement
for her feet  made him less willing upon the present occasion 
he did it  however   she was safely down  and instantly 
to show her enjoyment  ran up the steps to be jumped down again 
he advised her against it  thought the jar too great  but no 
he reasoned and talked in vain  she smiled and said   i am determined
i will   he put out his hands  she was too precipitate by half a second 
she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb  and was taken up lifeless 
there was no wound  no blood  no visible bruise  but her eyes were closed 
she breathed not  her face was like death   the horror of the moment
to all who stood around 

captain wentworth  who had caught her up  knelt with her in his arms 
looking on her with a face as pallid as her own  in an agony of silence 
 she is dead  she is dead   screamed mary  catching hold of her
husband  and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable 
and in another moment  henrietta  sinking under the conviction  lost
her senses too  and would have fallen on the steps  but for captain
benwick and anne  who caught and supported her between them 

 is there no one to help me   were the first words which
burst from captain wentworth  in a tone of despair  and as if
all his own strength were gone 

 go to him  go to him   cried anne   for heaven s sake go to him 
i can support her myself   leave me  and go to him   rub her hands 
rub her temples  here are salts  take them  take them  

captain benwick obeyed  and charles at the same moment 
disengaging himself from his wife  they were both with him 
and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them 
and everything was done that anne had prompted  but in vain 
while captain wentworth  staggering against the wall for his support 
exclaimed in the bitterest agony  

 oh god  her father and mother  

 a surgeon   said anne 

he caught the word  it seemed to rouse him at once  and saying only  
 true  true  a surgeon this instant   was darting away 
when anne eagerly suggested  

 captain benwick  would not it be better for captain benwick 
he knows where a surgeon is to be found  

every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea 
and in a moment  it was all done in rapid moments  captain benwick had
resigned the poor corpse like  figure entirely to the brother s care 
and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity 

as to the wretched party left behind  it could scarcely be said
which of the three  who were completely rational  was suffering most 
captain wentworth  anne  or charles  who  really a very affectionate
brother  hung over louisa with sobs of grief  and could only turn his eyes
from one sister  to see the other in a state as insensible 
or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife  calling on him
for help which he could not give 

anne  attending with all the strength and zeal  and thought 
which instinct supplied  to henrietta  still tried  at intervals 
to suggest comfort to the others  tried to quiet mary  to animate charles 
to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth   both seemed to look to her
for directions 

 anne  anne   cried charles   what is to be done next 
what  in heaven s name  is to be done next  

captain wentworth s eyes were also turned towards her 

 had not she better be carried to the inn   yes  i am sure 
carry her gently to the inn  

 yes  yes  to the inn   repeated captain wentworth  comparatively
collected  and eager to be doing something    i will carry her myself 
musgrove  take care of the others  

by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen
and boatmen about the cobb  and many were collected near them 
to be useful if wanted  at any rate  to enjoy the sight of
a dead young lady  nay  two dead young ladies  for it proved twice as fine
as the first report   to some of the best looking of these good people
henrietta was consigned  for  though partially revived 
she was quite helpless  and in this manner  anne walking by her side 
and charles attending to his wife  they set forward  treading back
with feelings unutterable  the ground  which so lately  so very lately 
and so light of heart  they had passed along 

they were not off the cobb  before the harvilles met them 
captain benwick had been seen flying by their house  with a countenance
which showed something to be wrong  and they had set off immediately 
informed and directed as they passed  towards the spot 
shocked as captain harville was  he brought senses and nerves
that could be instantly useful  and a look between him and his wife
decided what was to be done   she must be taken to their house 
all must go to their house  and await the surgeon s arrival there 
they would not listen to scruples   he was obeyed  they were all
beneath his roof  and while louisa  under mrs harville s direction 
was conveyed up stairs  and given possession of her own bed 
assistance  cordials  restoratives were supplied by her husband
to all who needed them 

louisa had once opened her eyes  but soon closed them again 
without apparent consciousness   this had been a proof of life 
however  of service to her sister  and henrietta  though perfectly
incapable of being in the same room with louisa  was kept 
by the agitation of hope and fear  from a return of her own insensibility 
mary  too  was growing calmer 

the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible 
they were sick with horror  while he examined  but he was not hopeless 
the head had received a severe contusion  but he had seen greater injuries
recovered from   he was by no means hopeless  he spoke cheerfully 

that he did not regard it as a desperate case  that he did not say
a few hours must end it  was at first felt  beyond the hope of most 
and the ecstasy of such a reprieve  the rejoicing  deep and silent 
after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered 
may be conceived 

the tone  the look  with which  thank god   was uttered
by captain wentworth  anne was sure could never be forgotten by her 
nor the sight of him afterwards  as he sat near a table  leaning over it
with folded arms and face concealed  as if overpowered by
the various feelings of his soul  and trying by prayer and reflection
to calm them 

louisa s limbs had escaped   there was no injury but to the head 

it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done 
as to their general situation   they were now able to speak to each other
and consult   that louisa must remain where she was  however distressing
to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble 
did not admit a doubt   her removal was impossible   the harvilles
silenced all scruples  and  as much as they could  all gratitude 
they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others
began to reflect   captain benwick must give up his room to them 
and get another bed elsewhere  and the whole was settled 
they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more 
and yet perhaps  by  putting the children away in the maid s room 
or swinging a cot somewhere   they could hardly bear to think of not
finding room for two or three besides  supposing they might wish to stay 
though  with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove  there need not be
the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville s care entirely 
mrs harville was a very experienced nurse  and her nursery maid 
who had lived with her long  and gone about with her everywhere 
was just such another   between these two  she could want
no possible attendance by day or night   and all this was said
with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible 

charles  henrietta  and captain wentworth were the three in consultation 
and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror 
 uppercross  the necessity of some one s going to uppercross 
the news to be conveyed  how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove 
the lateness of the morning  an hour already gone since they
ought to have been off  the impossibility of being in tolerable time  
at first  they were capable of nothing more to the purpose
than such exclamations  but  after a while  captain wentworth 
exerting himself  said  

 we must be decided  and without the loss of another minute 
every minute is valuable   some one must resolve on being off
for uppercross instantly   musgrove  either you or i must go  

charles agreed  but declared his resolution of not going away 
he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville 
but as to leaving his sister in such a state  he neither ought  nor would 
so far it was decided  and henrietta at first declared the same 
she  however  was soon persuaded to think differently   the usefulness
of her staying   she who had not been able to remain in louisa s room 
or to look at her  without sufferings which made her worse than helpless 
she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good 
yet was still unwilling to be away  till  touched by the thought
of her father and mother  she gave it up  she consented 
she was anxious to be at home 

the plan had reached this point  when anne  coming quietly
down from louisa s room  could not but hear what followed 
for the parlour door was open 

 then it is settled  musgrove   cried captain wentworth 
 that you stay  and that i take care of your sister home 
but as to the rest  as to the others  if one stays to assist mrs harville 
i think it need be only one   mrs charles musgrove will  of course 
wish to get back to her children  but if anne will stay  no one so proper 
so capable as anne  

she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself
so spoken of   the other two warmly agreed with what he said 
and she then appeared 

 you will stay  i am sure  you will stay and nurse her   cried he 
turning to her and speaking with a glow  and yet a gentleness 
which seemed almost restoring the past   she coloured deeply 
and he recollected himself and moved away   she expressed herself
most willing  ready  happy to remain    it was what she had been
thinking of  and wishing to be allowed to do   a bed on the floor
in louisa s room would be sufficient for her  if mrs harville
would but think so  

one thing more  and all seemed arranged   though it was rather desirable
that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some
share of delay  yet the time required by the uppercross horses
to take them back  would be a dreadful extension of suspense 
and captain wentworth proposed  and charles musgrove agreed 
that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn 
and leave mr musgrove s carriage and horses to be sent home
the next morning early  when there would be the farther advantage
of sending an account of louisa s night 

captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part 
and to be soon followed by the two ladies   when the plan was
made known to mary  however  there was an end of all peace in it 
she was so wretched and so vehement  complained so much of injustice
in being expected to go away instead of anne  anne  who was
nothing to louisa  while she was her sister  and had the best right
to stay in henrietta s stead   why was not she to be as useful as anne 
and to go home without charles  too  without her husband 
no  it was too unkind   and in short  she said more than her husband
could long withstand  and as none of the others could oppose
when he gave way  there was no help for it  the change of mary for anne
was inevitable 

anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous
and ill judging claims of mary  but so it must be  and they set off
for the town  charles taking care of his sister  and captain benwick
attending to her   she gave a moment s recollection  as they hurried along 
to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed
earlier in the morning   there she had listened to henrietta s schemes
for dr shirley s leaving uppercross  farther on  she had
first seen mr elliot  a moment seemed all that could now be given
to any one but louisa  or those who were wrapt up in her welfare 

captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her  and 
united as they all seemed by the distress of the day  she felt
an increasing degree of good will towards him  and a pleasure even
in thinking that it might  perhaps  be the occasion of continuing
their acquaintance 

captain wentworth was on the watch for them  and a chaise and four in waiting 
stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street 
but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister
for the other  the change in his countenance  the astonishment 
the expressions begun and suppressed  with which charles was listened to 
made but a mortifying reception of anne  or must at least convince her
that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa 

she endeavoured to be composed  and to be just   without emulating
the feelings of an emma towards her henry  she would have
attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard 
for his sake  and she hoped he would not long be so unjust
as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend 

in the mean while she was in the carriage   he had handed them both in 
and placed himself between them  and in this manner  under these
circumstances  full of astonishment and emotion to anne  she quitted lyme 
how the long stage would pass  how it was to affect their manners 
what was to be their sort of intercourse  she could not foresee 
it was all quite natural  however   he was devoted to henrietta 
always turning towards her  and when he spoke at all  always with the view
of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits   in general 
his voice and manner were studiously calm   to spare henrietta
from agitation seemed the governing principle   once only 
when she had been grieving over the last ill judged  ill fated
walk to the cobb  bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of 
he burst forth  as if wholly overcome  

 don t talk of it  don t talk of it   he cried    oh god  that i had
not given way to her at the fatal moment   had i done as i ought 
but so eager and so resolute  dear  sweet louisa  

anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now  to question the justness
of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage
of firmness of character  and whether it might not strike him that 
like all other qualities of the mind  it should have its proportions
and limits   she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel
that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness
as a very resolute character 

they got on fast   anne was astonished to recognise the same hills
and the same objects so soon   their actual speed  heightened by
some dread of the conclusion  made the road appear but half as long
as on the day before   it was growing quite dusk  however 
before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross  and there had been
total silence among them for some time  henrietta leaning back
in the corner  with a shawl over her face  giving the hope of her
having cried herself to sleep  when  as they were going up their last hill 
anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth 
in a low  cautious voice  he said    

 i have been considering what we had best do   she must not
appear at first   she could not stand it   i have been thinking whether
you had not better remain in the carriage with her  while i go in
and break it to mr and mrs musgrove   do you think this is a good plan  

she did   he was satisfied  and said no more   but the remembrance
of the appeal remained a pleasure to her  as a proof of friendship 
and of deference for her judgement  a great pleasure  and when it became
a sort of parting proof  its value did not lessen 

when the distressing communication at uppercross was over 
and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped 
and the daughter all the better for being with them  he announced
his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme 
and when the horses were baited  he was off

chapter 13


the remainder of anne s time at uppercross  comprehending only two days 
was spent entirely at the mansion house  and she had the satisfaction
of knowing herself extremely useful there  both as an immediate companion 
and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future  which 
in mr and mrs musgrove s distressed state of spirits  would have
been difficulties 

they had an early account from lyme the next morning   louisa was
much the same   no symptoms worse than before had appeared 
charles came a few hours afterwards  to bring a later and
more particular account   he was tolerably cheerful   a speedy cure
must not be hoped  but everything was going on as well
as the nature of the case admitted   in speaking of the harvilles 
he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness 
especially of mrs harville s exertions as a nurse    she really left
nothing for mary to do   he and mary had been persuaded to go early
to their inn last night   mary had been hysterical again this morning 
when he came away  she was going to walk out with captain benwick 
which  he hoped  would do her good   he almost wished she had been
prevailed on to come home the day before  but the truth was 
that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do  

charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon  and his father
had at first half a mind to go with him  but the ladies could not consent 
it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others 
and increase his own distress  and a much better scheme followed
and was acted upon   a chaise was sent for from crewkherne 
and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery maid
of the family  one who having brought up all the children 
and seen the very last  the lingering and long petted master harry 
sent to school after his brothers  was now living in her deserted nursery
to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could
get near her  and who  consequently  was only too happy in being
allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa   vague wishes of
getting sarah thither  had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta 
but without anne  it would hardly have been resolved on 
and found practicable so soon 

they were indebted  the next day  to charles hayter  for all
the minute knowledge of louisa  which it was so essential to obtain
every twenty four hours   he made it his business to go to lyme 
and his account was still encouraging   the intervals of sense
and consciousness were believed to be stronger   every report agreed
in captain wentworth s appearing fixed in lyme 

anne was to leave them on the morrow  an event which they all dreaded 
 what should they do without her   they were wretched comforters
for one another    and so much was said in this way  that anne thought
she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination
to which she was privy  and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once 
she had little difficulty  it was soon determined that they would go 
go to morrow  fix themselves at the inn  or get into lodgings 
as it suited  and there remain till dear louisa could be moved 
they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with 
they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children 
and in short  they were so happy in the decision  that anne was delighted
with what she had done  and felt that she could not spend her
last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations 
and sending them off at an early hour  though her being left
to the solitary range of the house was the consequence 

she was the last  excepting the little boys at the cottage 
she was the very last  the only remaining one of all that had filled
and animated both houses  of all that had given uppercross
its cheerful character   a few days had made a change indeed 

if louisa recovered  it would all be well again   more than
former happiness would be restored   there could not be a doubt 
to her mind there was none  of what would follow her recovery 
a few months hence  and the room now so deserted  occupied but by
her silent  pensive self  might be filled again with all that was happy
and gay  all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love 
all that was most unlike anne elliot 

an hour s complete leisure for such reflections as these 
on a dark november day  a small thick rain almost blotting out
the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows  was enough
to make the sound of lady russell s carriage exceedingly welcome 
and yet  though desirous to be gone  she could not quit the mansion house 
or look an adieu to the cottage  with its black  dripping and
comfortless veranda  or even notice through the misty glasses
the last humble tenements of the village  without a saddened heart 
scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious 
it stood the record of many sensations of pain  once severe 
but now softened  and of some instances of relenting feeling 
some breathings of friendship and reconciliation  which could
never be looked for again  and which could never cease to be dear 
she left it all behind her  all but the recollection that
such things had been 

anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell s house
in september   it had not been necessary  and the few occasions of
its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade
and escape from   her first return was to resume her place in the modern
and elegant apartments of the lodge  and to gladden the eyes
of its mistress 

there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell s joy in meeting her 
she knew who had been frequenting uppercross   but happily 
either anne was improved in plumpness and looks  or lady russell
fancied her so  and anne  in receiving her compliments on the occasion 
had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration
of her cousin  and of hoping that she was to be blessed with
a second spring of youth and beauty 

when they came to converse  she was soon sensible of some mental change 
the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch 
and which she had felt slighted  and been compelled to smother
among the musgroves  were now become but of secondary interest 
she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath 
their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross 
and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears 
and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place 
which had been taken  and her regret that mrs clay should still
be with them  anne would have been ashamed to have it known
how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove 
and all her acquaintance there  how much more interesting to her
was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick 
than her own father s house in camden place  or her own sister s intimacy
with mrs clay   she was actually forced to exert herself
to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude 
on topics which had by nature the first claim on her 

there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse
on another subject   they must speak of the accident at lyme 
lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before 
when a full account of the whole had burst on her  but still it must
be talked of  she must make enquiries  she must regret the imprudence 
lament the result  and captain wentworth s name must be mentioned by both 
anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell 
she could not speak the name  and look straight forward to
lady russell s eye  till she had adopted the expedient of telling her
briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa 
when this was told  his name distressed her no longer 

lady russell had only to listen composedly  and wish them happy 
but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure  in pleased contempt 
that the man who at twenty three had seemed to understand somewhat
of the value of an anne elliot  should  eight years afterwards 
be charmed by a louisa musgrove 

the first three or four days passed most quietly  with no circumstance
to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme 
which found their way to anne  she could not tell how  and brought
a rather improving account of louisa   at the end of that period 
lady russell s politeness could repose no longer  and the fainter
self threatenings of the past became in a decided tone 
 i must call on mrs croft  i really must call upon her soon 
anne  have you courage to go with me  and pay a visit in that house 
it will be some trial to us both  

anne did not shrink from it  on the contrary  she truly felt as she said 
in observing  

 i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two 
your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine 
by remaining in the neighbourhood  i am become inured to it  

she could have said more on the subject  for she had in fact
so high an opinion of the crofts  and considered her father
so very fortunate in his tenants  felt the parish to be so sure
of a good example  and the poor of the best attention and relief 
that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal 
she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone
who deserved not to stay  and that kellynch hall had passed
into better hands than its owners    these convictions must unquestionably
have their own pain  and severe was its kind  but they precluded
that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again 
and returning through the well known apartments 

in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself 
 these rooms ought to belong only to us   oh  how fallen
in their destination   how unworthily occupied   an ancient family
to be so driven away   strangers filling their place  
no  except when she thought of her mother  and remembered where
she had been used to sit and preside  she had no sigh of that description
to heave 

mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure
of fancying herself a favourite  and on the present occasion 
receiving her in that house  there was particular attention 

the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic 
and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid  it appeared
that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn 
that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday  the first time
since the accident   had brought anne the last note  which she had
not been able to trace the exact steps of  had staid a few hours
and then returned again to lyme  and without any present intention
of quitting it any more   he had enquired after her  she found 
particularly  had expressed his hope of miss elliot s not being
the worse for her exertions  and had spoken of those exertions as great 
this was handsome  and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else
could have done 

as to the sad catastrophe itself  it could be canvassed only in one style
by a couple of steady  sensible women  whose judgements had to work
on ascertained events  and it was perfectly decided that it had been
the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence 
that its effects were most alarming  and that it was frightful to think 
how long miss musgrove s recovery might yet be doubtful  and how liable
she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter 
the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming  

 ay  a very bad business indeed   a new sort of way this 
for a young fellow to be making love  by breaking his mistress s head 
is not it  miss elliot   this is breaking a head and giving a plaster 
truly  

admiral croft s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell 
but they delighted anne   his goodness of heart and simplicity
of character were irresistible 

 now  this must be very bad for you   said he  suddenly rousing from
a little reverie   to be coming and finding us here   i had not
recollected it before  i declare  but it must be very bad 
but now  do not stand upon ceremony   get up and go over all the rooms
in the house if you like it  

 another time  sir  i thank you  not now  

 well  whenever it suits you   you can slip in from the shrubbery
at any time  and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up
by that door   a good place is not it   but    checking himself  
 you will not think it a good place  for yours were always kept
in the butler s room   ay  so it always is  i believe 
one man s ways may be as good as another s  but we all like our own best 
and so you must judge for yourself  whether it would be better for you
to go about the house or not  

anne  finding she might decline it  did so  very gratefully 

 we have made very few changes either   continued the admiral 
after thinking a moment    very few   we told you about the laundry door 
at uppercross   that has been a very great improvement 
the wonder was  how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience
of its opening as it did  so long   you will tell sir walter
what we have done  and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement
the house ever had   indeed  i must do ourselves the justice to say 
that the few alterations we have made have been all very much
for the better   my wife should have the credit of them  however 
i have done very little besides sending away some of the large
looking glasses from my dressing room  which was your father s 
a very good man  and very much the gentleman i am sure 
but i should think  miss elliot    looking with serious reflection  
 i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life 
such a number of looking glasses  oh lord  there was no getting away
from one s self   so i got sophy to lend me a hand  and we soon
shifted their quarters  and now i am quite snug  with my
little shaving glass in one corner  and another great thing
that i never go near  

anne  amused in spite of herself  was rather distressed for an answer 
and the admiral  fearing he might not have been civil enough 
took up the subject again  to say  

 the next time you write to your good father  miss elliot 
pray give him my compliments and mrs croft s  and say that we are
settled here quite to our liking  and have no fault at all to find
with the place   the breakfast room chimney smokes a little 
i grant you  but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard 
which may not happen three times a winter   and take it altogether 
now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge 
there is not one that we like better than this   pray say so 
with my compliments   he will be glad to hear it  

lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other 
but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed
far at present  for when it was returned  the crofts announced
themselves to be going away for a few weeks  to visit their connexions
in the north of the county  and probably might not be at home again
before lady russell would be removing to bath 

so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall 
or of seeing him in company with her friend   everything was safe enough 
and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted
on the subject 



chapter 14


though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after
mr and mrs musgrove s going than anne conceived they could have been
at all wanted  they were yet the first of the family to be at home again 
and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross
they drove over to the lodge   they had left louisa beginning to sit up 
but her head  though clear  was exceedingly weak  and her nerves
susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness  and though
she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well 
it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear
the removal home  and her father and mother  who must return
in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays 
had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them 

they had been all in lodgings together   mrs musgrove had
got mrs harville s children away as much as she could  every possible
supply from uppercross had been furnished  to lighten the inconvenience
to the harvilles  while the harvilles had been wanting them
to come to dinner every day  and in short  it seemed to have been
only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested
and hospitable 

mary had had her evils  but upon the whole  as was evident
by her staying so long  she had found more to enjoy than to suffer 
charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her  and when
they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid servant to wait 
and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence 
but then  she had received so very handsome an apology from her
on finding out whose daughter she was  and there had been so much
going on every day  there had been so many walks between their lodgings
and the harvilles  and she had got books from the library 
and changed them so often  that the balance had certainly been
much in favour of lyme   she had been taken to charmouth too 
and she had bathed  and she had gone to church  and there were a great many
more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross 
and all this  joined to the sense of being so very useful 
had made really an agreeable fortnight 

anne enquired after captain benwick  mary s face was clouded directly 
charles laughed 

 oh  captain benwick is very well  i believe  but he is
a very odd young man   i do not know what he would be at 
we asked him to come home with us for a day or two   charles undertook
to give him some shooting  and he seemed quite delighted  and  for my part 
i thought it was all settled  when behold  on tuesday night 
he made a very awkward sort of excuse   he never shot  and he had
 been quite misunderstood   and he had promised this and he had
promised that  and the end of it was  i found  that he did not mean to come 
i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull  but upon my word
i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage
for such a heart broken man as captain benwick  

charles laughed again and said   now mary  you know very well
how it really was   it was all your doing    turning to anne  
 he fancied that if he went with us  he should find you close by 
he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross  and when he discovered
that lady russell lived three miles off  his heart failed him 
and he had not courage to come   that is the fact  upon my honour 
mary knows it is  

but mary did not give into it very graciously  whether from
not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation
to be in love with an elliot  or from not wanting to believe
anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself  must be
left to be guessed   anne s good will  however  was not to be lessened
by what she heard   she boldly acknowledged herself flattered 
and continued her enquiries 

 oh  he talks of you   cried charles   in such terms   
mary interrupted him   i declare  charles  i never heard him
mention anne twice all the time i was there   i declare  anne 
he never talks of you at all  

 no   admitted charles   i do not know that he ever does  in a general
way  but however  it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly 
his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation 
and he wants to talk to you about them  he has found out something or other
in one of them which he thinks  oh  i cannot pretend to remember it 
but it was something very fine  i overheard him telling henrietta
all about it  and then  miss elliot  was spoken of in the highest terms 
now mary  i declare it was so  i heard it myself  and you were
in the other room    elegance  sweetness  beauty   oh  there was no end
of miss elliot s charms  

 and i am sure   cried mary  warmly   it was a very little to his credit 
if he did   miss harville only died last june   such a heart
is very little worth having  is it  lady russell   i am sure
you will agree with me  

 i must see captain benwick before i decide   said lady russell  smiling 

 and that you are very likely to do very soon  i can tell you  ma am  
said charles    though he had not nerves for coming away with us 
and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here 
he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself 
you may depend on it   i told him the distance and the road 
and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing 
for as he has a taste for those sort of things  i thought that would
be a good excuse  and he listened with all his understanding and soul 
and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon 
so  i give you notice  lady russell  

 any acquaintance of anne s will always be welcome to me  
was lady russell s kind answer 

 oh  as to being anne s acquaintance   said mary   i think he is rather
my acquaintance  for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight  

 well  as your joint acquaintance  then  i shall be very happy
to see captain benwick  

 you will not find anything very agreeable in him  i assure you  ma am 
he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived   he has walked with me 
sometimes  from one end of the sands to the other  without saying a word 
he is not at all a well bred young man   i am sure you will not like him  

 there we differ  mary   said anne    i think lady russell would like him 
i think she would be so much pleased with his mind  that she would
very soon see no deficiency in his manner  

 so do i  anne   said charles    i am sure lady russell would like him 
he is just lady russell s sort   give him a book  and he will
read all day long  

 yes  that he will   exclaimed mary  tauntingly    he will sit poring
over his book  and not know when a person speaks to him  or when one
drop s one s scissors  or anything that happens   do you think
lady russell would like that  

lady russell could not help laughing    upon my word   said she 
 i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have
admitted of such difference of conjecture  steady and matter of fact
as i may call myself   i have really a curiosity to see the person
who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions 
i wish he may be induced to call here   and when he does  mary 
you may depend upon hearing my opinion  but i am determined
not to judge him beforehand  

 you will not like him  i will answer for it  

lady russell began talking of something else   mary spoke with animation
of their meeting with  or rather missing  mr elliot so extraordinarily 

 he is a man   said lady russell   whom i have no wish to see 
his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family 
has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me  

this decision checked mary s eagerness  and stopped her short
in the midst of the elliot countenance 

with regard to captain wentworth  though anne hazarded no enquiries 
there was voluntary communication sufficient   his spirits had been
greatly recovering lately as might be expected   as louisa improved 
he had improved  and he was now quite a different creature
from what he had been the first week   he had not seen louisa 
and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her
from an interview  that he did not press for it at all  and 
on the contrary  seemed to have a plan of going away for a week
or ten days  till her head was stronger   he had talked of going
down to plymouth for a week  and wanted to persuade captain benwick
to go with him  but  as charles maintained to the last  captain benwick
seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch 

there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both
occasionally thinking of captain benwick  from this time 
lady russell could not hear the door bell without feeling that it might
be his herald  nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence
in her father s grounds  or any visit of charity in the village 
without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him 
captain benwick came not  however   he was either less disposed for it
than charles had imagined  or he was too shy  and after giving him
a week s indulgence  lady russell determined him to be unworthy
of the interest which he had been beginning to excite 

the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school 
bringing with them mrs harville s little children  to improve the noise
of uppercross  and lessen that of lyme   henrietta remained with louisa 
but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters 

lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once 
when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again 
though neither henrietta  nor louisa  nor charles hayter 
nor captain wentworth were there  the room presented as strong a contrast
as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in 

immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles 
whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children
from the cottage  expressly arrived to amuse them   on one side
was a table occupied by some chattering girls  cutting up silk
and gold paper  and on the other were tressels and trays 
bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies  where riotous boys
were holding high revel  the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire 
which seemed determined to be heard  in spite of all the noise
of the others   charles and mary also came in  of course 
during their visit  and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects
to lady russell  and sat down close to her for ten minutes 
talking with a very raised voice  but from the clamour of the children
on his knees  generally in vain   it was a fine family piece 

anne  judging from her own temperament  would have deemed
such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves 
which louisa s illness must have so greatly shaken   but mrs musgrove 
who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially 
again and again  for all her attentions to them  concluded
a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing 
with a happy glance round the room  that after all she had gone through 
nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness
at home 

louisa was now recovering apace   her mother could even think of her
being able to join their party at home  before her brothers and sisters
went to school again   the harvilles had promised to come with her
and stay at uppercross  whenever she returned   captain wentworth was gone 
for the present  to see his brother in shropshire 

 i hope i shall remember  in future   said lady russell  as soon as
they were reseated in the carriage   not to call at uppercross
in the christmas holidays  

everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters 
and sounds are quite innoxious  or most distressing  by their sort
rather than their quantity   when lady russell not long afterwards 
was entering bath on a wet afternoon  and driving through
the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place 
amidst the dash of other carriages  the heavy rumble of carts and drays 
the bawling of newspapermen  muffin men and milkmen  and the ceaseless
clink of pattens  she made no complaint   no  these were noises
which belonged to the winter pleasures  her spirits rose
under their influence  and like mrs musgrove  she was feeling 
though not saying  that after being long in the country  nothing could be
so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness 

anne did not share these feelings   she persisted in a very determined 
though very silent disinclination for bath  caught the first dim view
of the extensive buildings  smoking in rain  without any wish
of seeing them better  felt their progress through the streets to be 
however disagreeable  yet too rapid  for who would be glad to see her
when she arrived   and looked back  with fond regret  to the bustles
of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch 

elizabeth s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest 
mr elliot was in bath   he had called in camden place  had called
a second time  a third  had been pointedly attentive   if elizabeth
and her father did not deceive themselves  had been taking much pains
to seek the acquaintance  and proclaim the value of the connection 
as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect   this was very wonderful
if it were true  and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable
curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot  already recanting the sentiment
she had so lately expressed to mary  of his being  a man whom she had
no wish to see    she had a great wish to see him   if he really sought
to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch  he must be forgiven
for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree 

anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance 
but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not 
which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath 

she was put down in camden place  and lady russell then drove
to her own lodgings  in rivers street 



chapter 15


sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place 
a lofty dignified situation  such as becomes a man of consequence 
and both he and elizabeth were settled there  much to their satisfaction 

anne entered it with a sinking heart  anticipating an imprisonment
of many months  and anxiously saying to herself   oh  when shall i
leave you again    a degree of unexpected cordiality  however 
in the welcome she received  did her good   her father and sister
were glad to see her  for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture 
and met her with kindness   her making a fourth  when they
sat down to dinner  was noticed as an advantage 

mrs clay was very pleasant  and very smiling  but her courtesies and smiles
were more a matter of course   anne had always felt that she would
pretend what was proper on her arrival  but the complaisance of the others
was unlooked for   they were evidently in excellent spirits 
and she was soon to listen to the causes   they had no inclination
to listen to her   after laying out for some compliments of being
deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood  which anne could not pay 
they had only a few faint enquiries to make  before the talk must be
all their own   uppercross excited no interest  kellynch very little 
it was all bath 

they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered
their expectations in every respect   their house was undoubtedly
the best in camden place  their drawing rooms had many decided advantages
over all the others which they had either seen or heard of 
and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting up 
or the taste of the furniture   their acquaintance was
exceedingly sought after   everybody was wanting to visit them 
they had drawn back from many introductions  and still were
perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing 

here were funds of enjoyment   could anne wonder that her father
and sister were happy   she might not wonder  but she must sigh
that her father should feel no degradation in his change  should see
nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder 
should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town 
and she must sigh  and smile  and wonder too  as elizabeth threw open
the folding doors and walked with exultation from one drawing room
to the other  boasting of their space  at the possibility of that woman 
who had been mistress of kellynch hall  finding extent to be proud of
between two walls  perhaps thirty feet asunder 

but this was not all which they had to make them happy 
they had mr elliot too   anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot 
he was not only pardoned  they were delighted with him 
he had been in bath about a fortnight   he had passed through bath
in november  in his way to london  when the intelligence of
sir walter s being settled there had of course reached him 
though only twenty four hours in the place  but he had not been able
to avail himself of it   but he had now been a fortnight in bath 
and his first object on arriving  had been to leave his card
in camden place  following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet 
and when they did meet  by such great openness of conduct 
such readiness to apologize for the past  such solicitude to be received
as a relation again  that their former good understanding
was completely re established 

they had not a fault to find in him   he had explained away
all the appearance of neglect on his own side   it had originated
in misapprehension entirely   he had never had an idea of
throwing himself off  he had feared that he was thrown off 
but knew not why  and delicacy had kept him silent   upon the hint
of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family
and the family honours  he was quite indignant   he  who had ever boasted
of being an elliot  and whose feelings  as to connection 
were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day 
he was astonished  indeed  but his character and general conduct
must refute it   he could refer sir walter to all who knew him 
and certainly  the pains he had been taking on this  the first opportunity
of reconciliation  to be restored to the footing of a relation
and heir presumptive  was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject 

the circumstances of his marriage  too  were found to admit of
much extenuation   this was an article not to be entered on by himself 
but a very intimate friend of his  a colonel wallis  a highly
respectable man  perfectly the gentleman   and not an ill looking man 
sir walter added   who was living in very good style in marlborough
buildings  and had  at his own particular request  been admitted
to their acquaintance through mr elliot  had mentioned one or two things
relative to the marriage  which made a material difference
in the discredit of it 

colonel wallis had known mr elliot long  had been well acquainted
also with his wife  had perfectly understood the whole story 
she was certainly not a woman of family  but well educated 
accomplished  rich  and excessively in love with his friend 
there had been the charm   she had sought him   without that attraction 
not all her money would have tempted elliot  and sir walter was 
moreover  assured of her having been a very fine woman 
here was a great deal to soften the business   a very fine woman
with a large fortune  in love with him   sir walter seemed to admit it
as complete apology  and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance
in quite so favourable a light  she allowed it be a great extenuation 

mr elliot had called repeatedly  had dined with them once 
evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked  for they
gave no dinners in general  delighted  in short  by every proof
of cousinly notice  and placing his whole happiness in being
on intimate terms in camden place 

anne listened  but without quite understanding it   allowances 
large allowances  she knew  must be made for the ideas of those who spoke 
she heard it all under embellishment   all that sounded extravagant
or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin
but in the language of the relators   still  however  she had
the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared 
in mr elliot s wishing  after an interval of so many years 
to be well received by them   in a worldly view  he had nothing to gain
by being on terms with sir walter  nothing to risk by a state of variance 
in all probability he was already the richer of the two 
and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title 
a sensible man  and he had looked like a very sensible man 
why should it be an object to him   she could only offer one solution 
it was  perhaps  for elizabeth s sake   there might really have been
a liking formerly  though convenience and accident had drawn him
a different way  and now that he could afford to please himself 
he might mean to pay his addresses to her   elizabeth was certainly
very handsome  with well bred  elegant manners  and her character
might never have been penetrated by mr elliot  knowing her but in public 
and when very young himself   how her temper and understanding
might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life
was another concern and rather a fearful one   most earnestly did she wish
that he might not be too nice  or too observant if elizabeth
were his object  and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so 
and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea  seemed apparent
by a glance or two between them  while mr elliot s frequent visits
were talked of 

anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme  but without
being much attended to    oh  yes  perhaps  it had been mr elliot 
they did not know   it might be him  perhaps    they could not listen
to her description of him   they were describing him themselves 
sir walter especially   he did justice to his very gentlemanlike
appearance  his air of elegance and fashion  his good shaped face 
his sensible eye  but  at the same time   must lament his being
very much under hung  a defect which time seemed to have increased 
nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered
almost every feature for the worse   mr elliot appeared to think
that he  sir walter  was looking exactly as he had done when
they last parted   but sir walter had  not been able to return
the compliment entirely  which had embarrassed him   he did not mean
to complain  however   mr elliot was better to look at than most men 
and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere  

mr elliot  and his friends in marlborough buildings  were talked of
the whole evening    colonel wallis had been so impatient to be
introduced to them  and mr elliot so anxious that he should  
and there was a mrs wallis  at present known only to them by description 
as she was in daily expectation of her confinement  but mr elliot
spoke of her as  a most charming woman  quite worthy of being known
in camden place   and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted 
sir walter thought much of mrs wallis  she was said to be
an excessively pretty woman  beautiful    he longed to see her 
he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces
he was continually passing in the streets   the worst of bath was
the number of its plain women   he did not mean to say that there were
no pretty women  but the number of the plain was out of all proportion 
he had frequently observed  as he walked  that one handsome face
would be followed by thirty  or five and thirty frights  and once 
as he had stood in a shop on bond street  he had counted
eighty seven women go by  one after another  without there being
a tolerable face among them   it had been a frosty morning 
to be sure  a sharp frost  which hardly one woman in a thousand
could stand the test of   but still  there certainly were
a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath  and as for the men 
they were infinitely worse   such scarecrows as the streets were full of 
it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything
tolerable  by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced 
he had never walked anywhere arm in arm with colonel wallis
 who was a fine military figure  though sandy haired  without observing
that every woman s eye was upon him  every woman s eye was sure to be
upon colonel wallis    modest sir walter   he was not allowed
to escape  however   his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting
that colonel wallis s companion might have as good a figure
as colonel wallis  and certainly was not sandy haired 

 how is mary looking   said sir walter  in the height of his good humour 
 the last time i saw her she had a red nose  but i hope that may not
happen every day  

 oh  no  that must have been quite accidental   in general she has been
in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas  

 if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds 
and grow coarse  i would send her a new hat and pelisse  

anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown 
or a cap  would not be liable to any such misuse  when a knock at the door
suspended everything    a knock at the door  and so late 
it was ten o clock   could it be mr elliot   they knew he was to dine
in lansdown crescent   it was possible that he might stop in his way home
to ask them how they did   they could think of no one else 
mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot s knock    mrs clay was right 
with all the state which a butler and foot boy could give 
mr elliot was ushered into the room 

it was the same  the very same man  with no difference but of dress 
anne drew a little back  while the others received his compliments 
and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour 
but  he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she
nor her friend had taken cold the day before    c   c  which was
all as politely done  and as politely taken  as possible  but her part
must follow then   sir walter talked of his youngest daughter 
 mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter 
 there was no occasion for remembering mary   and anne  smiling and
blushing  very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features
which he had by no means forgotten  and instantly saw  with amusement
at his little start of surprise  that he had not been at all aware
of who she was   he looked completely astonished  but not more astonished
than pleased  his eyes brightened  and with the most perfect alacrity
he welcomed the relationship  alluded to the past  and entreated
to be received as an acquaintance already   he was quite as good looking
as he had appeared at lyme  his countenance improved by speaking 
and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be  so polished 
so easy  so particularly agreeable  that she could compare them
in excellence to only one person s manners   they were not the same 
but they were  perhaps  equally good 

he sat down with them  and improved their conversation very much 
there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man   ten minutes
were enough to certify that   his tone  his expressions 
his choice of subject  his knowing where to stop  it was all
the operation of a sensible  discerning mind   as soon as he could 
he began to talk to her of lyme  wanting to compare opinions
respecting the place  but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance
of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time 
to give his own route  understand something of hers  and regret that
he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her 
she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme 
his regret increased as he listened   he had spent his whole
solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs  had heard voices 
mirth continually  thought they must be a most delightful set of people 
longed to be with them  but certainly without the smallest suspicion
of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself 
if he had but asked who the party were   the name of musgrove would
have told him enough    well  it would serve to cure him of
an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn 
which he had adopted  when quite a young man  on the principal
of its being very ungenteel to be curious 

 the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty   said he 
 as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing 
are more absurd  i believe  than those of any other set of beings
in the world   the folly of the means they often employ
is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view  

but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone 
he knew it  he was soon diffused again among the others 
and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme 

his enquiries  however  produced at length an account of the scene
she had been engaged in there  soon after his leaving the place 
having alluded to  an accident    he must hear the whole 
when he questioned  sir walter and elizabeth began to question also 
but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt 
she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell  in the wish
of really comprehending what had passed  and in the degree of concern
for what she must have suffered in witnessing it 

he staid an hour with them   the elegant little clock on the mantel 
piece had struck  eleven with its silver sounds   and the watchman
was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale 
before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long 

anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in
camden place could have passed so well 



chapter 16


there was one point which anne  on returning to her family 
would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot s
being in love with elizabeth  which was  her father s not being
in love with mrs clay  and she was very far from easy about it 
when she had been at home a few hours   on going down to breakfast
the next morning  she found there had just been a decent pretence
on the lady s side of meaning to leave them   she could imagine mrs clay
to have said  that  now miss anne was come  she could not suppose herself
at all wanted   for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper 
 that must not be any reason  indeed   i assure you i feel it none 
she is nothing to me  compared with you    and she was in full time
to hear her father say   my dear madam  this must not be   as yet 
you have seen nothing of bath   you have been here only to be useful 
you must not run away from us now   you must stay to be acquainted
with mrs wallis  the beautiful mrs wallis   to your fine mind 
i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification  

he spoke and looked so much in earnest  that anne was not surprised
to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself 
her countenance  perhaps  might express some watchfulness 
but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought
in her sister   the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties 
and promise to stay 

in the course of the same morning  anne and her father chancing to be
alone together  he began to compliment her on her improved looks 
he thought her  less thin in her person  in her cheeks  her skin 
her complexion  greatly improved  clearer  fresher   had she been
using any thing in particular     no  nothing     merely gowland  
he supposed    no  nothing at all     ha  he was surprised at that  
and added   certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are 
you cannot be better than well  or i should recommend gowland 
the constant use of gowland  during the spring months   mrs clay has been
using it at my recommendation  and you see what it has done for her 
you see how it has carried away her freckles  

if elizabeth could but have heard this   such personal praise
might have struck her  especially as it did not appear to anne
that the freckles were at all lessened   but everything must
take its chance   the evil of a marriage would be much diminished 
if elizabeth were also to marry   as for herself  she might always
command a home with lady russell 

lady russell s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial
on this point  in her intercourse in camden place   the sight of mrs clay
in such favour  and of anne so overlooked  was a perpetual provocation
to her there  and vexed her as much when she was away  as a person in bath
who drinks the water  gets all the new publications  and has
a very large acquaintance  has time to be vexed 

as mr elliot became known to her  she grew more charitable 
or more indifferent  towards the others   his manners were
an immediate recommendation  and on conversing with him she found
the solid so fully supporting the superficial  that she was at first 
as she told anne  almost ready to exclaim   can this be mr elliot  
and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable
or estimable man   everything united in him  good understanding 
correct opinions  knowledge of the world  and a warm heart 
he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour 
without pride or weakness  he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune 
without display  he judged for himself in everything essential 
without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum 
he was steady  observant  moderate  candid  never run away with by spirits
or by selfishness  which fancied itself strong feeling  and yet 
with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely  and a value
for all the felicities of domestic life  which characters of
fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess 
she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage   colonel wallis
said it  and lady russell saw it  but it had been no unhappiness
to sour his mind  nor  she began pretty soon to suspect  to prevent his
thinking of a second choice   her satisfaction in mr elliot
outweighed all the plague of mrs clay 

it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she
and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently 
and it did not surprise her  therefore  that lady russell
should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent  nothing to require
more motives than appeared  in mr elliot s great desire of a reconciliation 
in lady russell s view  it was perfectly natural that mr elliot 
at a mature time of life  should feel it a most desirable object 
and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people 
to be on good terms with the head of his family  the simplest process
in the world of time upon a head naturally clear  and only erring
in the heyday of youth   anne presumed  however  still to smile about it 
and at last to mention  elizabeth    lady russell listened  and looked 
and made only this cautious reply    elizabeth  very well 
time will explain  

it was a reference to the future  which anne  after a little observation 
felt she must submit to   she could determine nothing at present 
in that house elizabeth must be first  and she was in the habit
of such general observance as  miss elliot   that any particularity
of attention seemed almost impossible   mr elliot  too 
it must be remembered  had not been a widower seven months 
a little delay on his side might be very excusable   in fact 
anne could never see the crape round his hat  without fearing that
she was the inexcusable one  in attributing to him such imaginations 
for though his marriage had not been very happy  still it had existed
so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery
from the awful impression of its being dissolved 

however it might end  he was without any question their
pleasantest acquaintance in bath   she saw nobody equal to him 
and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme 
which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again  and to see more of 
as herself   they went through the particulars of their first meeting
a great many times   he gave her to understand that he had
looked at her with some earnestness   she knew it well 
and she remembered another person s look also 

they did not always think alike   his value for rank and connexion
she perceived was greater than hers   it was not merely complaisance 
it must be a liking to the cause  which made him enter warmly
into her father and sister s solicitudes on a subject which
she thought unworthy to excite them   the bath paper one morning
announced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple 
and her daughter  the honourable miss carteret  and all the comfort
of no     camden place  was swept away for many days  for the dalrymples
 in anne s opinion  most unfortunately  were cousins of the elliots 
and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly 

anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility 
and she must acknowledge herself disappointed   she had hoped
better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life 
and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen 
a wish that they had more pride  for  our cousins lady dalrymple
and miss carteret    our cousins  the dalrymples   sounded in her ears
all day long 

sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount 
but had never seen any of the rest of the family  and the difficulties
of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse
by letters of ceremony  ever since the death of that said late viscount 
when  in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter s
at the same time  there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch 
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland   the neglect
had been visited on the head of the sinner  for when poor lady elliot
died herself  no letter of condolence was received at kellynch 
and  consequently  there was but too much reason to apprehend
that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed 
how to have this anxious business set to rights  and be admitted
as cousins again  was the question   and it was a question which 
in a more rational manner  neither lady russell nor mr elliot
thought unimportant    family connexions were always worth preserving 
good company always worth seeking  lady dalrymple had taken a house 
for three months  in laura place  and would be living in style 
she had been at bath the year before  and lady russell had heard her
spoken of as a charming woman   it was very desirable that
the connexion should be renewed  if it could be done  without any
compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots  

sir walter  however  would choose his own means  and at last wrote
a very fine letter of ample explanation  regret  and entreaty 
to his right honourable cousin   neither lady russell nor mr elliot
could admire the letter  but it did all that was wanted 
in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess 
 she was very much honoured  and should be happy in their acquaintance  
the toils of the business were over  the sweets began   they visited
in laura place  they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple 
and the honourable miss carteret  to be arranged wherever they might
be most visible   and  our cousins in laura place     our cousin 
lady dalrymple and miss carteret   were talked of to everybody 

anne was ashamed   had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been
very agreeable  she would still have been ashamed of the agitation
they created  but they were nothing   there was no superiority of manner 
accomplishment  or understanding   lady dalrymple had acquired
the name of  a charming woman   because she had a smile and a civil answer
for everybody   miss carteret  with still less to say  was so plain
and so awkward  that she would never have been tolerated in camden place
but for her birth 

lady russell confessed she had expected something better  but yet
 it was an acquaintance worth having   and when anne ventured to speak
her opinion of them to mr elliot  he agreed to their being nothing
in themselves  but still maintained that  as a family connexion 
as good company  as those who would collect good company around them 
they had their value   anne smiled and said 

 my idea of good company  mr elliot  is the company of clever 
well informed people  who have a great deal of conversation 
that is what i call good company  

 you are mistaken   said he gently   that is not good company 
that is the best   good company requires only birth  education 
and manners  and with regard to education is not very nice 
birth and good manners are essential  but a little learning is
by no means a dangerous thing in good company  on the contrary 
it will do very well   my cousin anne shakes her head 
she is not satisfied   she is fastidious   my dear cousin 
 sitting down by her    you have a better right to be fastidious
than almost any other woman i know  but will it answer 
will it make you happy   will it not be wiser to accept the society
of those good ladies in laura place  and enjoy all the advantages
of the connexion as far as possible   you may depend upon it 
that they will move in the first set in bath this winter 
and as rank is rank  your being known to be related to them
will have its use in fixing your family  our family let me say 
in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for  

 yes   sighed anne   we shall  indeed  be known to be related to them  
then recollecting herself  and not wishing to be answered  she added 
 i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken
to procure the acquaintance   i suppose   smiling   i have more pride
than any of you  but i confess it does vex me  that we should be
so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged  which we may
be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them  

 pardon me  dear cousin  you are unjust in your own claims 
in london  perhaps  in your present quiet style of living 
it might be as you say   but in bath  sir walter elliot and his family
will always be worth knowing   always acceptable as acquaintance  

 well   said anne   i certainly am proud  too proud to enjoy a welcome
which depends so entirely upon place  

 i love your indignation   said he   it is very natural 
but here you are in bath  and the object is to be established here
with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot 
you talk of being proud  i am called proud  i know  and i shall not wish
to believe myself otherwise  for our pride  if investigated 
would have the same object  i have no doubt  though the kind may seem
a little different   in one point  i am sure  my dear cousin  
 he continued  speaking lower  though there was no one else in the room 
 in one point  i am sure  we must feel alike   we must feel that
every addition to your father s society  among his equals or superiors 
may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him  

he looked  as he spoke  to the seat which mrs clay had been
lately occupying   a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant 
and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride 
she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay  and her conscience
admitted that his wishing to promote her father s getting
great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her 



chapter 17


while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their
good fortune in laura place  anne was renewing an acquaintance
of a very different description 

she had called on her former governess  and had heard from her
of there being an old school fellow in bath  who had the two strong claims
on her attention of past kindness and present suffering   miss hamilton 
now mrs smith  had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life
when it had been most valuable   anne had gone unhappy to school 
grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved 
feeling her separation from home  and suffering as a girl of fourteen 
of strong sensibility and not high spirits  must suffer at such a time 
and miss hamilton  three years older than herself  but still from the want
of near relations and a settled home  remaining another year at school 
had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened
her misery  and could never be remembered with indifference 

miss hamilton had left school  had married not long afterwards 
was said to have married a man of fortune  and this was all
that anne had known of her  till now that their governess s account
brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form 

she was a widow and poor   her husband had been extravagant 
and at his death  about two years before  had left his affairs
dreadfully involved   she had had difficulties of every sort
to contend with  and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted
with a severe rheumatic fever  which  finally settling in her legs 
had made her for the present a cripple   she had come to bath
on that account  and was now in lodgings near the hot baths 
living in a very humble way  unable even to afford herself
the comfort of a servant  and of course almost excluded from society 

their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit
from miss elliot would give mrs smith  and anne therefore
lost no time in going   she mentioned nothing of what she had heard 
or what she intended  at home   it would excite no proper interest there 
she only consulted lady russell  who entered thoroughly into her sentiments 
and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith s lodgings
in westgate buildings  as anne chose to be taken 

the visit was paid  their acquaintance re established  their interest
in each other more than re kindled   the first ten minutes
had its awkwardness and its emotion   twelve years were gone
since they had parted  and each presented a somewhat different person
from what the other had imagined   twelve years had changed anne
from the blooming  silent  unformed girl of fifteen  to the elegant
little woman of seven and twenty  with every beauty except bloom 
and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle 
and twelve years had transformed the fine looking  well grown miss hamilton 
in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority  into a poor 
infirm  helpless widow  receiving the visit of her former protegee
as a favour  but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon
passed away  and left only the interesting charm of remembering
former partialities and talking over old times 

anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which
she had almost ventured to depend on  and a disposition to converse
and be cheerful beyond her expectation   neither the dissipations
of the past  and she had lived very much in the world  nor the restrictions
of the present  neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have
closed her heart or ruined her spirits 

in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness 
and anne s astonishment increased   she could scarcely imagine
a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith s   she had been
very fond of her husband   she had buried him   she had been
used to affluence   it was gone   she had no child to connect her
with life and happiness again  no relations to assist in the arrangement
of perplexed affairs  no health to make all the rest supportable 
her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour  and a dark bedroom
behind  with no possibility of moving from one to the other without
assistance  which there was only one servant in the house to afford 
and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath 
yet  in spite of all this  anne had reason to believe that she had
moments only of languor and depression  to hours of occupation
and enjoyment   how could it be   she watched  observed  reflected 
and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude
or of resignation only   a submissive spirit might be patient 
a strong understanding would supply resolution  but here was something more 
here was that elasticity of mind  that disposition to be comforted 
that power of turning readily from evil to good  and of finding employment
which carried her out of herself  which was from nature alone 
it was the choicest gift of heaven  and anne viewed her friend
as one of those instances in which  by a merciful appointment 
it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want 

there had been a time  mrs smith told her  when her spirits
had nearly failed   she could not call herself an invalid now 
compared with her state on first reaching bath   then she had  indeed 
been a pitiable object  for she had caught cold on the journey 
and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again
confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain 
and all this among strangers  with the absolute necessity of having
a regular nurse  and finances at that moment particularly unfit
to meet any extraordinary expense   she had weathered it  however 
and could truly say that it had done her good   it had increased
her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands 
she had seen too much of the world  to expect sudden or disinterested
attachment anywhere  but her illness had proved to her that her landlady
had a character to preserve  and would not use her ill  and she had been
particularly fortunate in her nurse  as a sister of her landlady 
a nurse by profession  and who had always a home in that house
when unemployed  chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her 
 and she   said mrs smith   besides nursing me most admirably 
has really proved an invaluable acquaintance   as soon as i could
use my hands she taught me to knit  which has been a great amusement 
and she put me in the way of making these little thread cases 
pin cushions and card racks  which you always find me so busy about 
and which supply me with the means of doing a little good
to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood 
she had a large acquaintance  of course professionally  among those
who can afford to buy  and she disposes of my merchandise 
she always takes the right time for applying   everybody s heart is open 
you know  when they have recently escaped from severe pain 
or are recovering the blessing of health  and nurse rooke
thoroughly understands when to speak   she is a shrewd  intelligent 
sensible woman   hers is a line for seeing human nature  and she has
a fund of good sense and observation  which  as a companion  make her
infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received
 the best education in the world   know nothing worth attending to 
call it gossip  if you will  but when nurse rooke has half an hour s
leisure to bestow on me  she is sure to have something to relate
that is entertaining and profitable   something that makes one
know one s species better   one likes to hear what is going on 
to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly 
to me  who live so much alone  her conversation  i assure you  is a treat  

anne  far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure  replied 
 i can easily believe it   women of that class have great opportunities 
and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to 
such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing 
and it is not merely in its follies  that they are well read 
for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be
most interesting or affecting   what instances must pass before them
of ardent  disinterested  self denying attachment  of heroism  fortitude 
patience  resignation   of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices
that ennoble us most   a sick chamber may often furnish
the worth of volumes  

 yes   said mrs smith more doubtingly   sometimes it may 
though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe 
here and there  human nature may be great in times of trial 
but generally speaking  it is its weakness and not its strength
that appears in a sick chamber   it is selfishness and impatience
rather than generosity and fortitude  that one hears of 
there is so little real friendship in the world  and unfortunately 
 speaking low and tremulously   there are so many who forget
to think seriously till it is almost too late  

anne saw the misery of such feelings   the husband had not been
what he ought  and the wife had been led among that part of mankind
which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved 
it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith  she shook it off 
and soon added in a different tone  

 i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present 
will furnish much either to interest or edify me   she is only nursing
mrs wallis of marlborough buildings  a mere pretty  silly  expensive 
fashionable woman  i believe  and of course will have nothing to report
but of lace and finery   i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis  however 
she has plenty of money  and i intend she shall buy all
the high priced things i have in hand now  

anne had called several times on her friend  before the existence
of such a person was known in camden place   at last  it became necessary
to speak of her  sir walter  elizabeth and mrs clay  returned one morning
from laura place  with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple
for the same evening  and anne was already engaged  to spend that evening
in westgate buildings   she was not sorry for the excuse 
they were only asked  she was sure  because lady dalrymple being
kept at home by a bad cold  was glad to make use of the relationship
which had been so pressed on her  and she declined on her own account
with great alacrity   she was engaged to spend the evening
with an old schoolfellow    they were not much interested in anything
relative to anne  but still there were questions enough asked 
to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was  and elizabeth
was disdainful  and sir walter severe 

 westgate buildings   said he   and who is miss anne elliot
to be visiting in westgate buildings   a mrs smith   a widow mrs smith 
and who was her husband   one of five thousand mr smiths whose names
are to be met with everywhere   and what is her attraction 
that she is old and sickly   upon my word  miss anne elliot 
you have the most extraordinary taste   everything that revolts
other people  low company  paltry rooms  foul air  disgusting associations
are inviting to you   but surely you may put off this old lady
till to morrow   she is not so near her end  i presume 
but that she may hope to see another day   what is her age   forty  

 no  sir  she is not one and thirty  but i do not think i can
put off my engagement  because it is the only evening for some time
which will at once suit her and myself   she goes into the warm bath
to morrow  and for the rest of the week  you know  we are engaged  

 but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance   asked elizabeth 

 she sees nothing to blame in it   replied anne   on the contrary 
she approves it  and has generally taken me when i have
called on mrs smith 

 westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance
of a carriage drawn up near its pavement   observed sir walter 
 sir henry russell s widow  indeed  has no honours to distinguish her arms 
but still it is a handsome equipage  and no doubt is well known
to convey a miss elliot   a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings 
a poor widow barely able to live  between thirty and forty 
a mere mrs smith  an every day mrs smith  of all people and all names
in the world  to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot 
and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility
of england and ireland   mrs smith   such a name  

mrs clay  who had been present while all this passed  now thought it
advisable to leave the room  and anne could have said much 
and did long to say a little in defence of her friend s
not very dissimilar claims to theirs  but her sense of personal respect
to her father prevented her   she made no reply   she left it
to himself to recollect  that mrs smith was not the only widow
in bath between thirty and forty  with little to live on 
and no surname of dignity 

anne kept her appointment  the others kept theirs  and of course
she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening 
she had been the only one of the set absent  for sir walter
and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship s service themselves 
but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others 
and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot 
and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early 
and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements
in order to wait on her   anne had the whole history of all that
such an evening could supply from lady russell   to her 
its greatest interest must be  in having been very much talked of
between her friend and mr elliot  in having been wished for  regretted 
and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause 
her kind  compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow 
sick and reduced  seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot 
he thought her a most extraordinary young woman  in her temper  manners 
mind  a model of female excellence   he could meet even lady russell
in a discussion of her merits  and anne could not be given to understand
so much by her friend  could not know herself to be so highly rated
by a sensible man  without many of those agreeable sensations
which her friend meant to create 

lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot 
she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of
his deserving her  and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks
which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood 
and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing 
she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject 
she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter 
of a possible attachment on his side  of the desirableness of the alliance 
supposing such attachment to be real and returned   anne heard her 
and made no violent exclamations  she only smiled  blushed 
and gently shook her head 

 i am no match maker  as you well know   said lady russell 
 being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events
and calculations   i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence
pay his addresses to you  and if you should be disposed to accept him 
i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together 
a most suitable connection everybody must consider it  but i think
it might be a very happy one  

 mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man  and in many respects
i think highly of him   said anne   but we should not suit  

lady russell let this pass  and only said in rejoinder   i own that
to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch 
the future lady elliot  to look forward and see you occupying
your dear mother s place  succeeding to all her rights 
and all her popularity  as well as to all her virtues  would be
the highest possible gratification to me   you are your mother s self
in countenance and disposition  and if i might be allowed to fancy you
such as she was  in situation and name  and home  presiding and blessing
in the same spot  and only superior to her in being more highly valued 
my dearest anne  it would give me more delight than is often felt
at my time of life  

anne was obliged to turn away  to rise  to walk to a distant table 
and  leaning there in pretended employment  try to subdue the feelings
this picture excited   for a few moments her imagination and her heart
were bewitched   the idea of becoming what her mother had been 
of having the precious name of  lady elliot  first revived in herself 
of being restored to kellynch  calling it her home again 
her home for ever  was a charm which she could not immediately resist 
lady russell said not another word  willing to leave the matter
to its own operation  and believing that  could mr elliot at that moment
with propriety have spoken for himself   she believed  in short 
what anne did not believe   the same image of mr elliot speaking
for himself brought anne to composure again   the charm of kellynch
and of  lady elliot  all faded away   she never could accept him 
and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man
save one  her judgement  on a serious consideration of the possibilities
of such a case was against mr elliot 

though they had now been acquainted a month  she could not be satisfied
that she really knew his character   that he was a sensible man 
an agreeable man  that he talked well  professed good opinions 
seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle  this was all
clear enough   he certainly knew what was right  nor could she fix
on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed  but yet she would
have been afraid to answer for his conduct   she distrusted the past 
if not the present   the names which occasionally dropt
of former associates  the allusions to former practices and pursuits 
suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been 
she saw that there had been bad habits  that sunday travelling
had been a common thing  that there had been a period of his life
 and probably not a short one  when he had been  at least 
careless in all serious matters  and  though he might now think
very differently  who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever 
cautious man  grown old enough to appreciate a fair character 
how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed 

mr elliot was rational  discreet  polished  but he was not open 
there was never any burst of feeling  any warmth of indignation or delight 
at the evil or good of others   this  to anne  was a decided imperfection 
her early impressions were incurable   she prized the frank 
the open hearted  the eager character beyond all others 
warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still   she felt that she could
so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked
or said a careless or a hasty thing  than of those whose presence of mind
never varied  whose tongue never slipped 

mr elliot was too generally agreeable   various as were the tempers
in her father s house  he pleased them all   he endured too well 
stood too well with every body   he had spoken to her with some
degree of openness of mrs clay  had appeared completely to see
what mrs clay was about  and to hold her in contempt  and yet
mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body 

lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend 
for she saw nothing to excite distrust   she could not imagine
a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot  nor did she
ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive
the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church  in the course of
the following autumn 



chapter 18


it was the beginning of february  and anne  having been a month in bath 
was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme 
she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated 
it was three weeks since she had heard at all   she only knew
that henrietta was at home again  and that louisa  though considered to be
recovering fast  was still in lyme  and she was thinking of them all
very intently one evening  when a thicker letter than usual from mary
was delivered to her  and  to quicken the pleasure and surprise 
with admiral and mrs croft s compliments 

the crofts must be in bath   a circumstance to interest her 
they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally 

 what is this   cried sir walter    the crofts have arrived in bath 
the crofts who rent kellynch   what have they brought you  

 a letter from uppercross cottage  sir  

 oh  those letters are convenient passports   they secure an introduction 
i should have visited admiral croft  however  at any rate 
i know what is due to my tenant  

anne could listen no longer  she could not even have told how
the poor admiral s complexion escaped  her letter engrossed her 
it had been begun several days back 


             february 1st 

 my dear anne   i make no apology for my silence  because i know
how little people think of letters in such a place as bath 
you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross  which 
as you well know  affords little to write about   we have had
a very dull christmas  mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party
all the holidays   i do not reckon the hayters as anybody 
the holidays  however  are over at last   i believe no children ever had
such long ones   i am sure i had not   the house was cleared yesterday 
except of the little harvilles  but you will be surprised to hear
they have never gone home   mrs harville must be an odd mother
to part with them so long   i do not understand it   they are
not at all nice children  in my opinion  but mrs musgrove seems to
like them quite as well  if not better  than her grandchildren 
what dreadful weather we have had   it may not be felt in bath 
with your nice pavements  but in the country it is of some consequence 
i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january 
except charles hayter  who had been calling much oftener than was welcome 
between ourselves  i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme
as long as louisa  it would have kept her a little out of his way 
the carriage is gone to day  to bring louisa and the harvilles to morrow 
we are not asked to dine with them  however  till the day after 
mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey 
which is not very likely  considering the care that will be taken of her 
and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to morrow 
i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable  and wish i could be acquainted
with him too  but i have my usual luck   i am always out of the way
when any thing desirable is going on  always the last of my family
to be noticed   what an immense time mrs clay has been staying
with elizabeth   does she never mean to go away   but perhaps
if she were to leave the room vacant  we might not be invited 
let me know what you think of this   i do not expect my children
to be asked  you know   i can leave them at the great house very well 
for a month or six weeks   i have this moment heard that the crofts
are going to bath almost immediately  they think the admiral gouty 
charles heard it quite by chance  they have not had the civility
to give me any notice  or of offering to take anything 
i do not think they improve at all as neighbours   we see nothing of them 
and this is really an instance of gross inattention   charles joins me
in love  and everything proper   yours affectionately 

   mary m    

 i am sorry to say that i am very far from well  and jemima has
just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore throat
very much about   i dare say i shall catch it  and my sore throats 
you know  are always worse than anybody s  


so ended the first part  which had been afterwards put into an envelope 
containing nearly as much more 


 i kept my letter open  that i might send you word how louisa
bore her journey  and now i am extremely glad i did  having a great deal
to add   in the first place  i had a note from mrs croft yesterday 
offering to convey anything to you  a very kind  friendly note indeed 
addressed to me  just as it ought  i shall therefore be able to
make my letter as long as i like   the admiral does not seem very ill 
and i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants 
i shall be truly glad to have them back again   our neighbourhood
cannot spare such a pleasant family   but now for louisa 
i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little 
she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely  and in the evening
we went to ask her how she did  when we were rather surprised
not to find captain benwick of the party  for he had been invited
as well as the harvilles  and what do you think was the reason 
neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa 
and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer
from mr musgrove  for it was all settled between him and her
before she came away  and he had written to her father by captain harville 
true  upon my honour   are not you astonished   i shall be surprised
at least if you ever received a hint of it  for i never did 
mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter 
we are all very well pleased  however  for though it is not equal to her
marrying captain wentworth  it is infinitely better than charles hayter 
and mr musgrove has written his consent  and captain benwick
is expected to day   mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal
on his poor sister s account  but  however  louisa is a great favourite
with both   indeed  mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her
the better for having nursed her   charles wonders what captain wentworth
will say  but if you remember  i never thought him attached to louisa 
i never could see anything of it   and this is the end  you see 
of captain benwick s being supposed to be an admirer of yours 
how charles could take such a thing into his head was always
incomprehensible to me   i hope he will be more agreeable now 
certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove  but a million times better
than marrying among the hayters  


mary need not have feared her sister s being in any degree prepared
for the news   she had never in her life been more astonished 
captain benwick and louisa musgrove   it was almost too wonderful
for belief  and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain
in the room  preserve an air of calmness  and answer the common questions
of the moment   happily for her  they were not many   sir walter
wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses 
and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath
as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in  but had
little curiosity beyond 

 how is mary   said elizabeth  and without waiting for an answer 
 and pray what brings the crofts to bath  

 they come on the admiral s account   he is thought to be gouty  

 gout and decrepitude   said sir walter    poor old gentleman  

 have they any acquaintance here   asked elizabeth 

 i do not know  but i can hardly suppose that  at admiral croft s
time of life  and in his profession  he should not have many acquaintance
in such a place as this  

 i suspect   said sir walter coolly   that admiral croft
will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall 
elizabeth  may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place  

 oh  no  i think not   situated as we are with lady dalrymple  cousins 
we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance
she might not approve   if we were not related  it would not signify 
but as cousins  she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours 
we had better leave the crofts to find their own level 
there are several odd looking men walking about here  who 
i am told  are sailors   the crofts will associate with them  

this was sir walter and elizabeth s share of interest in the letter 
when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention 
in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove  and her fine little boys 
anne was at liberty 

in her own room  she tried to comprehend it   well might charles wonder
how captain wentworth would feel   perhaps he had quitted the field 
had given louisa up  had ceased to love  had found he did not love her 
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity  or anything
akin to ill usage between him and his friend   she could not endure
that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly 

captain benwick and louisa musgrove   the high spirited 
joyous talking louisa musgrove  and the dejected  thinking 
feeling  reading  captain benwick  seemed each of them everything
that would not suit the other   their minds most dissimilar 
where could have been the attraction   the answer soon presented itself 
it had been in situation   they had been thrown together several weeks 
they had been living in the same small family party   since henrietta s
coming away  they must have been depending almost entirely on each other 
and louisa  just recovering from illness  had been in an interesting state 
and captain benwick was not inconsolable   that was a point which anne
had not been able to avoid suspecting before  and instead of drawing
the same conclusion as mary  from the present course of events 
they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some
dawning of tenderness toward herself   she did not mean  however 
to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity  than mary
might have allowed   she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing
young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have
received the same compliment   he had an affectionate heart 
he must love somebody 

she saw no reason against their being happy   louisa had fine
naval fervour to begin with  and they would soon grow more alike 
he would gain cheerfulness  and she would learn to be an enthusiast
for scott and lord byron  nay  that was probably learnt already 
of course they had fallen in love over poetry   the idea of
louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste 
and sentimental reflection was amusing  but she had no doubt
of its being so   the day at lyme  the fall from the cobb 
might influence her health  her nerves  her courage  her character to
the end of her life  as thoroughly as it appeared to have
influenced her fate 

the conclusion of the whole was  that if the woman who had been sensible
of captain wentworth s merits could be allowed to prefer another man 
there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder 
and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it  certainly nothing
to be regretted   no  it was not regret which made anne s heart
beat in spite of herself  and brought the colour into her cheeks
when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free 
she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate 
they were too much like joy  senseless joy 

she longed to see the crofts  but when the meeting took place 
it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them 
the visit of ceremony was paid and returned  and louisa musgrove
was mentioned  and captain benwick  too  without even half a smile 

the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street 
perfectly to sir walter s satisfaction   he was not at all ashamed
of the acquaintance  and did  in fact  think and talk a great deal more
about the admiral  than the admiral ever thought or talked about him 

the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for 
and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form 
and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure 
they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together 
he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout  and mrs croft
seemed to go shares with him in everything  and to walk
for her life to do him good   anne saw them wherever she went 
lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning 
and she never failed to think of them  and never failed to see them 
knowing their feelings as she did  it was a most attractive picture
of happiness to her   she always watched them as long as she could 
delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of 
as they walked along in happy independence  or equally delighted
to see the admiral s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered
an old friend  and observe their eagerness of conversation
when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy  mrs croft
looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her 

anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself 
but it so happened that one morning  about a week or ten days
after the croft s arrival  it suited her best to leave her friend 
or her friend s carriage  in the lower part of the town 
and return alone to camden place  and in walking up milsom street
she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral   he was standing
by himself at a printshop window  with his hands behind him 
in earnest contemplation of some print  and she not only might have
passed him unseen  but was obliged to touch as well as address him
before she could catch his notice   when he did perceive and
acknowledge her  however  it was done with all his usual frankness
and good humour    ha  is it you   thank you  thank you 
this is treating me like a friend   here i am  you see 
staring at a picture   i can never get by this shop without stopping 
but what a thing here is  by way of a boat   do look at it 
did you ever see the like   what queer fellows your fine painters must be 
to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless
old cockleshell as that   and yet here are two gentlemen
stuck up in it mightily at their ease  and looking about them at the rocks
and mountains  as if they were not to be upset the next moment 
which they certainly must be   i wonder where that boat was built  
 laughing heartily    i would not venture over a horsepond in it 
well    turning away    now  where are you bound   can i go anywhere
for you  or with you   can i be of any use  

 none  i thank you  unless you will give me the pleasure of your company
the little way our road lies together   i am going home  


 that i will  with all my heart  and farther  too   yes  yes
we will have a snug walk together  and i have something to tell you
as we go along   there  take my arm  that s right  i do not
feel comfortable if i have not a woman there   lord  what a boat it is  
taking a last look at the picture  as they began to be in motion 

 did you say that you had something to tell me  sir  

 yes  i have  presently   but here comes a friend  captain brigden 
i shall only say   how d ye do   as we pass  however   i shall not stop 
 how d ye do    brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife 
she  poor soul  is tied by the leg   she has a blister on one of her heels 
as large as a three shilling piece   if you look across the street 
you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother   shabby fellows 
both of them   i am glad they are not on this side of the way 
sophy cannot bear them   they played me a pitiful trick once 
got away with some of my best men   i will tell you the whole story
another time   there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson 
look  he sees us  he kisses his hand to you  he takes you for my wife 
ah  the peace has come too soon for that younker   poor old sir archibald 
how do you like bath  miss elliot   it suits us very well 
we are always meeting with some old friend or other  the streets
full of them every morning  sure to have plenty of chat 
and then we get away from them all  and shut ourselves in our lodgings 
and draw in our chairs  and are snug as if we were at kellynch 
ay  or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal 
we do not like our lodgings here the worse  i can tell you 
for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth 
the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way  

when they were got a little farther  anne ventured to press again
for what he had to communicate   she hoped when clear of milsom street
to have her curiosity gratified  but she was still obliged to wait 
for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had
gained the greater space and quiet of belmont  and as she was
not really mrs croft  she must let him have his own way 
as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont  he began  

 well  now you shall hear something that will surprise you 
but first of all  you must tell me the name of the young lady
i am going to talk about   that young lady  you know  that we have
all been so concerned for   the miss musgrove  that all this has been
happening to   her christian name   i always forget her christian name  

anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really
did  but now she could safely suggest the name of  louisa  

 ay  ay  miss louisa musgrove  that is the name   i wish young ladies
had not such a number of fine christian names   i should never be out
if they were all sophys  or something of that sort   well 
this miss louisa  we all thought  you know  was to marry frederick 
he was courting her week after week   the only wonder was 
what they could be waiting for  till the business at lyme came 
then  indeed  it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain
was set to right   but even then there was something odd in their
way of going on   instead of staying at lyme  he went off to plymouth 
and then he went off to see edward   when we came back from minehead
he was gone down to edward s  and there he has been ever since 
we have seen nothing of him since november   even sophy could
not understand it   but now  the matter has take the strangest turn of all 
for this young lady  the same miss musgrove  instead of being
to marry frederick  is to marry james benwick   you know james benwick  

 a little   i am a little acquainted with captain benwick  

 well  she is to marry him   nay  most likely they are married already 
for i do not know what they should wait for  

 i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man   said anne 
 and i understand that he bears an excellent character  

 oh  yes  yes  there is not a word to be said against james benwick 
he is only a commander  it is true  made last summer  and these are
bad times for getting on  but he has not another fault that i know of 
an excellent  good hearted fellow  i assure you  a very active 
zealous officer too  which is more than you would think for  perhaps 
for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice  

 indeed you are mistaken there  sir  i should never augur want of spirit
from captain benwick s manners   i thought them particularly pleasing 
and i will answer for it  they would generally please  

 well  well  ladies are the best judges  but james benwick is rather too
piano for me  and though very likely it is all our partiality 
sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick s manners better than his 
there is something about frederick more to our taste  

anne was caught   she had only meant to oppose the too common idea
of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other 
not at all to represent captain benwick s manners as the very best
that could possibly be  and  after a little hesitation 
she was beginning to say   i was not entering into any comparison
of the two friends   but the admiral interrupted her with  

 and the thing is certainly true   it is not a mere bit of gossip 
we have it from frederick himself   his sister had a letter
from him yesterday  in which he tells us of it  and he had just had it
in a letter from harville  written upon the spot  from uppercross 
i fancy they are all at uppercross  

this was an opportunity which anne could not resist  she said  therefore 
 i hope  admiral  i hope there is nothing in the style of captain
wentworth s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy 
it did seem  last autumn  as if there were an attachment between him
and louisa musgrove  but i hope it may be understood to have worn out
on each side equally  and without violence   i hope his letter
does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man  

 not at all  not at all  there is not an oath or a murmur
from beginning to end  

anne looked down to hide her smile 

 no  no  frederick is not a man to whine and complain  he has
too much spirit for that   if the girl likes another man better 
it is very fit she should have him  

 certainly   but what i mean is  that i hope there is nothing
in captain wentworth s manner of writing to make you suppose
he thinks himself ill used by his friend  which might appear 
you know  without its being absolutely said   i should be very sorry
that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick
should be destroyed  or even wounded  by a circumstance of this sort  

 yes  yes  i understand you   but there is nothing at all of that nature
in the letter   he does not give the least fling at benwick 
does not so much as say   i wonder at it  i have a reason of my own
for wondering at it    no  you would not guess  from his way of writing 
that he had ever thought of this miss  what s her name   for himself 
he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together  and there is
nothing very unforgiving in that  i think  

anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant
to convey  but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther 
she therefore satisfied herself with common place remarks or quiet
attention  and the admiral had it all his own way 

 poor frederick   said he at last    now he must begin all over again
with somebody else   i think we must get him to bath   sophy must write 
and beg him to come to bath   here are pretty girls enough  i am sure 
it would be of no use to go to uppercross again  for that other
miss musgrove  i find  is bespoke by her cousin  the young parson 
do not you think  miss elliot  we had better try to get him to bath  



chapter 19


while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne  and expressing
his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath  captain wentworth
was already on his way thither   before mrs croft had written 
he was arrived  and the very next time anne walked out  she saw him 

mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay   they were
in milsom street   it began to rain  not much  but enough to
make shelter desirable for women  and quite enough to make it
very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being
conveyed home in lady dalrymple s carriage  which was seen waiting
at a little distance  she  anne  and mrs clay  therefore 
turned into molland s  while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple 
to request her assistance   he soon joined them again  successful 
of course  lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home 
and would call for them in a few minutes 

her ladyship s carriage was a barouche  and did not hold
more than four with any comfort   miss carteret was with her mother 
consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation
for all the three camden place ladies   there could be no doubt
as to miss elliot   whoever suffered inconvenience  she must suffer none 
but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility
between the other two   the rain was a mere trifle  and anne was
most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot   but the rain was also
a mere trifle to mrs clay  she would hardly allow it even to drop at all 
and her boots were so thick  much thicker than miss anne s 
and  in short  her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left
to walk with mr elliot as anne could be  and it was discussed between them
with a generosity so polite and so determined  that the others were
obliged to settle it for them  miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay
had a little cold already  and mr elliot deciding on appeal 
that his cousin anne s boots were rather the thickest 

it was fixed accordingly  that mrs clay should be of the party
in the carriage  and they had just reached this point  when anne 
as she sat near the window  descried  most decidedly and distinctly 
captain wentworth walking down the street 

her start was perceptible only to herself  but she instantly felt that
she was the greatest simpleton in the world  the most unaccountable
and absurd   for a few minutes she saw nothing before her 
it was all confusion   she was lost  and when she had scolded
back her senses  she found the others still waiting for the carriage 
and mr elliot  always obliging  just setting off for union street
on a commission of mrs clay s 

she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door 
she wanted to see if it rained   why was she to suspect herself
of another motive   captain wentworth must be out of sight 
she left her seat  she would go  one half of her should not be always
so much wiser than the other half  or always suspecting the other
of being worse than it was   she would see if it rained 
she was sent back  however  in a moment by the entrance of
captain wentworth himself  among a party of gentlemen and ladies 
evidently his acquaintance  and whom he must have joined
a little below milsom street   he was more obviously struck
and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before 
he looked quite red   for the first time  since their renewed acquaintance 
she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two 
she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments 
all the overpowering  blinding  bewildering  first effects
of strong surprise were over with her   still  however 
she had enough to feel   it was agitation  pain  pleasure 
a something between delight and misery 

he spoke to her  and then turned away   the character of his manner
was embarrassment   she could not have called it either cold or friendly 
or anything so certainly as embarrassed 

after a short interval  however  he came towards her  and spoke again 
mutual enquiries on common subjects passed   neither of them  probably 
much the wiser for what they heard  and anne continuing fully sensible
of his being less at ease than formerly   they had by dint of being
so very much together  got to speak to each other with a considerable
portion of apparent indifference and calmness  but he could not do it now 
time had changed him  or louisa had changed him   there was consciousness
of some sort or other   he looked very well  not as if he had been
suffering in health or spirits  and he talked of uppercross 
of the musgroves  nay  even of louisa  and had even a momentary look
of his own arch significance as he named her  but yet it was
captain wentworth not comfortable  not easy  not able to feign that he was 

it did not surprise  but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth
would not know him   she saw that he saw elizabeth  that elizabeth saw him 
that there was complete internal recognition on each side 
she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance 
expecting it  and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away
with unalterable coldness 

lady dalrymple s carriage  for which miss elliot was growing
very impatient  now drew up  the servant came in to announce it 
it was beginning to rain again  and altogether there was a delay 
and a bustle  and a talking  which must make all the little crowd
in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey
miss elliot   at last miss elliot and her friend  unattended but
by the servant   for there was no cousin returned   were walking off 
and captain wentworth  watching them  turned again to anne 
and by manner  rather than words  was offering his services to her 

 i am much obliged to you   was her answer   but i am not going with them 
the carriage would not accommodate so many   i walk   i prefer walking  

 but it rains  

 oh  very little   nothing that i regard  

after a moment s pause he said    though i came only yesterday 
i have equipped myself properly for bath already  you see  
 pointing to a new umbrella    i wish you would make use of it 
if you are determined to walk  though i think it would be more prudent
to let me get you a chair  

she was very much obliged to him  but declined it all  repeating
her conviction  that the rain would come to nothing at present 
and adding   i am only waiting for mr elliot   he will be here in a moment 
i am sure  

she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in 
captain wentworth recollected him perfectly   there was no difference
between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme 
admiring anne as she passed  except in the air and look and manner
of the privileged relation and friend   he came in with eagerness 
appeared to see and think only of her  apologised for his stay 
was grieved to have kept her waiting  and anxious to get her away
without further loss of time and before the rain increased 
and in another moment they walked off together  her arm under his 
a gentle and embarrassed glance  and a  good morning to you  
being all that she had time for  as she passed away 

as soon as they were out of sight  the ladies of captain wentworth s party
began talking of them 

 mr elliot does not dislike his cousin  i fancy  

 oh  no  that is clear enough   one can guess what will happen there 
he is always with them  half lives in the family  i believe 
what a very good looking man  

 yes  and miss atkinson  who dined with him once at the wallises 
says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with  

 she is pretty  i think  anne elliot  very pretty  when one comes
to look at her   it is not the fashion to say so  but i confess
i admire her more than her sister  

 oh  so do i  

 and so do i   no comparison   but the men are all wild after miss elliot 
anne is too delicate for them  

anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin  if he would have
walked by her side all the way to camden place  without saying a word 
she had never found it so difficult to listen to him  though nothing
could exceed his solicitude and care  and though his subjects
were principally such as were wont to be always interesting 
praise  warm  just  and discriminating  of lady russell 
and insinuations highly rational against mrs clay   but just now
she could think only of captain wentworth   she could not understand
his present feelings  whether he were really suffering much
from disappointment or not  and till that point were settled 
she could not be quite herself 

she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time  but alas  alas 
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet 

another circumstance very essential for her to know  was how long
he meant to be in bath  he had not mentioned it  or she could not
recollect it   he might be only passing through   but it was more probable
that he should be come to stay   in that case  so liable as every body was
to meet every body in bath  lady russell would in all likelihood
see him somewhere   would she recollect him   how would it all be 

she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove
was to marry captain benwick   it had cost her something to encounter
lady russell s surprise  and now  if she were by any chance
to be thrown into company with captain wentworth  her imperfect knowledge
of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him 

the following morning anne was out with her friend  and for the first hour 
in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain  but at last 
in returning down pulteney street  she distinguished him
on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view
the greater part of the street   there were many other men about him 
many groups walking the same way  but there was no mistaking him 
she looked instinctively at lady russell  but not from any mad idea
of her recognising him so soon as she did herself   no  it was
not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they
were nearly opposite   she looked at her however  from time to time 
anxiously  and when the moment approached which must point him out 
though not daring to look again  for her own countenance she knew
was unfit to be seen   she was yet perfectly conscious of
lady russell s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him  
of her being  in short  intently observing him   she could thoroughly
comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell s mind 
the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes  the astonishment
she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him 
and in foreign climes and in active service too  without robbing him
of one personal grace 

at last  lady russell drew back her head    now  how would she
speak of him  

 you will wonder   said she   what has been fixing my eye so long 
but i was looking after some window curtains  which lady alicia and
mrs frankland were telling me of last night   they described
the drawing room window curtains of one of the houses on this
side of the way  and this part of the street  as being the handsomest
and best hung of any in bath  but could not recollect the exact number 
and i have been trying to find out which it could be  but i confess
i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description  

anne sighed and blushed and smiled  in pity and disdain 
either at her friend or herself   the part which provoked her most 
was that in all this waste of foresight and caution  she should have
lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them 

a day or two passed without producing anything   the theatre or the rooms 
where he was most likely to be  were not fashionable enough
for the elliots  whose evening amusements were solely in the
elegant stupidity of private parties  in which they were getting
more and more engaged  and anne  wearied of such a state of stagnation 
sick of knowing nothing  and fancying herself stronger because
her strength was not tried  was quite impatient for the concert evening 
it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple 
of course they must attend   it was really expected to be a good one 
and captain wentworth was very fond of music   if she could only have
a few minutes conversation with him again  she fancied she should
be satisfied  and as to the power of addressing him  she felt all over
courage if the opportunity occurred   elizabeth had turned from him 
lady russell overlooked him  her nerves were strengthened
by these circumstances  she felt that she owed him attention 

she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her 
but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off 
with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow 
mrs smith gave a most good humoured acquiescence 

 by all means   said she   only tell me all about it  when you do come 
who is your party  

anne named them all   mrs smith made no reply  but when she was
leaving her said  and with an expression half serious  half arch 
 well  i heartily wish your concert may answer  and do not fail me
to morrow if you can come  for i begin to have a foreboding
that i may not have many more visits from you  

anne was startled and confused  but after standing in a moment s suspense 
was obliged  and not sorry to be obliged  to hurry away 



chapter 20


sir walter  his two daughters  and mrs clay  were the earliest
of all their party at the rooms in the evening  and as lady dalrymple
must be waited for  they took their station by one of the fires
in the octagon room   but hardly were they so settled  when the door
opened again  and captain wentworth walked in alone   anne was
the nearest to him  and making yet a little advance  she instantly spoke 
he was preparing only to bow and pass on  but her gentle  how do you do  
brought him out of the straight line to stand near her  and make enquiries
in return  in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground 
their being in the back ground was a support to anne  she knew nothing
of their looks  and felt equal to everything which she believed
right to be done 

while they were speaking  a whispering between her father and elizabeth
caught her ear   she could not distinguish  but she must guess the subject 
and on captain wentworth s making a distant bow  she comprehended
that her father had judged so well as to give him that
simple acknowledgement of acquaintance  and she was just in time
by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself 
this  though late  and reluctant  and ungracious  was yet
better than nothing  and her spirits improved 

after talking  however  of the weather  and bath  and the concert 
their conversation began to flag  and so little was said at last 
that she was expecting him to go every moment  but he did not 
he seemed in no hurry to leave her  and presently with renewed spirit 
with a little smile  a little glow  he said  

 i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme   i am afraid you must have
suffered from the shock  and the more from its not overpowering you
at the time  

she assured him that she had not 

 it was a frightful hour   said he   a frightful day   and he
passed his hand across his eyes  as if the remembrance were still
too painful  but in a moment  half smiling again  added 
 the day has produced some effects however  has had some consequences
which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful 
when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be
the properest person to fetch a surgeon  you could have little idea
of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery  

 certainly i could have none   but it appears  i should hope it would be
a very happy match   there are on both sides good principles
and good temper  

 yes   said he  looking not exactly forward   but there  i think 
ends the resemblance   with all my soul i wish them happy  and rejoice
over every circumstance in favour of it   they have no difficulties
to contend with at home  no opposition  no caprice  no delays 
the musgroves are behaving like themselves  most honourably and kindly 
only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter s comfort 
all this is much  very much in favour of their happiness 
more than perhaps   

he stopped   a sudden recollection seemed to occur  and to give him
some taste of that emotion which was reddening anne s cheeks
and fixing her eyes on the ground   after clearing his throat  however 
he proceeded thus  

 i confess that i do think there is a disparity  too great a disparity 
and in a point no less essential than mind   i regard louisa musgrove
as a very amiable  sweet tempered girl  and not deficient in understanding 
but benwick is something more   he is a clever man  a reading man 
and i confess  that i do consider his attaching himself to her
with some surprise   had it been the effect of gratitude 
had he learnt to love her  because he believed her to be preferring him 
it would have been another thing   but i have no reason to suppose it so 
it seems  on the contrary  to have been a perfectly spontaneous 
untaught feeling on his side  and this surprises me   a man like him 
in his situation  with a heart pierced  wounded  almost broken 
fanny harville was a very superior creature  and his attachment to her
was indeed attachment   a man does not recover from such
a devotion of the heart to such a woman   he ought not  he does not  

either from the consciousness  however  that his friend had recovered 
or from other consciousness  he went no farther  and anne who 
in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered 
and in spite of all the various noises of the room  the almost ceaseless
slam of the door  and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through 
had distinguished every word  was struck  gratified  confused 
and beginning to breathe very quick  and feel an hundred things
in a moment   it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject 
and yet  after a pause  feeling the necessity of speaking 
and having not the smallest wish for a total change  she only deviated
so far as to say  

 you were a good while at lyme  i think  

 about a fortnight   i could not leave it till louisa s doing well
was quite ascertained   i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief
to be soon at peace   it had been my doing  solely mine 
she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak 
the country round lyme is very fine   i walked and rode a great deal 
and the more i saw  the more i found to admire  

 i should very much like to see lyme again   said anne 

 indeed   i should not have supposed that you could have found
anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling   the horror and distress
you were involved in  the stretch of mind  the wear of spirits 
i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been
strong disgust  

 the last hours were certainly very painful   replied anne 
 but when pain is over  the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure 
one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it 
unless it has been all suffering  nothing but suffering  which was
by no means the case at lyme   we were only in anxiety and distress
during the last two hours  and previously there had been a great deal
of enjoyment   so much novelty and beauty  i have travelled so little 
that every fresh place would be interesting to me  but there is real beauty
at lyme  and in short   with a faint blush at some recollections  
 altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable  

as she ceased  the entrance door opened again  and the very party appeared
for whom they were waiting    lady dalrymple  lady dalrymple  
was the rejoicing sound  and with all the eagerness compatible
with anxious elegance  sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward
to meet her   lady dalrymple and miss carteret  escorted by mr elliot
and colonel wallis  who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant 
advanced into the room   the others joined them  and it was
a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included 
she was divided from captain wentworth   their interesting 
almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time 
but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on 
she had learnt  in the last ten minutes  more of his feelings
towards louisa  more of all his feelings than she dared to think of 
and she gave herself up to the demands of the party  to the needful
civilities of the moment  with exquisite  though agitated sensations 
she was in good humour with all   she had received ideas which
disposed her to be courteous and kind to all  and to pity every one 
as being less happy than herself 

the delightful emotions were a little subdued  when on stepping back
from the group  to be joined again by captain wentworth  she saw
that he was gone   she was just in time to see him turn into
the concert room   he was gone  he had disappeared  she felt
a moment s regret   but  they should meet again   he would look for her 
he would find her out before the evening were over  and at present 
perhaps  it was as well to be asunder   she was in need of
a little interval for recollection  

upon lady russell s appearance soon afterwards  the whole party
was collected  and all that remained was to marshal themselves 
and proceed into the concert room  and be of all the consequence
in their power  draw as many eyes  excite as many whispers 
and disturb as many people as they could 

very  very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in 
elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret  and looking on the broad back
of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her  had nothing to wish for
which did not seem within her reach  and anne  but it would be
an insult to the nature of anne s felicity  to draw any comparison
between it and her sister s  the origin of one all selfish vanity 
of the other all generous attachment 

anne saw nothing  thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room 
her happiness was from within   her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed 
but she knew nothing about it   she was thinking only of
the last half hour  and as they passed to their seats  her mind took
a hasty range over it   his choice of subjects  his expressions 
and still more his manner and look  had been such as she could see
in only one light   his opinion of louisa musgrove s inferiority 
an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give  his wonder
at captain benwick  his feelings as to a first  strong attachment 
sentences begun which he could not finish  his half averted eyes
and more than half expressive glance  all  all declared that he had
a heart returning to her at least  that anger  resentment  avoidance 
were no more  and that they were succeeded  not merely by friendship
and regard  but by the tenderness of the past   yes  some share of
the tenderness of the past   she could not contemplate the change
as implying less   he must love her 

these were thoughts  with their attendant visions  which occupied
and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation 
and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him 
without even trying to discern him   when their places were determined on 
and they were all properly arranged  she looked round to see
if he should happen to be in the same part of the room  but he was not 
her eye could not reach him  and the concert being just opening 
she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way 

the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches 
anne was among those on the foremost  and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well 
with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis  as to have a seat by her 
miss elliot  surrounded by her cousins  and the principal object
of colonel wallis s gallantry  was quite contented 

anne s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment
of the evening  it was just occupation enough   she had feelings for
the tender  spirits for the gay  attention for the scientific 
and patience for the wearisome  and had never liked a concert better 
at least during the first act   towards the close of it 
in the interval succeeding an italian song  she explained
the words of the song to mr elliot   they had a concert bill between them 

 this   said she   is nearly the sense  or rather the meaning of the words 
for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of 
but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give  for i do not pretend
to understand the language   i am a very poor italian scholar  

 yes  yes  i see you are   i see you know nothing of the matter 
you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight
these inverted  transposed  curtailed italian lines  into clear 
comprehensible  elegant english   you need not say anything more
of your ignorance   here is complete proof  

 i will not oppose such kind politeness  but i should be sorry to be
examined by a real proficient  

 i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long  
replied he   without knowing something of miss anne elliot 
and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general
to be aware of half her accomplishments  and too highly accomplished
for modesty to be natural in any other woman  

 for shame  for shame  this is too much flattery   i forget what we are
to have next   turning to the bill 

 perhaps   said mr elliot  speaking low   i have had a longer acquaintance
with your character than you are aware of  

 indeed   how so   you can have been acquainted with it only since
i came to bath  excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of
in my own family  

 i knew you by report long before you came to bath   i had heard you
described by those who knew you intimately   i have been acquainted
with you by character many years   your person  your disposition 
accomplishments  manner  they were all present to me  

mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise 
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery   to have been
described long ago to a recent acquaintance  by nameless people 
is irresistible  and anne was all curiosity   she wondered 
and questioned him eagerly  but in vain   he delighted in being asked 
but he would not tell 

 no  no  some time or other  perhaps  but not now   he would mention
no names now  but such  he could assure her  had been the fact 
he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot
as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit  and excited
the warmest curiosity to know her  

anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with
partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford 
captain wentworth s brother   he might have been in mr elliot s company 
but she had not courage to ask the question 

 the name of anne elliot   said he   has long had an interesting sound to me 
very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy  and  if i dared 
i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change  

such  she believed  were his words  but scarcely had she
received their sound  than her attention was caught by other sounds
immediately behind her  which rendered every thing else trivial 
her father and lady dalrymple were speaking 

 a well looking man   said sir walter   a very well looking man  

 a very fine young man indeed   said lady dalrymple    more air
than one often sees in bath   irish  i dare say  

 no  i just know his name   a bowing acquaintance   wentworth 
captain wentworth of the navy   his sister married my tenant
in somersetshire  the croft  who rents kellynch  

before sir walter had reached this point  anne s eyes had caught
the right direction  and distinguished captain wentworth standing
among a cluster of men at a little distance   as her eyes fell on him 
his seemed to be withdrawn from her   it had that appearance 
it seemed as if she had been one moment too late  and as long as she
dared observe  he did not look again   but the performance
was recommencing  and she was forced to seem to restore her attention
to the orchestra and look straight forward 

when she could give another glance  he had moved away   he could not have
come nearer to her if he would  she was so surrounded and shut in 
but she would rather have caught his eye 

mr elliot s speech  too  distressed her   she had no longer
any inclination to talk to him   she wished him not so near her 

the first act was over   now she hoped for some beneficial change 
and  after a period of nothing saying amongst the party  some of them
did decide on going in quest of tea   anne was one of the few who
did not choose to move   she remained in her seat  and so did lady russell 
but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot  and she did not mean 
whatever she might feel on lady russell s account  to shrink from
conversation with captain wentworth  if he gave her the opportunity 
she was persuaded by lady russell s countenance that she had seen him 

he did not come however   anne sometimes fancied she discerned him
at a distance  but he never came   the anxious interval
wore away unproductively   the others returned  the room filled again 
benches were reclaimed and repossessed  and another hour of pleasure
or of penance was to be sat out  another hour of music was to give
delight or the gapes  as real or affected taste for it prevailed 
to anne  it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation 
she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth
once more  without the interchange of one friendly look 

in re settling themselves there were now many changes  the result of which
was favourable for her   colonel wallis declined sitting down again 
and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret  in a manner
not to be refused  to sit between them  and by some other removals 
and a little scheming of her own   anne was enabled to place herself
much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before 
much more within reach of a passer by   she could not do so 
without comparing herself with miss larolles  the inimitable miss larolles 
but still she did it  and not with much happier effect 
though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication
in her next neighbours  she found herself at the very end of the bench
before the concert closed 

such was her situation  with a vacant space at hand  when captain wentworth
was again in sight   she saw him not far off   he saw her too 
yet he looked grave  and seemed irresolute  and only by very slow degrees
came at last near enough to speak to her   she felt that something
must be the matter   the change was indubitable   the difference
between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room
was strikingly great   why was it   she thought of her father 
of lady russell   could there have been any unpleasant glances 
he began by speaking of the concert gravely  more like the captain
wentworth of uppercross  owned himself disappointed  had expected singing 
and in short  must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over 
anne replied  and spoke in defence of the performance so well 
and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly  that his countenance
improved  and he replied again with almost a smile   they talked
for a few minutes more  the improvement held  he even looked down
towards the bench  as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying 
when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round 
it came from mr elliot   he begged her pardon  but she must be applied to 
to explain italian again   miss carteret was very anxious to have
a general idea of what was next to be sung   anne could not refuse 
but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit 

a few minutes  though as few as possible  were inevitably consumed 
and when her own mistress again  when able to turn and look
as she had done before  she found herself accosted by captain wentworth 
in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell    he must wish her good night 
he was going  he should get home as fast as he could  

 is not this song worth staying for   said anne  suddenly struck
by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging 

 no   he replied impressively   there is nothing worth my staying for  
and he was gone directly 

jealousy of mr elliot   it was the only intelligible motive 
captain wentworth jealous of her affection   could she have believed it
a week ago  three hours ago   for a moment the gratification was exquisite 
but  alas  there were very different thoughts to succeed 
how was such jealousy to be quieted   how was the truth to reach him 
how  in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations 
would he ever learn of her real sentiments   it was misery to think
of mr elliot s attentions   their evil was incalculable 



chapter 21


anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise
of going to mrs smith  meaning that it should engage her from home
at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call  for to avoid
mr elliot was almost a first object 

she felt a great deal of good will towards him   in spite of
the mischief of his attentions  she owed him gratitude and regard 
perhaps compassion   she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary
circumstances attending their acquaintance  of the right which
he seemed to have to interest her  by everything in situation 
by his own sentiments  by his early prepossession   it was altogether
very extraordinary  flattering  but painful   there was much to regret 
how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case 
was not worth enquiry  for there was a captain wentworth 
and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad 
her affection would be his for ever   their union  she believed 
could not divide her more from other men  than their final separation 

prettier musings of high wrought love and eternal constancy 
could never have passed along the streets of bath  than anne
was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings 
it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way 

she was sure of a pleasant reception  and her friend seemed this morning
particularly obliged to her for coming  seemed hardly to have expected her 
though it had been an appointment 

an account of the concert was immediately claimed  and anne s recollections
of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features
and make her rejoice to talk of it   all that she could tell
she told most gladly  but the all was little for one who had been there 
and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith  who had
already heard  through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter 
rather more of the general success and produce of the evening
than anne could relate  and who now asked in vain for several particulars
of the company   everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath
was well know by name to mrs smith 

 the little durands were there  i conclude   said she   with their mouths
open to catch the music  like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed 
they never miss a concert  

 yes  i did not see them myself  but i heard mr elliot say they were
in the room  

 the ibbotsons  were they there  and the two new beauties 
with the tall irish officer  who is talked of for one of them  

 i do not know   i do not think they were  

 old lady mary maclean   i need not ask after her   she never misses 
i know  and you must have seen her   she must have been in your own circle 
for as you went with lady dalrymple  you were in the seats of grandeur 
round the orchestra  of course  

 no  that was what i dreaded   it would have been very unpleasant to me
in every respect   but happily lady dalrymple always chooses
to be farther off  and we were exceedingly well placed  that is 
for hearing  i must not say for seeing  because i appear to have seen
very little  

 oh  you saw enough for your own amusement   i can understand 
there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd 
and this you had   you were a large party in yourselves 
and you wanted nothing beyond  

 but i ought to have looked about me more   said anne  conscious
while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about 
that the object only had been deficient 

 no  no  you were better employed   you need not tell me that you
had a pleasant evening   i see it in your eye   i perfectly see
how the hours passed   that you had always something agreeable
to listen to   in the intervals of the concert it was conversation  

anne half smiled and said   do you see that in my eye  

 yes  i do   your countenance perfectly informs me that you were
in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable
in the world  the person who interests you at this present time
more than all the rest of the world put together  

a blush overspread anne s cheeks   she could say nothing 

 and such being the case   continued mrs smith  after a short pause 
 i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness
in coming to me this morning   it is really very good of you
to come and sit with me  when you must have so many pleasanter demands
upon your time  

anne heard nothing of this   she was still in the astonishment and
confusion excited by her friend s penetration  unable to imagine
how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her 
after another short silence  

 pray   said mrs smith   is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me 
does he know that i am in bath  

 mr elliot   repeated anne  looking up surprised   a moment s reflection
shewed her the mistake she had been under   she caught it instantaneously 
and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety  soon added 
more composedly   are you acquainted with mr elliot  

 i have been a good deal acquainted with him   replied mrs smith  gravely 
 but it seems worn out now   it is a great while since we met  

 i was not at all aware of this   you never mentioned it before 
had i known it  i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you  

 to confess the truth   said mrs smith  assuming her usual
air of cheerfulness   that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have 
i want you to talk about me to mr elliot   i want your interest with him 
he can be of essential service to me  and if you would have the goodness 
my dear miss elliot  to make it an object to yourself 
of course it is done  

 i should be extremely happy  i hope you cannot doubt my willingness
to be of even the slightest use to you   replied anne   but i suspect
that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot 
a greater right to influence him  than is really the case 
i am sure you have  somehow or other  imbibed such a notion 
you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation   if in that light
there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him 
i beg you would not hesitate to employ me  

mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance  and then  smiling  said  

 i have been a little premature  i perceive  i beg your pardon 
i ought to have waited for official information   but now  my dear
miss elliot  as an old friend  do give me a hint as to when i may speak 
next week   to be sure by next week i may be allowed to
think it all settled  and build my own selfish schemes on
mr elliot s good fortune  

 no   replied anne   nor next week  nor next  nor next 
i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of
will be settled any week   i am not going to marry mr elliot 
i should like to know why you imagine i am  

mrs smith looked at her again  looked earnestly  smiled 
shook her head  and exclaimed  

 now  how i do wish i understood you   how i do wish i knew
what you were at   i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel 
when the right moment occurs   till it does come  you know 
we women never mean to have anybody   it is a thing of course among us 
that every man is refused  till he offers   but why should you be cruel 
let me plead for my  present friend i cannot call him  but for
my former friend   where can you look for a more suitable match 
where could you expect a more gentlemanlike  agreeable man 
let me recommend mr elliot   i am sure you hear nothing but good of him
from colonel wallis  and who can know him better than colonel wallis  

 my dear mrs smith  mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above
half a year   he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses
to any one  

 oh  if these are your only objections   cried mrs smith  archly 
 mr elliot is safe  and i shall give myself no more trouble about him 
do not forget me when you are married  that s all   let him know me to be
a friend of yours  and then he will think little of the trouble required 
which it is very natural for him now  with so many affairs and engagements
of his own  to avoid and get rid of as he can  very natural  perhaps 
ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same   of course 
he cannot be aware of the importance to me   well  my dear miss elliot 
i hope and trust you will be very happy   mr elliot has sense
to understand the value of such a woman   your peace will not be
shipwrecked as mine has been   you are safe in all worldly matters 
and safe in his character   he will not be led astray  he will not be
misled by others to his ruin  

 no   said anne   i can readily believe all that of my cousin 
he seems to have a calm decided temper  not at all open
to dangerous impressions   i consider him with great respect 
i have no reason  from any thing that has fallen within my observation 
to do otherwise   but i have not known him long  and he is not a man 
i think  to be known intimately soon   will not this manner
of speaking of him  mrs smith  convince you that he is nothing to me 
surely this must be calm enough   and  upon my word  he is nothing to me 
should he ever propose to me  which i have very little reason to imagine
he has any thought of doing   i shall not accept him   i assure you
i shall not   i assure you  mr elliot had not the share which
you have been supposing  in whatever pleasure the concert
of last night might afford   not mr elliot  it is not mr elliot that   

she stopped  regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much 
but less would hardly have been sufficient   mrs smith would hardly
have believed so soon in mr elliot s failure  but from the perception
of there being a somebody else   as it was  she instantly submitted 
and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond  and anne 
eager to escape farther notice  was impatient to know why mrs smith
should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot  where she could have
received the idea  or from whom she could have heard it 

 do tell me how it first came into your head  

 it first came into my head   replied mrs smith   upon finding how much
you were together  and feeling it to be the most probable thing
in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you 
and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you
in the same way   but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago  

 and has it indeed been spoken of  

 did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when
you called yesterday  

 no   was not it mrs speed  as usual  or the maid   i observed
no one in particular  

 it was my friend mrs rooke  nurse rooke  who  by the bye 
had a great curiosity to see you  and was delighted to be in the way
to let you in   she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday 
and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot 
she had had it from mrs wallis herself  which did not seem bad authority 
she sat an hour with me on monday evening  and gave me the whole history  
 the whole history   repeated anne  laughing    she could not make
a very long history  i think  of one such little article
of unfounded news  

mrs smith said nothing 

 but   continued anne  presently   though there is no truth in my having
this claim on mr elliot  i should be extremely happy to be of use to you
in any way that i could   shall i mention to him your being in bath 
shall i take any message  

 no  i thank you   no  certainly not   in the warmth of the moment 
and under a mistaken impression  i might  perhaps  have endeavoured
to interest you in some circumstances  but not now   no  i thank you 
i have nothing to trouble you with  

 i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years  

 i did  

 not before he was married  i suppose  

 yes  he was not married when i knew him first  

 and  were you much acquainted  

 intimately  

 indeed   then do tell me what he was at that time of life 
i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man 
was he at all such as he appears now  

 i have not seen mr elliot these three years   was mrs smith s answer 
given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther 
and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity 
they were both silent   mrs smith very thoughtful   at last  

 i beg your pardon  my dear miss elliot   she cried  in her
natural tone of cordiality   i beg your pardon for the short answers
i have been giving you  but i have been uncertain what i ought to do 
i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you 
there were many things to be taken into the account   one hates
to be officious  to be giving bad impressions  making mischief 
even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving 
though there may be nothing durable beneath   however  i have determined 
i think i am right  i think you ought to be made acquainted
with mr elliot s real character   though i fully believe that 
at present  you have not the smallest intention of accepting him 
there is no saying what may happen   you might  some time or other 
be differently affected towards him   hear the truth  therefore 
now  while you are unprejudiced   mr elliot is a man without heart
or conscience  a designing  wary  cold blooded being  who thinks
only of himself  whom for his own interest or ease  would be guilty
of any cruelty  or any treachery  that could be perpetrated without
risk of his general character   he has no feeling for others 
those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin 
he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction 
he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion 
oh  he is black at heart  hollow and black  

anne s astonished air  and exclamation of wonder  made her pause 
and in a calmer manner  she added 

 my expressions startle you   you must allow for an injured  angry woman 
but i will try to command myself   i will not abuse him 
i will only tell you what i have found him   facts shall speak 
he was the intimate friend of my dear husband  who trusted and loved him 
and thought him as good as himself   the intimacy had been formed
before our marriage   i found them most intimate friends  and i  too 
became excessively pleased with mr elliot  and entertained
the highest opinion of him   at nineteen  you know  one does not
think very seriously  but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others 
and much more agreeable than most others  and we were almost
always together   we were principally in town  living in very good style 
he was then the inferior in circumstances  he was then the poor one 
he had chambers in the temple  and it was as much as he could do
to support the appearance of a gentleman   he had always a home
with us whenever he chose it  he was always welcome  he was like a brother 
my poor charles  who had the finest  most generous spirit in the world 
would have divided his last farthing with him  and i know that his purse
was open to him  i know that he often assisted him  

 this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life  
said anne   which has always excited my particular curiosity 
it must have been about the same time that he became known to
my father and sister   i never knew him myself  i only heard of him 
but there was a something in his conduct then  with regard to
my father and sister  and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage 
which i never could quite reconcile with present times   it seemed
to announce a different sort of man  

 i know it all  i know it all   cried mrs smith    he had been
introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him 
but i heard him speak of them for ever   i know he was invited
and encouraged  and i know he did not choose to go   i can satisfy you 
perhaps  on points which you would little expect  and as to his marriage 
i knew all about it at the time   i was privy to all the fors and againsts 
i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans  and though
i did not know his wife previously  her inferior situation in society 
indeed  rendered that impossible  yet i knew her all her life afterwards 
or at least till within the last two years of her life  and can answer
any question you may wish to put  

 nay   said anne   i have no particular enquiry to make about her 
i have always understood they were not a happy couple   but i should
like to know why  at that time of his life  he should slight
my father s acquaintance as he did   my father was certainly disposed
to take very kind and proper notice of him   why did mr elliot draw back  

 mr elliot   replied mrs smith   at that period of his life 
had one object in view   to make his fortune  and by a rather quicker
process than the law   he was determined to make it by marriage 
he was determined  at least  not to mar it by an imprudent marriage 
and i know it was his belief  whether justly or not  of course
i cannot decide   that your father and sister  in their civilities
and invitations  were designing a match between the heir
and the young lady  and it was impossible that such a match
should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence 
that was his motive for drawing back  i can assure you 
he told me the whole story   he had no concealments with me 
it was curious  that having just left you behind me in bath 
my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin 
and that  through him  i should be continually hearing of your father
and sister   he described one miss elliot  and i thought
very affectionately of the other  

 perhaps   cried anne  struck by a sudden idea   you sometimes
spoke of me to mr elliot  

 to be sure i did  very often   i used to boast of my own anne elliot 
and vouch for your being a very different creature from   

she checked herself just in time 

 this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night  
cried anne    this explains it   i found he had been used to hear of me 
i could not comprehend how   what wild imaginations one forms where
dear self is concerned   how sure to be mistaken   but i beg your pardon 
i have interrupted you   mr elliot married then completely for money 
the circumstances  probably  which first opened your eyes
to his character  

mrs smith hesitated a little here    oh  those things are too common 
when one lives in the world  a man or woman s marrying for money
is too common to strike one as it ought   i was very young 
and associated only with the young  and we were a thoughtless 
gay set  without any strict rules of conduct   we lived for enjoyment 
i think differently now  time and sickness and sorrow have given me
other notions  but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible
in what mr elliot was doing    to do the best for himself  
passed as a duty  

 but was not she a very low woman  

 yes  which i objected to  but he would not regard   money  money 
was all that he wanted   her father was a grazier  her grandfather
had been a butcher  but that was all nothing   she was a fine woman 
had had a decent education  was brought forward by some cousins 
thrown by chance into mr elliot s company  and fell in love with him 
and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side 
with respect to her birth   all his caution was spent in being secured
of the real amount of her fortune  before he committed himself 
depend upon it  whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation
in life now  as a young man he had not the smallest value for it 
his chance for the kellynch estate was something  but all the honour
of the family he held as cheap as dirt   i have often heard him declare 
that if baronetcies were saleable  anybody should have his
for fifty pounds  arms and motto  name and livery included 
but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say
on that subject   it would not be fair  and yet you ought to have proof 
for what is all this but assertion  and you shall have proof  

 indeed  my dear mrs smith  i want none   cried anne    you have asserted
nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago 
this is all in confirmation  rather  of what we used to hear and believe 
i am more curious to know why he should be so different now  

 but for my satisfaction  if you will have the goodness to ring for mary 
stay   i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of
going yourself into my bedroom  and bringing me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet  

anne  seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it  did as she was desired 
the box was brought and placed before her  and mrs smith  sighing over it
as she unlocked it  said  

 this is full of papers belonging to him  to my husband 
a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him 
the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him
before our marriage  and happened to be saved  why  one can hardly imagine 
but he was careless and immethodical  like other men  about those things 
and when i came to examine his papers  i found it with others
still more trivial  from different people scattered here and there 
while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed 
here it is  i would not burn it  because being even then very little
satisfied with mr elliot  i was determined to preserve every document
of former intimacy   i have now another motive for being glad
that i can produce it  

this was the letter  directed to  charles smith  esq  tunbridge wells  
and dated from london  as far back as july  1803    

 dear smith   i have received yours   your kindness almost overpowers me 
i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common  but i have
lived three and twenty years in the world  and have seen none like it 
at present  believe me  i have no need of your services 
being in cash again   give me joy   i have got rid of sir walter and miss 
they are gone back to kellynch  and almost made me swear to visit them
this summer  but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor 
to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer 
the baronet  nevertheless  is not unlikely to marry again 
he is quite fool enough   if he does  however  they will leave me in peace 
which may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion   he is worse
than last year 

 i wish i had any name but elliot   i am sick of it   the name of walter
i can drop  thank god  and i desire you will never insult me
with my second w  again  meaning  for the rest of my life 
to be only yours truly   wm  elliot  

such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow 
and mrs smith  observing the high colour in her face  said  

 the language  i know  is highly disrespectful   though i have forgot
the exact terms  i have a perfect impression of the general meaning 
but it shows you the man   mark his professions to my poor husband 
can any thing be stronger  

anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification
of finding such words applied to her father   she was obliged to recollect
that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour 
that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies 
that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others 
before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter
which she had been meditating over  and say  

 thank you   this is full proof undoubtedly  proof of every thing
you were saying   but why be acquainted with us now  

 i can explain this too   cried mrs smith  smiling 

 can you really  

 yes   i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago 
and i will shew him as he is now   i cannot produce written proof again 
but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire  of what
he is now wanting  and what he is now doing   he is no hypocrite now 
he truly wants to marry you   his present attentions to your family
are very sincere   quite from the heart   i will give you my authority 
his friend colonel wallis  

 colonel wallis  you are acquainted with him  

 no   it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that 
it takes a bend or two  but nothing of consequence   the stream
is as good as at first  the little rubbish it collects in the turnings
is easily moved away   mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis
of his views on you  which said colonel wallis  i imagine to be 
in himself  a sensible  careful  discerning sort of character 
but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife  to whom
he tells things which he had better not  and he repeats it all to her 
she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery  repeats it all
to her nurse  and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you 
very naturally brings it all to me   on monday evening  my good friend
mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings 
when i talked of a whole history  therefore  you see i was
not romancing so much as you supposed  

 my dear mrs smith  your authority is deficient   this will not do 
mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account
for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father 
that was all prior to my coming to bath   i found them on
the most friendly terms when i arrived  

 i know you did  i know it all perfectly  but   

 indeed  mrs smith  we must not expect to get real information
in such a line   facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands
of so many  to be misconceived by folly in one  and ignorance in another 
can hardly have much truth left  

 only give me a hearing   you will soon be able to judge of
the general credit due  by listening to some particulars
which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm 
nobody supposes that you were his first inducement   he had seen you
indeed  before he came to bath  and admired you  but without
knowing it to be you   so says my historian  at least   is this true 
did he see you last summer or autumn   somewhere down in the west  
to use her own words  without knowing it to be you  

 he certainly did   so far it is very true   at lyme 
i happened to be at lyme  

 well   continued mrs smith  triumphantly   grant my friend the credit
due to the establishment of the first point asserted   he saw you then
at lyme  and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased
to meet with you again in camden place  as miss anne elliot 
and from that moment  i have no doubt  had a double motive
in his visits there   but there was another  and an earlier 
which i will now explain   if there is anything in my story which you know
to be either false or improbable  stop me   my account states 
that your sister s friend  the lady now staying with you 
whom i have heard you mention  came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter
as long ago as september  in short when they first came themselves  
and has been staying there ever since  that she is a clever  insinuating 
handsome woman  poor and plausible  and altogether such in situation
and manner  as to give a general idea  among sir walter s acquaintance 
of her meaning to be lady elliot  and as general a surprise
that miss elliot should be apparently  blind to the danger  

here mrs smith paused a moment  but anne had not a word to say 
and she continued  

 this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family 
long before you returned to it  and colonel wallis had his eye
upon your father enough to be sensible of it  though he did not then
visit in camden place  but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest
in watching all that was going on there  and when mr elliot came to bath
for a day or two  as he happened to do a little before christmas 
colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things 
and the reports beginning to prevail   now you are to understand 
that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions
as to the value of a baronetcy   upon all points of blood and connexion
he is a completely altered man   having long had as much money
as he could spend  nothing to wish for on the side of avarice
or indulgence  he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness
upon the consequence he is heir to   i thought it coming on
before our acquaintance ceased  but it is now a confirmed feeling 
he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william   you may guess 
therefore  that the news he heard from his friend could not be
very agreeable  and you may guess what it produced  the resolution
of coming back to bath as soon as possible  and of fixing himself here
for a time  with the view of renewing his former acquaintance 
and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means
of ascertaining the degree of his danger  and of circumventing the lady
if he found it material   this was agreed upon between the two friends
as the only thing to be done  and colonel wallis was to assist
in every way that he could   he was to be introduced  and mrs wallis
was to be introduced  and everybody was to be introduced 
mr elliot came back accordingly  and on application was forgiven 
as you know  and re admitted into the family  and there it was
his constant object  and his only object  till your arrival
added another motive   to watch sir walter and mrs clay 
he omitted no opportunity of being with them  threw himself in their way 
called at all hours  but i need not be particular on this subject 
you can imagine what an artful man would do  and with this guide 
perhaps  may recollect what you have seen him do  

 yes   said anne   you tell me nothing which does not accord with
what i have known  or could imagine   there is always something offensive
in the details of cunning   the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity
must ever be revolting  but i have heard nothing which really surprises me 
i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot 
who would have difficulty in believing it  but i have never been satisfied 
i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared 
i should like to know his present opinion  as to the probability
of the event he has been in dread of  whether he considers the danger
to be lessening or not  

 lessening  i understand   replied mrs smith    he thinks mrs clay
afraid of him  aware that he sees through her  and not daring to proceed
as she might do in his absence   but since he must be absent
some time or other  i do not perceive how he can ever be secure
while she holds her present influence   mrs wallis has an amusing idea 
as nurse tells me  that it is to be put into the marriage articles
when you and mr elliot marry  that your father is not to marry mrs clay 
a scheme  worthy of mrs wallis s understanding  by all accounts 
but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it    why  to be sure 
ma am   said she   it would not prevent his marrying anybody else  
and  indeed  to own the truth  i do not think nurse  in her heart 
is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match 
she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony  you know 
and  since self will intrude  who can say that she may not have
some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot  through
mrs wallis s recommendation  

 i am very glad to know all this   said anne  after a little
thoughtfulness    it will be more painful to me in some respects
to be in company with him  but i shall know better what to do 
my line of conduct will be more direct   mr elliot is evidently
a disingenuous  artificial  worldly man  who has never had
any better principle to guide him than selfishness  

but mr elliot was not done with   mrs smith had been carried away
from her first direction  and anne had forgotten  in the interest
of her own family concerns  how much had been originally implied
against him  but her attention was now called to the explanation
of those first hints  and she listened to a recital which 
if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith 
proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her 
very deficient both in justice and compassion 

she learned that  the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired
by mr elliot s marriage  they had been as before always together 
and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune 
mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself  and was most tender
of throwing any on her husband  but anne could collect that their income
had never been equal to their style of living  and that from the first
there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance 
from his wife s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been
a man of warm feelings  easy temper  careless habits  and not strong
understanding  much more amiable than his friend  and very unlike him 
led by him  and probably despised by him   mr elliot  raised by
his marriage to great affluence  and disposed to every gratification
of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself 
 for with all his self indulgence he had become a prudent man  
and beginning to be rich  just as his friend ought to have found himself
to be poor  seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend s
probable finances  but  on the contrary  had been prompting and
encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin  and the smiths
accordingly had been ruined 

the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it 
they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship
of their friends  and to prove that mr elliot s had better not be tried 
but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs
was fully known   with a confidence in mr elliot s regard 
more creditable to his feelings than his judgement  mr smith had
appointed him the executor of his will  but mr elliot would not act 
and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her 
in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation  had been such
as could not be related without anguish of spirit  or listened to
without corresponding indignation 

anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion  answers to
urgent applications from mrs smith  which all breathed the same
stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble  and 
under a cold civility  the same hard hearted indifference
to any of the evils it might bring on her   it was a dreadful picture
of ingratitude and inhumanity  and anne felt  at some moments 
that no flagrant open crime could have been worse   she had a great deal
to listen to  all the particulars of past sad scenes  all the minutiae
of distress upon distress  which in former conversations had been
merely hinted at  were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence 
anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief  and was only
the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend s
usual state of mind 

there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances
of particular irritation   she had good reason to believe that
some property of her husband in the west indies  which had been
for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment
of its own incumbrances  might be recoverable by proper measures 
and this property  though not large  would be enough to make
her comparatively rich   but there was nobody to stir in it 
mr elliot would do nothing  and she could do nothing herself 
equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of
bodily weakness  and from employing others by her want of money 
she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel 
and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law 
this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means 
to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances 
that a little trouble in the right place might do it 
and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims 
was hard to bear 

it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne s good offices
with mr elliot   she had previously  in the anticipation
of their marriage  been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it 
but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature 
since he did not even know her to be in bath  it immediately occurred 
that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman
he loved  and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne s feelings 
as far as the observances due to mr elliot s character would allow 
when anne s refutation of the supposed engagement changed
the face of everything  and while it took from her the new formed hope
of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety  left her at least
the comfort of telling the whole story her own way 

after listening to this full description of mr elliot  anne could not but
express some surprise at mrs smith s having spoken of him so favourably
in the beginning of their conversation    she had seemed to recommend
and praise him  

 my dear   was mrs smith s reply   there was nothing else to be done 
i considered your marrying him as certain  though he might not yet
have made the offer  and i could no more speak the truth of him 
than if he had been your husband   my heart bled for you 
as i talked of happiness  and yet he is sensible  he is agreeable 
and with such a woman as you  it was not absolutely hopeless 
he was very unkind to his first wife   they were wretched together 
but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect  and he had never loved her 
i was willing to hope that you must fare better  

anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility
of having been induced to marry him  as made her shudder at the idea
of the misery which must have followed   it was just possible that
she might have been persuaded by lady russell   and under such
a supposition  which would have been most miserable  when time had
disclosed all  too late 

it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived 
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference 
which carried them through the greater part of the morning 
was  that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend
everything relative to mrs smith  in which his conduct was involved 



chapter 22


anne went home to think over all that she had heard   in one point 
her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot 
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him   he stood as
opposed to captain wentworth  in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness 
and the evil of his attentions last night  the irremediable mischief
he might have done  was considered with sensations unqualified  unperplexed 
pity for him was all over   but this was the only point of relief 
in every other respect  in looking around her  or penetrating forward 
she saw more to distrust and to apprehend   she was concerned
for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling 
for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister 
and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils  without knowing
how to avert any one of them   she was most thankful for her own
knowledge of him   she had never considered herself as entitled to reward
for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith  but here was
a reward indeed springing from it   mrs smith had been able to tell her
what no one else could have done   could the knowledge have
been extended through her family   but this was a vain idea 
she must talk to lady russell  tell her  consult with her 
and having done her best  wait the event with as much composure
as possible  and after all  her greatest want of composure would be
in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell 
in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself 


she found  on reaching home  that she had  as she intended 
escaped seeing mr elliot  that he had called and paid them
a long morning visit  but hardly had she congratulated herself 
and felt safe  when she heard that he was coming again in the evening 

 i had not the smallest intention of asking him   said elizabeth 
with affected carelessness   but he gave so many hints 
so mrs clay says  at least  

 indeed  i do say it   i never saw anybody in my life spell harder
for an invitation   poor man   i was really in pain for him 
for your hard hearted sister  miss anne  seems bent on cruelty  

 oh   cried elizabeth   i have been rather too much used to the game
to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints   however  when i found
how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father
this morning  i gave way immediately  for i would never really omit
an opportunity of bring him and sir walter together   they appear to
so much advantage in company with each other   each behaving so pleasantly 
mr elliot looking up with so much respect  

 quite delightful   cried mrs clay  not daring  however 
to turn her eyes towards anne    exactly like father and son 
dear miss elliot  may i not say father and son  

 oh  i lay no embargo on any body s words   if you will have such
ideas   but  upon my word  i am scarcely sensible of his attentions
being beyond those of other men  

 my dear miss elliot   exclaimed mrs clay  lifting her hands and eyes 
and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence 

 well  my dear penelope  you need not be so alarmed about him 
i did invite him  you know   i sent him away with smiles 
when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park
for the whole day to morrow  i had compassion on him  

anne admired the good acting of the friend  in being able to shew
such pleasure as she did  in the expectation and in the actual arrival
of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with
her prime object   it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate
the sight of mr elliot  and yet she could assume a most obliging 
placid look  and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license
of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have
done otherwise 

to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room 
and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her 
she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere 
but now she saw insincerity in everything   his attentive deference
to her father  contrasted with his former language  was odious 
and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith 
she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness 
or the sound of his artificial good sentiments 

she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke
a remonstrance on his side   it was a great object to her to escape
all enquiry or eclat  but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool
to him as might be compatible with their relationship  and to retrace 
as quietly as she could  the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had
been gradually led along   she was accordingly more guarded 
and more cool  than she had been the night before 

he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where
he could have heard her formerly praised  wanted very much
to be gratified by more solicitation  but the charm was broken 
he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary
to kindle his modest cousin s vanity  he found  at least  that it was
not to be done now  by any of those attempts which he could hazard
among the too commanding claims of the others   he little surmised
that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest 
bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct
which were least excusable 

she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath
the next morning  going early  and that he would be gone the greater part
of two days   he was invited again to camden place the very evening of
his return  but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain 
it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her 
but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party 
seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort 
it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised
on her father and elizabeth  to consider the various sources
of mortification preparing for them   mrs clay s selfishness was
not so complicate nor so revolting as his  and anne would have compounded
for the marriage at once  with all its evils  to be clear of mr elliot s
subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it 

on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell 
and accomplish the necessary communication  and she would have gone
directly after breakfast  but that mrs clay was also going out
on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble  which
determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion 
she saw mrs clay fairly off  therefore  before she began to talk
of spending the morning in rivers street 

 very well   said elizabeth   i have nothing to send but my love 
oh  you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me 
and pretend i have read it through   i really cannot be plaguing myself
for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out 
lady russell quite bores one with her new publications 
you need not tell her so  but i thought her dress hideous the other night 
i used to think she had some taste in dress  but i was ashamed of her
at the concert   something so formal and arrange in her air 
and she sits so upright   my best love  of course  

 and mine   added sir walter    kindest regards   and you may say 
that i mean to call upon her soon   make a civil message 
but i shall only leave my card   morning visits are never fair
by women at her time of life  who make themselves up so little 
if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen 
but last time i called  i observed the blinds were let down immediately  

while her father spoke  there was a knock at the door   who could it be 
anne  remembering the preconcerted visits  at all hours  of mr elliot 
would have expected him  but for his known engagement seven miles off 
after the usual period of suspense  the usual sounds of approach were heard 
and  mr and mrs charles musgrove  were ushered into the room 

surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance 
but anne was really glad to see them  and the others were not so sorry
but that they could put on a decent air of welcome  and as soon
as it became clear that these  their nearest relations  were not arrived
with an views of accommodation in that house  sir walter and elizabeth
were able to rise in cordiality  and do the honours of it very well 
they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove  and were
at the white hart   so much was pretty soon understood 
but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into
the other drawing room  and regaling themselves with her admiration 
anne could not draw upon charles s brain for a regular history
of their coming  or an explanation of some smiling hints
of particular business  which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary 
as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of 

she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove  henrietta 
and captain harville  beside their two selves   he gave her a very plain 
intelligible account of the whole  a narration in which she saw
a great deal of most characteristic proceeding   the scheme
had received its first impulse by captain harville s wanting to
come to bath on business   he had begun to talk of it a week ago 
and by way of doing something  as shooting was over  charles had proposed
coming with him  and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it
very much  as an advantage to her husband  but mary could not bear
to be left  and had made herself so unhappy about it  that for a day or two
everything seemed to be in suspense  or at an end   but then 
it had been taken up by his father and mother   his mother had
some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see  it was thought
a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding clothes
for herself and her sister  and  in short  it ended in being
his mother s party  that everything might be comfortable and easy
to captain harville  and he and mary were included in it
by way of general convenience   they had arrived late the night before 
mrs harville  her children  and captain benwick  remained with
mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross 

anne s only surprise was  that affairs should be in forwardness enough
for henrietta s wedding clothes to be talked of   she had imagined
such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent
the marriage from being near at hand  but she learned from charles that 
very recently   since mary s last letter to herself   charles hayter
had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth
who could not possibly claim it under many years  and that
on the strength of his present income  with almost a certainty
of something more permanent long before the term in question 
the two families had consented to the young people s wishes 
and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months 
quite as soon as louisa s    and a very good living it was  
charles added    only five and twenty miles from uppercross 
and in a very fine country    fine part of dorsetshire 
in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom 
surrounded by three great proprietors  each more careful and jealous
than the other  and to two of the three at least  charles hayter might get
a special recommendation   not that he will value it as he ought  
he observed   charles is too cool about sporting  that s the worst of him  

 i am extremely glad  indeed   cried anne   particularly glad
that this should happen  and that of two sisters  who both deserve
equally well  and who have always been such good friends 
the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other  
that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort 
i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both  

 oh  yes   my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer 
but he has no other fault to find   money  you know  coming down with
money  two daughters at once  it cannot be a very agreeable operation 
and it streightens him as to many things   however  i do not mean to say
they have not a right to it   it is very fit they should have
daughters  shares  and i am sure he has always been a very kind 
liberal father to me   mary does not above half like henrietta s match 
she never did  you know   but she does not do him justice 
nor think enough about winthrop   i cannot make her attend to
the value of the property   it is a very fair match  as times go 
and i have liked charles hayter all my life  and i shall not leave off now  

 such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove   exclaimed anne 
 should be happy in their children s marriages   they do everything
to confer happiness  i am sure   what a blessing to young people
to be in such hands   your father and mother seem so totally free
from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct
and misery  both in young and old   i hope you think louisa
perfectly recovered now  

he answered rather hesitatingly   yes  i believe i do  very much recovered 
but she is altered  there is no running or jumping about  no laughing
or dancing  it is quite different   if one happens only to shut the door
a little hard  she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water 
and benwick sits at her elbow  reading verses  or whispering to her 
all day long  

anne could not help laughing    that cannot be much to your taste 
i know   said she   but i do believe him to be an excellent young man  

 to be sure he is   nobody doubts it  and i hope you do not think
i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and
pleasures as myself   i have a great value for benwick  and when one can
but get him to talk  he has plenty to say   his reading has done him
no harm  for he has fought as well as read   he is a brave fellow 
i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before 
we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in
my father s great barns  and he played his part so well
that i have liked him the better ever since  

here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles s
following the others to admire mirrors and china  but anne had
heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross 
and rejoice in its happiness  and though she sighed as she rejoiced 
her sigh had none of the ill will of envy in it   she would certainly
have risen to their blessings if she could  but she did not want
to lessen theirs 

the visit passed off altogether in high good humour   mary was
in excellent spirits  enjoying the gaiety and the change 
and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law s carriage
with four horses  and with her own complete independence of camden place 
that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought 
and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house 
as they were detailed to her   she had no demands on her father or sister 
and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome
drawing rooms 

elizabeth was  for a short time  suffering a good deal 
she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked
to dine with them  but she could not bear to have the difference of style 
the reduction of servants  which a dinner must betray  witnessed by those
who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch 
it was a struggle between propriety and vanity  but vanity got the better 
and then elizabeth was happy again   these were her internal persuasions 
 old fashioned notions  country hospitality  we do not profess
to give dinners  few people in bath do  lady alicia never does 
did not even ask her own sister s family  though they were here a month 
and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove 
put her quite out of her way   i am sure she would rather not come 
she cannot feel easy with us   i will ask them all for an evening 
that will be much better  that will be a novelty and a treat 
they have not seen two such drawing rooms before   they will be delighted
to come to morrow evening   it shall be a regular party  small 
but most elegant    and this satisfied elizabeth   and when the invitation
was given to the two present  and promised for the absent 
mary was as completely satisfied   she was particularly asked
to meet mr elliot  and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret 
who were fortunately already engaged to come  and she could not
have received a more gratifying attention   miss elliot was to have
the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning 
and anne walked off with charles and mary  to go and see her
and henrietta directly 

her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present 
they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes 
but anne convinced herself that a day s delay of the intended communication
could be of no consequence  and hastened forward to the white hart 
to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn 
with an eagerness of good will which many associations contributed to form 

they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within  and by themselves 
and anne had the kindest welcome from each   henrietta was exactly
in that state of recently improved views  of fresh formed happiness 
which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had
ever liked before at all  and mrs musgrove s real affection had been won
by her usefulness when they were in distress   it was a heartiness 
and a warmth  and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more 
from the sad want of such blessings at home   she was entreated
to give them as much of her time as possible  invited for every day
and all day long  or rather claimed as part of the family  and  in return 
she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance 
and on charles s leaving them together  was listening to mrs musgrove s
history of louisa  and to henrietta s of herself  giving opinions
on business  and recommendations to shops  with intervals of every help
which mary required  from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts 
from finding her keys  and assorting her trinkets  to trying
to convince her that she was not ill used by anybody  which mary 
well amused as she generally was  in her station at a window
overlooking the entrance to the pump room  could not but have
her moments of imagining 

a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected   a large party
in an hotel ensured a quick changing  unsettled scene   one five minutes
brought a note  the next a parcel  and anne had not been there
half an hour  when their dining room  spacious as it was 
seemed more than half filled   a party of steady old friends
were seated around mrs musgrove  and charles came back with
captains harville and wentworth   the appearance of the latter
could not be more than the surprise of the moment   it was impossible
for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their
common friends must be soon bringing them together again 
their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings 
she had derived from it a delightful conviction  but she feared
from his looks  that the same unfortunate persuasion  which had
hastened him away from the concert room  still governed 
he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation 

she tried to be calm  and leave things to take their course 
and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence   
 surely  if there be constant attachment on each side  our hearts
must understand each other ere long   we are not boy and girl 
to be captiously irritable  misled by every moment s inadvertence 
and wantonly playing with our own happiness    and yet 
a few minutes afterwards  she felt as if their being in company
with each other  under their present circumstances  could only be
exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most
mischievous kind 

 anne   cried mary  still at her window   there is mrs clay 
i am sure  standing under the colonnade  and a gentleman with her 
i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now   they seemed
deep in talk   who is it   come  and tell me   good heavens  i recollect 
it is mr elliot himself  

 no   cried anne  quickly   it cannot be mr elliot  i assure you 
he was to leave bath at nine this morning  and does not come back
till to morrow  

as she spoke  she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her 
the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her  and made her regret
that she had said so much  simple as it was 

mary  resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin 
began talking very warmly about the family features  and protesting
still more positively that it was mr elliot  calling again upon anne
to come and look for herself  but anne did not mean to stir 
and tried to be cool and unconcerned   her distress returned 
however  on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between
two or three of the lady visitors  as if they believed themselves
quite in the secret   it was evident that the report concerning her
had spread  and a short pause succeeded  which seemed to ensure
that it would now spread farther 

 do come  anne  cried mary   come and look yourself   you will be too late
if you do not make haste   they are parting  they are shaking hands 
he is turning away   not know mr elliot  indeed   you seem to have
forgot all about lyme  

to pacify mary  and perhaps screen her own embarrassment 
anne did move quietly to the window   she was just in time to ascertain
that it really was mr elliot  which she had never believed 
before he disappeared on one side  as mrs clay walked quickly off
on the other  and checking the surprise which she could not but feel
at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons
of totally opposite interest  she calmly said   yes  it is mr elliot 
certainly   he has changed his hour of going  i suppose  that is all 
or i may be mistaken  i might not attend   and walked back to her chair 
recomposed  and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well 

the visitors took their leave  and charles  having civilly seen them off 
and then made a face at them  and abused them for coming  began with  

 well  mother  i have done something for you that you will like 
i have been to the theatre  and secured a box for to morrow night 
a n t i a good boy   i know you love a play  and there is room for us all 
it holds nine   i have engaged captain wentworth   anne will
not be sorry to join us  i am sure   we all like a play 
have not i done well  mother  

mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness
for the play  if henrietta and all the others liked it  when mary
eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming  

 good heavens  charles  how can you think of such a thing 
take a box for to morrow night   have you forgot that we are engaged
to camden place to morrow night  and that we were most particularly asked
to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter  and mr elliot  and all
the principal family connexions  on purpose to be introduced to them 
how can you be so forgetful  

 phoo  phoo   replied charles   what s an evening party 
never worth remembering   your father might have asked us to dinner 
i think  if he had wanted to see us   you may do as you like 
but i shall go to the play  

 oh  charles  i declare it will be too abominable if you do 
when you promised to go  

 no  i did not promise   i only smirked and bowed  and said the word
 happy    there was no promise  

 but you must go  charles   it would be unpardonable to fail 
we were asked on purpose to be introduced   there was always
such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves 
nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately 
we are quite near relations  you know  and mr elliot too 
whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with   every attention
is due to mr elliot   consider  my father s heir   the future
representative of the family  

 don t talk to me about heirs and representatives   cried charles 
 i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow
to the rising sun   if i would not go for the sake of your father 
i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir 
what is mr elliot to me    the careless expression was life to anne 
who saw that captain wentworth was all attention  looking and
listening with his whole soul  and that the last words brought
his enquiring eyes from charles to herself 

charles and mary still talked on in the same style  he  half serious
and half jesting  maintaining the scheme for the play  and she 
invariably serious  most warmly opposing it  and not omitting
to make it known that  however determined to go to camden place herself 
she should not think herself very well used  if they went to the play
without her   mrs musgrove interposed 

 we had better put it off   charles  you had much better go back
and change the box for tuesday   it would be a pity to be divided 
and we should be losing miss anne  too  if there is a party at her father s 
and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play 
if miss anne could not be with us  

anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness  and quite as much
so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying  

 if it depended only on my inclination  ma am  the party at home
 excepting on mary s account  would not be the smallest impediment 
i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting  and should be too happy
to change it for a play  and with you   but  it had better
not be attempted  perhaps    she had spoken it  but she trembled
when it was done  conscious that her words were listened to 
and daring not even to try to observe their effect 

it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day 
charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife 
by persisting that he would go to the play to morrow if nobody else would 

captain wentworth left his seat  and walked to the fire place 
probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards 
and taking a station  with less bare faced design  by anne 

 you have not been long enough in bath   said he   to enjoy
the evening parties of the place  

 oh  no   the usual character of them has nothing for me 
i am no card player  

 you were not formerly  i know   you did not use to like cards 
but time makes many changes  

 i am not yet so much changed   cried anne  and stopped  fearing she
hardly knew what misconstruction   after waiting a few moments
he said  and as if it were the result of immediate feeling 
 it is a period  indeed   eight years and a half is a period  

whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne s imagination
to ponder over in a calmer hour  for while still hearing the sounds
he had uttered  she was startled to other subjects by henrietta 
eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out 
and calling on her companions to lose no time  lest somebody else
should come in 

they were obliged to move   anne talked of being perfectly ready 
and tried to look it  but she felt that could henrietta have known
the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair 
in preparing to quit the room  she would have found  in all her own
sensations for her cousin  in the very security of his affection 
wherewith to pity her 

their preparations  however  were stopped short   alarming sounds
were heard  other visitors approached  and the door was thrown open
for sir walter and miss elliot  whose entrance seemed to give
a general chill   anne felt an instant oppression  and wherever she looked
saw symptoms of the same   the comfort  the freedom  the gaiety
of the room was over  hushed into cold composure  determined silence 
or insipid talk  to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister 
how mortifying to feel that it was so 

her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular   captain wentworth
was acknowledged again by each  by elizabeth more graciously than before 
she even addressed him once  and looked at him more than once 
elizabeth was  in fact  revolving a great measure   the sequel
explained it   after the waste of a few minutes in saying
the proper nothings  she began to give the invitation which
was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves 
 to morrow evening  to meet a few friends   no formal party  
it was all said very gracefully  and the cards with which she had
provided herself  the  miss elliot at home   were laid on the table 
with a courteous  comprehensive smile to all  and one smile and
one card more decidedly for captain wentworth   the truth was 
that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand
the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his 
the past was nothing   the present was that captain wentworth
would move about well in her drawing room   the card was pointedly given 
and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared 

the interruption had been short  though severe  and ease and animation
returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out 
but not to anne   she could think only of the invitation she had
with such astonishment witnessed  and of the manner in which
it had been received  a manner of doubtful meaning  of surprise rather
than gratification  of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance 
she knew him  she saw disdain in his eye  and could not venture to believe
that he had determined to accept such an offering  as an atonement
for all the insolence of the past   her spirits sank   he held the card
in his hand after they were gone  as if deeply considering it 

 only think of elizabeth s including everybody   whispered mary
very audibly    i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted 
you see he cannot put the card out of his hand  

anne caught his eye  saw his cheeks glow  and his mouth form itself
into a momentary expression of contempt  and turned away 
that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her 

the party separated   the gentlemen had their own pursuits 
the ladies proceeded on their own business  and they met no more while
anne belonged to them   she was earnestly begged to return and dine 
and give them all the rest of the day  but her spirits had been
so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more 
and fit only for home  where she might be sure of being as silent
as she chose 

promising to be with them the whole of the following morning  therefore 
she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place 
there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements
of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow s party  the frequent enumeration
of the persons invited  and the continually improving detail of all
the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant
of its kind in bath  while harassing herself with the never ending
question  of whether captain wentworth would come or not   they were
reckoning him as certain  but with her it was a gnawing solicitude
never appeased for five minutes together   she generally thought
he would come  because she generally thought he ought  but it was a case
which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion 
as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings 

she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation 
to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot
three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath 
for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview
from the lady herself  she determined to mention it  and it seemed to her
there was guilt in mrs clay s face as she listened   it was transient 
cleared away in an instant  but anne could imagine she read there
the consciousness of having  by some complication of mutual trick 
or some overbearing authority of his  been obliged to attend
 perhaps for half an hour  to his lectures and restrictions on her designs
on sir walter   she exclaimed  however  with a very tolerable
imitation of nature    

 oh  dear  very true   only think  miss elliot  to my great surprise
i met with mr elliot in bath street   i was never more astonished 
he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard   he had been prevented
setting off for thornberry  but i really forget by what 
for i was in a hurry  and could not much attend  and i can only answer
for his being determined not to be delayed in his return 
he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to morrow 
he was full of  to morrow   and it is very evident that i have been
full of it too  ever since i entered the house  and learnt the extension
of your plan and all that had happened  or my seeing him could never have
gone so entirely out of my head  



chapter 23


one day only had passed since anne s conversation with mrs smith 
but a keener interest had succeeded  and she was now so little touched
by mr elliot s conduct  except by its effects in one quarter 
that it became a matter of course the next morning  still to defer
her explanatory visit in rivers street   she had promised to be
with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner   her faith was plighted 
and mr elliot s character  like the sultaness scheherazade s head 
must live another day 

she could not keep her appointment punctually  however 
the weather was unfavourable  and she had grieved over the rain
on her friends  account  and felt it very much on her own 
before she was able to attempt the walk   when she reached the white hart 
and made her way to the proper apartment  she found herself
neither arriving quite in time  nor the first to arrive 
the party before her were  mrs musgrove  talking to mrs croft 
and captain harville to captain wentworth  and she immediately heard
that mary and henrietta  too impatient to wait  had gone out the moment
it had cleared  but would be back again soon  and that the strictest
injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there
till they returned   she had only to submit  sit down 
be outwardly composed  and feel herself plunged at once
in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of
tasting a little before the morning closed   there was no delay 
no waste of time   she was deep in the happiness of such misery 
or the misery of such happiness  instantly   two minutes after
her entering the room  captain wentworth said  

 we will write the letter we were talking of  harville  now 
if you will give me materials  

materials were at hand  on a separate table  he went to it 
and nearly turning his back to them all  was engrossed by writing 

mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest
daughter s engagement  and just in that inconvenient tone of voice
which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper 
anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation  and yet 
as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk 
she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars  such as 
 how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again
to talk it over  what my brother hayter had said one day 
and what mr musgrove had proposed the next  and what had occurred
to my sister hayter  and what the young people had wished  and what
i said at first i never could consent to  but was afterwards persuaded
to think might do very well   and a great deal in the same style
of open hearted communication   minutiae which  even with every advantage
of taste and delicacy  which good mrs musgrove could not give 
could be properly interesting only to the principals   mrs croft
was attending with great good humour  and whenever she spoke at all 
it was very sensibly   anne hoped the gentlemen might each be
too much self occupied to hear 

 and so  ma am  all these thing considered   said mrs musgrove 
in her powerful whisper   though we could have wished it different 
yet  altogether  we did not think it fair to stand out any longer 
for charles hayter was quite wild about it  and henrietta was
pretty near as bad  and so we thought they had better marry at once 
and make the best of it  as many others have done before them 
at any rate  said i  it will be better than a long engagement  

 that is precisely what i was going to observe   cried mrs croft 
 i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once 
and have to struggle with a few difficulties together  than be
involved in a long engagement   i always think that no mutual   

 oh  dear mrs croft   cried mrs musgrove  unable to let her
finish her speech   there is nothing i so abominate for young people
as a long engagement   it is what i always protested against
for my children   it is all very well  i used to say  for young people
to be engaged  if there is a certainty of their being able to marry
in six months  or even in twelve  but a long engagement   

 yes  dear ma am   said mrs croft   or an uncertain engagement 
an engagement which may be long   to begin without knowing
that at such a time there will be the means of marrying 
i hold to be very unsafe and unwise  and what i think all parents
should prevent as far as they can  

anne found an unexpected interest here   she felt its application
to herself  felt it in a nervous thrill all over her  and at the same
moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table 
captain wentworth s pen ceased to move  his head was raised  pausing 
listening  and he turned round the next instant to give a look 
one quick  conscious look at her 

the two ladies continued to talk  to re urge the same admitted truths 
and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of
a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation 
but anne heard nothing distinctly  it was only a buzz of words in her ear 
her mind was in confusion 

captain harville  who had in truth been hearing none of it 
now left his seat  and moved to a window  and anne seeming to watch him 
though it was from thorough absence of mind  became gradually sensible
that he was inviting her to join him where he stood   he looked at her
with a smile  and a little motion of the head  which expressed 
 come to me  i have something to say   and the unaffected 
easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance
than he really was  strongly enforced the invitation   she roused herself
and went to him   the window at which he stood was at the other end
of the room from where the two ladies were sitting  and though nearer
to captain wentworth s table  not very near   as she joined him 
captain harville s countenance re assumed the serious  thoughtful
expression which seemed its natural character 

 look here   said he  unfolding a parcel in his hand  and displaying
a small miniature painting   do you know who that is  

 certainly   captain benwick  

 yes  and you may guess who it is for   but    in a deep tone  
 it was not done for her   miss elliot  do you remember our
walking together at lyme  and grieving for him   i little thought then  
but no matter   this was drawn at the cape   he met with
a clever young german artist at the cape  and in compliance with a promise
to my poor sister  sat to him  and was bringing it home for her 
and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another 
it was a commission to me   but who else was there to employ 
i hope i can allow for him   i am not sorry  indeed  to make it
over to another   he undertakes it    looking towards captain wentworth  
 he is writing about it now    and with a quivering lip he wound up
the whole by adding   poor fanny  she would not have forgotten him so soon  

 no   replied anne  in a low  feeling voice   that i can easily believe  

 it was not in her nature   she doted on him  

 it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved  

captain harville smiled  as much as to say   do you claim that
for your sex   and she answered the question  smiling also 
 yes   we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us 
it is  perhaps  our fate rather than our merit   we cannot help ourselves 
we live at home  quiet  confined  and our feelings prey upon us 
you are forced on exertion   you have always a profession  pursuits 
business of some sort or other  to take you back into the world immediately 
and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions  

 granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men
 which  however  i do not think i shall grant   it does not apply
to benwick   he has not been forced upon any exertion   the peace
turned him on shore at the very moment  and he has been living with us 
in our little family circle  ever since  

 true   said anne   very true  i did not recollect  but what shall
we say now  captain harville   if the change be not from
outward circumstances  it must be from within  it must be nature 
man s nature  which has done the business for captain benwick  

 no  no  it is not man s nature   i will not allow it to be more
man s nature than woman s to be inconstant and forget those they do love 
or have loved   i believe the reverse   i believe in a true analogy
between our bodily frames and our mental  and that as our bodies are
the strongest  so are our feelings  capable of bearing most rough usage 
and riding out the heaviest weather  

 your feelings may be the strongest   replied anne   but the same spirit
of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender 
man is more robust than woman  but he is not longer lived 
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments 
nay  it would be too hard upon you  if it were otherwise 
you have difficulties  and privations  and dangers enough to struggle with 
you are always labouring and toiling  exposed to every risk and hardship 
your home  country  friends  all quitted   neither time  nor health 
nor life  to be called your own   it would be hard  indeed 
 with a faltering voice    if woman s feelings were to be
added to all this  

 we shall never agree upon this question   captain harville
was beginning to say  when a slight noise called their attention
to captain wentworth s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room 
it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down  but anne was
startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed  and half inclined
to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been
occupied by them  striving to catch sounds  which yet she did not think
he could have caught 

 have you finished your letter   said captain harville 

 not quite  a few lines more   i shall have done in five minutes  

 there is no hurry on my side   i am only ready whenever you are 
i am in very good anchorage here    smiling at anne    well supplied 
and want for nothing   no hurry for a signal at all   well  miss elliot  
 lowering his voice    as i was saying we shall never agree 
i suppose  upon this point   no man and woman  would  probably 
but let me observe that all histories are against you  all stories 
prose and verse   if i had such a memory as benwick  i could bring you
fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument  and i do not think
i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say
upon woman s inconstancy   songs and proverbs  all talk
of woman s fickleness   but perhaps you will say  these were all
written by men  

 perhaps i shall   yes  yes  if you please  no reference to examples
in books   men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story 
education has been theirs in so much higher a degree  the pen has
been in their hands   i will not allow books to prove anything  

 but how shall we prove anything  

 we never shall   we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point 
it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof 
we each begin  probably  with a little bias towards our own sex 
and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it
which has occurred within our own circle  many of which circumstances
 perhaps those very cases which strike us the most  may be precisely such
as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence 
or in some respect saying what should not be said  

 ah   cried captain harville  in a tone of strong feeling 
 if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes
a last look at his wife and children  and watches the boat
that he has sent them off in  as long as it is in sight 
and then turns away and says   god knows whether we ever meet again  
and then  if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does
see them again  when  coming back after a twelvemonth s absence 
perhaps  and obliged to put into another port  he calculates how soon
it be possible to get them there  pretending to deceive himself 
and saying   they cannot be here till such a day   but all the while
hoping for them twelve hours sooner  and seeing them arrive at last 
as if heaven had given them wings  by many hours sooner still 
if i could explain to you all this  and all that a man can bear and do 
and glories to do  for the sake of these treasures of his existence 
i speak  you know  only of such men as have hearts   pressing his own
with emotion 

 oh   cried anne eagerly   i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you 
and by those who resemble you   god forbid that i should undervalue
the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures 
i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment
and constancy were known only by woman   no  i believe you capable
of everything great and good in your married lives   i believe you equal
to every important exertion  and to every domestic forbearance 
so long as  if i may be allowed the expression  so long as you have
an object   i mean while the woman you love lives  and lives for you 
all the privilege i claim for my own sex  it is not a very enviable one 
you need not covet it   is that of loving longest  when existence
or when hope is gone  

she could not immediately have uttered another sentence  her heart
was too full  her breath too much oppressed 

 you are a good soul   cried captain harville  putting his hand
on her arm  quite affectionately    there is no quarrelling with you 
and when i think of benwick  my tongue is tied  

their attention was called towards the others   mrs croft was taking leave 

 here  frederick  you and i part company  i believe   said she 
 i am going home  and you have an engagement with your friend 
to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party  
 turning to anne     we had your sister s card yesterday 
and i understood frederick had a card too  though i did not see it 
and you are disengaged  frederick  are you not  as well as ourselves  

captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste  and either
could not or would not answer fully 

 yes   said he   very true  here we separate  but harville and i
shall soon be after you  that is  harville  if you are ready 
i am in half a minute   i know you will not be sorry to be off 
i shall be at your service in half a minute  

mrs croft left them  and captain wentworth  having sealed his letter
with great rapidity  was indeed ready  and had even a hurried 
agitated air  which shewed impatience to be gone   anne knew not how
to understand it   she had the kindest  good morning  god bless you  
from captain harville  but from him not a word  nor a look 
he had passed out of the room without a look 

she had only time  however  to move closer to the table where
he had been writing  when footsteps were heard returning 
the door opened  it was himself   he begged their pardon 
but he had forgotten his gloves  and instantly crossing the room
to the writing table  he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper 
placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her
for a time  and hastily collecting his gloves  was again out of the room 
almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it 
the work of an instant 

the revolution which one instant had made in anne  was almost
beyond expression   the letter  with a direction hardly legible 
to  miss a  e      was evidently the one which he had been folding
so hastily   while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick 
he had been also addressing her   on the contents of that letter
depended all which this world could do for her   anything was possible 
anything might be defied rather than suspense   mrs musgrove had
little arrangements of her own at her own table  to their protection
she must trust  and sinking into the chair which he had occupied 
succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written 
her eyes devoured the following words 


 i can listen no longer in silence   i must speak to you by such means
as are within my reach   you pierce my soul   i am half agony 
half hope   tell me not that i am too late  that such precious feelings
are gone for ever   i offer myself to you again with a heart
even more your own than when you almost broke it  eight years
and a half ago   dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman 
that his love has an earlier death   i have loved none but you 
unjust i may have been  weak and resentful i have been 
but never inconstant   you alone have brought me to bath 
for you alone  i think and plan   have you not seen this 
can you fail to have understood my wishes   i had not waited even
these ten days  could i have read your feelings  as i think you must have
penetrated mine   i can hardly write   i am every instant hearing
something which overpowers me   you sink your voice  but i can
distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others 
too good  too excellent creature   you do us justice  indeed 
you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men 
believe it to be most fervent  most undeviating  in f  w 

 i must go  uncertain of my fate  but i shall return hither 
or follow your party  as soon as possible   a word  a look 
will be enough to decide whether i enter your father s house
this evening or never  


such a letter was not to be soon recovered from   half and hour s solitude
and reflection might have tranquillized her  but the ten minutes only
which now passed before she was interrupted  with all the restraints
of her situation  could do nothing towards tranquillity   every moment
rather brought fresh agitation   it was overpowering happiness 
and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation 
charles  mary  and henrietta all came in 

the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then
an immediate struggle  but after a while she could do no more 
she began not to understand a word they said  and was obliged
to plead indisposition and excuse herself   they could then see
that she looked very ill  were shocked and concerned  and would not
stir without her for the world   this was dreadful   would they only
have gone away  and left her in the quiet possession of that room
it would have been her cure  but to have them all standing or
waiting around her was distracting  and in desperation 
she said she would go home 

 by all means  my dear   cried mrs musgrove   go home directly 
and take care of yourself  that you may be fit for the evening 
i wish sarah was here to doctor you  but i am no doctor myself 
charles  ring and order a chair   she must not walk  

but the chair would never do   worse than all   to lose the possibility
of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet 
solitary progress up the town  and she felt almost certain of meeting him 
could not be borne   the chair was earnestly protested against 
and mrs musgrove  who thought only of one sort of illness 
having assured herself with some anxiety  that there had been no fall
in the case  that anne had not at any time lately slipped down 
and got a blow on her head  that she was perfectly convinced of having
had no fall  could part with her cheerfully  and depend on
finding her better at night 

anxious to omit no possible precaution  anne struggled  and said  

 i am afraid  ma am  that it is not perfectly understood 
pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope
to see your whole party this evening   i am afraid there had been
some mistake  and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville
and captain wentworth  that we hope to see them both  

 oh  my dear  it is quite understood  i give you my word 
captain harville has no thought but of going  

 do you think so   but i am afraid  and i should be so very sorry 
will you promise me to mention it  when you see them again 
you will see them both this morning  i dare say   do promise me  

 to be sure i will  if you wish it   charles  if you see captain harville
anywhere  remember to give miss anne s message   but indeed  my dear 
you need not be uneasy   captain harville holds himself quite engaged 
i ll answer for it  and captain wentworth the same  i dare say  

anne could do no more  but her heart prophesied some mischance
to damp the perfection of her felicity   it could not be very lasting 
however   even if he did not come to camden place himself 
it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence
by captain harville   another momentary vexation occurred 
charles  in his real concern and good nature  would go home with her 
there was no preventing him   this was almost cruel   but she could not
be long ungrateful  he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith s 
to be of use to her  and she set off with him  with no feeling
but gratitude apparent 

they were on union street  when a quicker step behind  a something
of familiar sound  gave her two moments  preparation for the sight
of captain wentworth   he joined them  but  as if irresolute
whether to join or to pass on  said nothing  only looked 
anne could command herself enough to receive that look 
and not repulsively   the cheeks which had been pale now glowed 
and the movements which had hesitated were decided   he walked by her side 
presently  struck by a sudden thought  charles said  

 captain wentworth  which way are you going   only to gay street 
or farther up the town  

 i hardly know   replied captain wentworth  surprised 

 are you going as high as belmont   are you going near camden place 
because  if you are  i shall have no scruple in asking you
to take my place  and give anne your arm to her father s door 
she is rather done for this morning  and must not go so far without help 
and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place 
he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off 
said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment 
that i might see it  and if i do not turn back now  i have no chance 
by his description  a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine 
which you shot with one day round winthrop  

there could not be an objection   there could be only the most
proper alacrity  a most obliging compliance for public view 
and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture 
in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again 
and the other two proceeding together   and soon words enough had passed
between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet
and retired gravel walk  where the power of conversation would make
the present hour a blessing indeed  and prepare it for all
the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives
could bestow   there they exchanged again those feelings
and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything 
but which had been followed by so many  many years of division
and estrangement   there they returned again into the past 
more exquisitely happy  perhaps  in their re union  than when
it had been first projected  more tender  more tried  more fixed
in a knowledge of each other s character  truth  and attachment 
more equal to act  more justified in acting   and there  as they slowly
paced the gradual ascent  heedless of every group around them 
seeing neither sauntering politicians  bustling housekeepers 
flirting girls  nor nursery maids and children  they could indulge in
those retrospections and acknowledgements  and especially in
those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment 
which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest   all the little
variations of the last week were gone through  and of yesterday
and today there could scarcely be an end 

she had not mistaken him   jealousy of mr elliot had been
the retarding weight  the doubt  the torment   that had begun to operate
in the very hour of first meeting her in bath  that had returned 
after a short suspension  to ruin the concert  and that had influenced him
in everything he had said and done  or omitted to say and do 
in the last four and twenty hours   it had been gradually yielding
to the better hopes which her looks  or words  or actions
occasionally encouraged  it had been vanquished at last by
those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked
with captain harville  and under the irresistible governance of which
he had seized a sheet of paper  and poured out his feelings 

of what he had then written  nothing was to be retracted or qualified 
he persisted in having loved none but her   she had never been supplanted 
he never even believed himself to see her equal   thus much indeed
he was obliged to acknowledge   that he had been constant unconsciously 
nay unintentionally  that he had meant to forget her  and believed it
to be done   he had imagined himself indifferent  when he had only
been angry  and he had been unjust to her merits  because he had been
a sufferer from them   her character was now fixed on his mind
as perfection itself  maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude
and gentleness  but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross
had he learnt to do her justice  and only at lyme had he begun
to understand himself   at lyme  he had received lessons
of more than one sort   the passing admiration of mr elliot
had at least roused him  and the scenes on the cobb and at
captain harville s had fixed her superiority 

in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove
 the attempts of angry pride   he protested that he had for ever
felt it to be impossible  that he had not cared  could not care 
for louisa  though till that day  till the leisure for reflection
which followed it  he had not understood the perfect excellence
of the mind with which louisa s could so ill bear a comparison 
or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own 
there  he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle
and the obstinacy of self will  between the darings of heedlessness
and the resolution of a collected mind   there he had seen everything
to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost  and there begun
to deplore the pride  the folly  the madness of resentment 
which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way 

from that period his penance had become severe   he had no sooner
been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days
of louisa s accident  no sooner begun to feel himself alive again 
than he had begun to feel himself  though alive  not at liberty 

 i found   said he   that i was considered by harville an engaged man 
that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our
mutual attachment   i was startled and shocked   to a degree 
i could contradict this instantly  but  when i began to reflect
that others might have felt the same  her own family  nay 
perhaps herself  i was no longer at my own disposal   i was hers in honour
if she wished it   i had been unguarded   i had not thought seriously
on this subject before   i had not considered that my excessive intimacy
must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways  and that i had
no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls 
at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report  were there no other
ill effects   i had been grossly wrong  and must abide the consequences  

he found too late  in short  that he had entangled himself 
and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring
for louisa at all  he must regard himself as bound to her 
if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed 
it determined him to leave lyme  and await her complete recovery elsewhere 
he would gladly weaken  by any fair means  whatever feelings or
speculations concerning him might exist  and he went  therefore 
to his brother s  meaning after a while to return to kellynch 
and act as circumstances might require 

 i was six weeks with edward   said he   and saw him happy 
i could have no other pleasure   i deserved none   he enquired after you
very particularly  asked even if you were personally altered 
little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter  

anne smiled  and let it pass   it was too pleasing a blunder
for a reproach   it is something for a woman to be assured 
in her eight and twentieth year  that she has not lost one charm
of earlier youth  but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased
to anne  by comparing it with former words  and feeling it to be
the result  not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment 

he had remained in shropshire  lamenting the blindness of his own pride 
and the blunders of his own calculations  till at once released from louisa
by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement
with benwick 

 here   said he   ended the worst of my state  for now i could at least
put myself in the way of happiness  i could exert myself 
i could do something   but to be waiting so long in inaction 
and waiting only for evil  had been dreadful   within the first
five minutes i said   i will be at bath on wednesday   and i was 
was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come  and to arrive
with some degree of hope   you were single   it was possible that
you might retain the feelings of the past  as i did  and one encouragement
happened to be mine   i could never doubt that you would be loved and
sought by others  but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man 
at least  of better pretensions than myself  and i could not help
often saying   was this for me   

their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said 
but the concert still more   that evening seemed to be made up
of exquisite moments   the moment of her stepping forward
in the octagon room to speak to him   the moment of mr elliot s appearing
and tearing her away  and one or two subsequent moments 
marked by returning hope or increasing despondency  were dwelt on
with energy 

 to see you   cried he   in the midst of those who could not be
my well wishers  to see your cousin close by you  conversing and smiling 
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match 
to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope
to influence you   even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent 
to consider what powerful supports would be his   was it not enough
to make the fool of me which i appeared   how could i look on
without agony   was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you 
was not the recollection of what had been  the knowledge of her influence 
the indelible  immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done  
was it not all against me  

 you should have distinguished   replied anne    you should not have
suspected me now  the case is so different  and my age is so different 
if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once  remember that
it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety  not of risk 
when i yielded  i thought it was to duty  but no duty could be called
in aid here   in marrying a man indifferent to me  all risk
would have been incurred  and all duty violated  

 perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus   he replied   but i could not 
i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired
of your character   i could not bring it into play  it was overwhelmed 
buried  lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under
year after year   i could think of you only as one who had yielded 
who had given me up  who had been influenced by any one rather than by me 
i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery 
i had no reason to believe her of less authority now   the force of habit
was to be added  

 i should have thought   said anne   that my manner to yourself
might have spared you much or all of this  

 no  no  your manner might be only the ease which your engagement
to another man would give   i left you in this belief  and yet 
i was determined to see you again   my spirits rallied with the morning 
and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here  

at last anne was at home again  and happier than any one in that house
could have conceived   all the surprise and suspense  and every other
painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation 
she re entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy
in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last 
an interval of meditation  serious and grateful  was the best corrective
of everything dangerous in such high wrought felicity  and she went
to her room  and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness
of her enjoyment 

the evening came  the drawing rooms were lighted up  the company assembled 
it was but a card party  it was but a mixture of those who had
never met before  and those who met too often  a commonplace business 
too numerous for intimacy  too small for variety  but anne had never found
an evening shorter   glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness 
and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for 
she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her 
mr elliot was there  she avoided  but she could pity him 
the wallises  she had amusement in understanding them   lady dalrymple
and miss carteret  they would soon be innoxious cousins to her 
she cared not for mrs clay  and had nothing to blush for in
the public manners of her father and sister   with the musgroves 
there was the happy chat of perfect ease  with captain harville 
the kind hearted intercourse of brother and sister  with lady russell 
attempts at conversation  which a delicious consciousness cut short 
with admiral and mrs croft  everything of peculiar cordiality and
fervent interest  which the same consciousness sought to conceal 
and with captain wentworth  some moments of communications
continually occurring  and always the hope of more  and always
the knowledge of his being there 

it was in one of these short meetings  each apparently occupied
in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants  that she said  

 i have been thinking over the past  and trying impartially
to judge of the right and wrong  i mean with regard to myself 
and i must believe that i was right  much as i suffered from it 
that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom
you will love better than you do now   to me  she was in the place
of a parent   do not mistake me  however   i am not saying
that she did not err in her advice   it was  perhaps  one of those cases
in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides 
and for myself  i certainly never should  in any circumstance
of tolerable similarity  give such advice   but i mean  that i was right
in submitting to her  and that if i had done otherwise  i should have
suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up 
because i should have suffered in my conscience   i have now 
as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature  nothing
to reproach myself with  and if i mistake not  a strong sense of duty
is no bad part of a woman s portion  

he looked at her  looked at lady russell  and looking again at her 
replied  as if in cool deliberation  

 not yet   but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time 
i trust to being in charity with her soon   but i too have been
thinking over the past  and a  question has suggested itself 
whether there may not have been one person more my enemy
even than that lady   my own self   tell me if  when i returned
to england in the year eight  with a few thousand pounds 
and was posted into the laconia  if i had then written to you 
would you have answered my letter   would you  in short 
have renewed the engagement then  

 would i   was all her answer  but the accent was decisive enough 

 good god   he cried   you would   it is not that i did not think of it 
or desire it  as what could alone crown all my other success 
but i was proud  too proud to ask again   i did not understand you 
i shut my eyes  and would not understand you  or do you justice 
this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one
sooner than myself   six years of separation and suffering
might have been spared   it is a sort of pain  too  which is new to me 
i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn
every blessing that i enjoyed   i have valued myself on honourable toils
and just rewards   like other great men under reverses   he added 
with a smile   i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune 
i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve  



chapter 24


who can be in doubt of what followed   when any two young people
take it into their heads to marry  they are pretty sure by perseverance
to carry their point  be they ever so poor  or ever so imprudent 
or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other s ultimate comfort 
this may be bad morality to conclude with  but i believe it to be truth 
and if such parties succeed  how should a captain wentworth and
an anne elliot  with the advantage of maturity of mind 
consciousness of right  and one independent fortune between them 
fail of bearing down every opposition   they might in fact 
have borne down a great deal more than they met with  for there was
little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth 
sir walter made no objection  and elizabeth did nothing worse
than look cold and unconcerned   captain wentworth  with five and twenty
thousand pounds  and as high in his profession as merit and activity
could place him  was no longer nobody   he was now esteemed quite worthy
to address the daughter of a foolish  spendthrift baronet 
who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself
in the situation in which providence had placed him  and who could
give his daughter at present but a small part of the share
of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter 

sir walter  indeed  though he had no affection for anne 
and no vanity flattered  to make him really happy on the occasion 
was very far from thinking it a bad match for her   on the contrary 
when he saw more of captain wentworth  saw him repeatedly by daylight 
and eyed him well  he was very much struck by his personal claims 
and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced
against her superiority of rank  and all this  assisted by
his well sounding name  enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen 
with a very good grace  for the insertion of the marriage
in the volume of honour 

the only one among them  whose opposition of feeling could excite
any serious anxiety was lady russell   anne knew that lady russell
must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot 
and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with 
and do justice to captain wentworth   this however was what
lady russell had now to do   she must learn to feel that she had
been mistaken with regard to both  that she had been unfairly influenced
by appearances in each  that because captain wentworth s manners
had not suited her own ideas  she had been too quick in suspecting them
to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity  and that because
mr elliot s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety
and correctness  their general politeness and suavity  she had been
too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct
opinions and well regulated mind   there was nothing less
for lady russell to do  than to admit that she had been
pretty completely wrong  and to take up a new set of opinions
and of hopes 

there is a quickness of perception in some  a nicety in the discernment
of character  a natural penetration  in short  which no experience
in others can equal  and lady russell had been less gifted
in this part of understanding than her young friend   but she was
a very good woman  and if her second object was to be sensible
and well judging  her first was to see anne happy   she loved anne
better than she loved her own abilities  and when the awkwardness
of the beginning was over  found little hardship in attaching herself
as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child 

of all the family  mary was probably the one most immediately gratified
by the circumstance   it was creditable to have a sister married 
and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental
to the connexion  by keeping anne with her in the autumn 
and as her own sister must be better than her husband s sisters 
it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than
either captain benwick or charles hayter   she had something to suffer 
perhaps  when they came into contact again  in seeing anne restored
to the rights of seniority  and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette 
but she had a future to look forward to  of powerful consolation 
anne had no uppercross hall before her  no landed estate 
no headship of a family  and if they could but keep captain wentworth
from being made a baronet  she would not change situations with anne 

it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied
with her situation  for a change is not very probable there 
she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw 
and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise
even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him 

the news of his cousins anne s engagement burst on mr elliot
most unexpectedly   it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness 
his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness
which a son in law s rights would have given   but  though discomfited
and disappointed  he could still do something for his own interest
and his own enjoyment   he soon quitted bath  and on mrs clay s
quitting it soon afterwards  and being next heard of as established
under his protection in london  it was evident how double a game
he had been playing  and how determined he was to save himself
from being cut out by one artful woman  at least 

mrs clay s affections had overpowered her interest  and she had sacrificed 
for the young man s sake  the possibility of scheming longer
for sir walter   she has abilities  however  as well as affections 
and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning  or hers 
may finally carry the day  whether  after preventing her from being
the wife of sir walter  he may not be wheedled and caressed at last
into making her the wife of sir william 

it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked
and mortified by the loss of their companion  and the discovery of
their deception in her   they had their great cousins  to be sure 
to resort to for comfort  but they must long feel that to flatter
and follow others  without being flattered and followed in turn 
is but a state of half enjoyment 

anne  satisfied at a very early period of lady russell s meaning
to love captain wentworth as she ought  had no other alloy
to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness
of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value 
there she felt her own inferiority very keenly   the disproportion
in their fortune was nothing  it did not give her a moment s regret 
but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly 
nothing of respectability  of harmony  of good will to offer
in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her
in his brothers and sisters  was a source of as lively pain
as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise
strong felicity   she had but two friends in the world to add to his list 
lady russell and mrs smith   to those  however  he was very well disposed
to attach himself   lady russell  in spite of all her former transgressions 
he could now value from his heart   while he was not obliged to say
that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them 
he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour 
and as for mrs smith  she had claims of various kinds to recommend her
quickly and permanently 

her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves 
and their marriage  instead of depriving her of one friend 
secured her two   she was their earliest visitor in their settled life 
and captain wentworth  by putting her in the way of recovering
her husband s property in the west indies  by writing for her 
acting for her  and seeing her through all the petty difficulties
of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man
and a determined friend  fully requited the services which
she had rendered  or ever meant to render  to his wife 

mrs smith s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income 
with some improvement of health  and the acquisition of such friends
to be often with  for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not
fail her  and while these prime supplies of good remained  she might have
bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity 
she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy 
and yet be happy   her spring of felicity was in the glow
of her spirits  as her friend anne s was in the warmth of her heart 
anne was tenderness itself  and she had the full worth of it
in captain wentworth s affection   his profession was all that could ever
make her friends wish that tenderness less  the dread of a future war
all that could dim her sunshine   she gloried in being a sailor s wife 
but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession
which is  if possible  more distinguished in its domestic virtues
than in its national importance

 sense and sensibility by jane austen 1811 

chapter 1


the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex 
their estate was large  and their residence was at norland park 
in the centre of their property  where  for many generations 
they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage
the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance 
the late owner of this estate was a single man  who lived
to a very advanced age  and who for many years of his life 
had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister 
but her death  which happened ten years before his own 
produced a great alteration in his home  for to supply
her loss  he invited and received into his house the family
of his nephew mr  henry dashwood  the legal inheritor
of the norland estate  and the person to whom he intended
to bequeath it   in the society of his nephew and niece 
and their children  the old gentleman s days were
comfortably spent   his attachment to them all increased 
the constant attention of mr  and mrs  henry dashwood
to his wishes  which proceeded not merely from interest 
but from goodness of heart  gave him every degree of solid
comfort which his age could receive  and the cheerfulness
of the children added a relish to his existence 

by a former marriage  mr  henry dashwood had one
son  by his present lady  three daughters   the son 
a steady respectable young man  was amply provided
for by the fortune of his mother  which had been large 
and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age 
by his own marriage  likewise  which happened soon afterwards 
he added to his wealth   to him therefore the succession
to the norland estate was not so really important as to
his sisters  for their fortune  independent of what might
arise to them from their father s inheriting that property 
could be but small   their mother had nothing  and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal 
for the remaining moiety of his first wife s fortune was
also secured to her child  and he had only a life interest
in it 

the old gentleman died  his will was read  and
like almost every other will  gave as much disappointment
as pleasure   he was neither so unjust  nor so ungrateful 
as to leave his estate from his nephew   but he left it to him
on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest 
mr  dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his
wife and daughters than for himself or his son   but to
his son  and his son s son  a child of four years old 
it was secured  in such a way  as to leave to himself
no power of providing for those who were most dear
to him  and who most needed a provision by any charge
on the estate  or by any sale of its valuable woods 
the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child  who 
in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland 
had so far gained on the affections of his uncle 
by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children
of two or three years old  an imperfect articulation 
an earnest desire of having his own way  many cunning tricks 
and a great deal of noise  as to outweigh all the value
of all the attention which  for years  he had received
from his niece and her daughters   he meant not to
be unkind  however  and  as a mark of his affection
for the three girls  he left them a thousand pounds a piece 

mr  dashwood s disappointment was  at first  severe 
but his temper was cheerful and sanguine  and he might
reasonably hope to live many years  and by living economically 
lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate
already large  and capable of almost immediate improvement 
but the fortune  which had been so tardy in coming  was his
only one twelvemonth   he survived his uncle no longer 
and ten thousand pounds  including the late legacies 
was all that remained for his widow and daughters 

his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known 
and to him mr  dashwood recommended  with all the strength
and urgency which illness could command  the interest
of his mother in law and sisters 

mr  john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the
rest of the family  but he was affected by a recommendation
of such a nature at such a time  and he promised to do
every thing in his power to make them comfortable 
his father was rendered easy by such an assurance 
and mr  john dashwood had then leisure to consider how
much there might prudently be in his power to do for them 

he was not an ill disposed young man  unless to
be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be
ill disposed  but he was  in general  well respected 
for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge
of his ordinary duties   had he married a more amiable woman 
he might have been made still more respectable than he
was   he might even have been made amiable himself  for he
was very young when he married  and very fond of his wife 
but mrs  john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself   
more narrow minded and selfish 

when he gave his promise to his father  he meditated
within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters
by the present of a thousand pounds a piece   he then
really thought himself equal to it   the prospect of four
thousand a year  in addition to his present income 
besides the remaining half of his own mother s fortune 
warmed his heart  and made him feel capable of generosity   
 yes  he would give them three thousand pounds  it would
be liberal and handsome  it would be enough to make
them completely easy   three thousand pounds  he could
spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience    
he thought of it all day long  and for many days successively 
and he did not repent 

no sooner was his father s funeral over  than mrs  john
dashwood  without sending any notice of her intention to her
mother in law  arrived with her child and their attendants 
no one could dispute her right to come  the house was
her husband s from the moment of his father s decease 
but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater 
and to a woman in mrs  dashwood s situation  with only
common feelings  must have been highly unpleasing   
but in her mind there was a sense of honor so keen 
a generosity so romantic  that any offence of the kind 
by whomsoever given or received  was to her a source
of immoveable disgust   mrs  john dashwood had never
been a favourite with any of her husband s family 
but she had had no opportunity  till the present 
of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort
of other people she could act when occasion required it 

so acutely did mrs  dashwood feel this ungracious
behaviour  and so earnestly did she despise her
daughter in law for it  that  on the arrival of the latter 
she would have quitted the house for ever  had not the
entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect
on the propriety of going  and her own tender love for all
her three children determined her afterwards to stay 
and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother 

elinor  this eldest daughter  whose advice was
so effectual  possessed a strength of understanding 
and coolness of judgment  which qualified her 
though only nineteen  to be the counsellor of her mother 
and enabled her frequently to counteract  to the advantage
of them all  that eagerness of mind in mrs  dashwood
which must generally have led to imprudence   she had
an excellent heart   her disposition was affectionate 
and her feelings were strong  but she knew how to govern
them  it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn 
and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught 

marianne s abilities were  in many respects 
quite equal to elinor s  she was sensible and clever 
but eager in everything  her sorrows  her joys  could have
no moderation   she was generous  amiable  interesting  she
was everything but prudent   the resemblance between
her and her mother was strikingly great 

elinor saw  with concern  the excess of her
sister s sensibility  but by mrs  dashwood it was valued
and cherished   they encouraged each other now in the
violence of their affliction   the agony of grief
which overpowered them at first  was voluntarily renewed 
was sought for  was created again and again   they gave
themselves up wholly to their sorrow  seeking increase
of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it 
and resolved against ever admitting consolation
in future   elinor  too  was deeply afflicted  but still
she could struggle  she could exert herself   she could
consult with her brother  could receive her sister in law
on her arrival  and treat her with proper attention 
and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion 
and encourage her to similar forbearance 

margaret  the other sister  was a good humored 
well disposed girl  but as she had already imbibed
a good deal of marianne s romance  without having
much of her sense  she did not  at thirteen  bid fair
to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life 



chapter 2


mrs  john dashwood now installed herself mistress
of norland  and her mother and sisters in law were degraded
to the condition of visitors   as such  however  they were
treated by her with quiet civility  and by her husband
with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody
beyond himself  his wife  and their child   he really
pressed them  with some earnestness  to consider norland
as their home  and  as no plan appeared so eligible
to mrs  dashwood as remaining there till she could
accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood 
his invitation was accepted 

a continuance in a place where everything reminded
her of former delight  was exactly what suited her mind 
in seasons of cheerfulness  no temper could be more cheerful
than hers  or possess  in a greater degree  that sanguine
expectation of happiness which is happiness itself 
but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy 
and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was
beyond alloy 

mrs  john dashwood did not at all approve of what her
husband intended to do for his sisters   to take three
thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy
would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree 
she begged him to think again on the subject   how could
he answer it to himself to rob his child  and his only
child too  of so large a sum   and what possible claim
could the miss dashwoods  who were related to him only by
half blood  which she considered as no relationship at all 
have on his generosity to so large an amount   it was very
well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist
between the children of any man by different marriages 
and why was he to ruin himself  and their poor little harry 
by giving away all his money to his half sisters 

 it was my father s last request to me   replied
her husband   that i should assist his widow and daughters  

 he did not know what he was talking of  i dare say 
ten to one but he was light headed at the time 
had he been in his right senses  he could not have thought
of such a thing as begging you to give away half your
fortune from your own child  

 he did not stipulate for any particular sum 
my dear fanny  he only requested me  in general terms 
to assist them  and make their situation more comfortable
than it was in his power to do   perhaps it would
have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself 
he could hardly suppose i should neglect them 
but as he required the promise  i could not do less
than give it  at least i thought so at the time 
the promise  therefore  was given  and must be performed 
something must be done for them whenever they leave norland
and settle in a new home  

 well  then  let something be done for them 
but that something need not be three thousand pounds 
consider   she added   that when the money is once
parted with  it never can return   your sisters will marry 
and it will be gone for ever   if  indeed  it could
be restored to our poor little boy   

 why  to be sure   said her husband  very gravely 
 that would make great difference   the time may come when
harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with 
if he should have a numerous family  for instance  it would
be a very convenient addition  

 to be sure it would  

 perhaps  then  it would be better for all parties 
if the sum were diminished one half   five hundred pounds
would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes  

 oh  beyond anything great   what brother on earth
would do half so much for his sisters  even if really
his sisters   and as it is  only half blood   but you
have such a generous spirit  

 i would not wish to do any thing mean   he replied 
 one had rather  on such occasions  do too much than
too little   no one  at least  can think i have not
done enough for them  even themselves  they can hardly
expect more  

 there is no knowing what they may expect  
said the lady   but we are not to think of their
expectations  the question is  what you can afford to do  

 certainly  and i think i may afford to give them five
hundred pounds a piece   as it is  without any addition
of mine  they will each have about three thousand pounds
on their mother s death  a very comfortable fortune
for any young woman  

 to be sure it is  and  indeed  it strikes me that
they can want no addition at all   they will have ten
thousand pounds divided amongst them   if they marry 
they will be sure of doing well  and if they do not 
they may all live very comfortably together on the interest
of ten thousand pounds  

 that is very true  and  therefore  i do not know whether 
upon the whole  it would not be more advisable to do
something for their mother while she lives  rather than
for them  something of the annuity kind i mean   my sisters
would feel the good effects of it as well as herself 
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable  

his wife hesitated a little  however  in giving
her consent to this plan 

 to be sure   said she   it is better than parting with
fifteen hundred pounds at once   but  then  if mrs  dashwood
should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in  

 fifteen years  my dear fanny  her life cannot
be worth half that purchase  

 certainly not  but if you observe  people always
live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them 
and she is very stout and healthy  and hardly forty 
an annuity is a very serious business  it comes over
and over every year  and there is no getting rid
of it   you are not aware of what you are doing 
i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities 
for my mother was clogged with the payment of three
to old superannuated servants by my father s will 
and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it 
twice every year these annuities were to be paid  and then
there was the trouble of getting it to them  and then one
of them was said to have died  and afterwards it turned
out to be no such thing   my mother was quite sick of it 
her income was not her own  she said  with such perpetual
claims on it  and it was the more unkind in my father 
because  otherwise  the money would have been entirely at
my mother s disposal  without any restriction whatever 
it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities  that i am
sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for
all the world  

 it is certainly an unpleasant thing   replied mr  dashwood 
 to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income 
one s fortune  as your mother justly says  is not one s own 
to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum 
on every rent day  is by no means desirable  it takes away
one s independence  

 undoubtedly  and after all you have no thanks for it 
they think themselves secure  you do no more than what
is expected  and it raises no gratitude at all   if i were you 
whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely 
i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly 
it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred 
or even fifty pounds from our own expenses  

 i believe you are right  my love  it will be better
that there should by no annuity in the case  whatever i
may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance
than a yearly allowance  because they would only enlarge
their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income 
and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end
of the year   it will certainly be much the best way 
a present of fifty pounds  now and then  will prevent
their ever being distressed for money  and will  i think 
be amply discharging my promise to my father  

 to be sure it will   indeed  to say the truth 
i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea
of your giving them any money at all   the assistance
he thought of  i dare say  was only such as might be
reasonably expected of you  for instance  such as looking
out for a comfortable small house for them  helping them
to move their things  and sending them presents of fish
and game  and so forth  whenever they are in season 
i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther  indeed 
it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did 
do but consider  my dear mr  dashwood  how excessively
comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live
on the interest of seven thousand pounds  besides the
thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls  which brings
them in fifty pounds a year a piece  and  of course 
they will pay their mother for their board out of it 
altogether  they will have five hundred a year amongst them 
and what on earth can four women want for more than
that   they will live so cheap  their housekeeping will
be nothing at all   they will have no carriage  no horses 
and hardly any servants  they will keep no company 
and can have no expenses of any kind   only conceive
how comfortable they will be   five hundred a year  i am
sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it 
and as to your giving them more  it is quite absurd to think
of it   they will be much more able to give you something  

 upon my word   said mr  dashwood   i believe you
are perfectly right   my father certainly could mean
nothing more by his request to me than what you say 
i clearly understand it now  and i will strictly fulfil
my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness
to them as you have described   when my mother removes
into another house my services shall be readily given
to accommodate her as far as i can   some little present
of furniture too may be acceptable then  

 certainly   returned mrs  john dashwood    but  however 
one thing must be considered   when your father and mother
moved to norland  though the furniture of stanhill
was sold  all the china  plate  and linen was saved 
and is now left to your mother   her house will therefore
be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it  

 that is a material consideration undoubtedly 
a valuable legacy indeed  and yet some of the plate would
have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here  

 yes  and the set of breakfast china is twice
as handsome as what belongs to this house   a great
deal too handsome  in my opinion  for any place they
can ever afford to live in   but  however  so it is 
your father thought only of them   and i must say this 
that you owe no particular gratitude to him  nor attention
to his wishes  for we very well know that if he could 
he would have left almost everything in the world to them  

this argument was irresistible   it gave to his
intentions whatever of decision was wanting before  and he
finally resolved  that it would be absolutely unnecessary 
if not highly indecorous  to do more for the widow
and children of his father  than such kind of neighbourly
acts as his own wife pointed out 



chapter 3


mrs  dashwood remained at norland several months 
not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every
well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it
produced for a while  for when her spirits began to revive 
and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that
of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances 
she was impatient to be gone  and indefatigable in her inquiries
for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland 
for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible 
but she could hear of no situation that at once answered
her notions of comfort and ease  and suited the prudence
of her eldest daughter  whose steadier judgment rejected
several houses as too large for their income  which her
mother would have approved 

mrs  dashwood had been informed by her husband of the
solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour 
which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections 
she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he
had doubted it himself  and she thought of it for her daughters 
sake with satisfaction  though as for herself she was
persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would
support her in affluence   for their brother s sake  too 
for the sake of his own heart  she rejoiced  and she
reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before 
in believing him incapable of generosity   his attentive
behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that
their welfare was dear to him  and  for a long time 
she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions 

the contempt which she had  very early in their acquaintance 
felt for her daughter in law  was very much increased
by the farther knowledge of her character  which half
a year s residence in her family afforded  and perhaps
in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal
affection on the side of the former  the two ladies might
have found it impossible to have lived together so long 
had not a particular circumstance occurred to give
still greater eligibility  according to the opinions
of mrs  dashwood  to her daughters  continuance at norland 

this circumstance was a growing attachment between
her eldest girl and the brother of mrs  john dashwood 
a gentleman like and pleasing young man  who was introduced
to their acquaintance soon after his sister s establishment
at norland  and who had since spent the greatest part
of his time there 

some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from
motives of interest  for edward ferrars was the eldest son
of a man who had died very rich  and some might have repressed
it from motives of prudence  for  except a trifling sum 
the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother 
but mrs  dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration 
it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable 
that he loved her daughter  and that elinor returned
the partiality   it was contrary to every doctrine of
her s that difference of fortune should keep any couple
asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition 
and that elinor s merit should not be acknowledged
by every one who knew her  was to her comprehension impossible 

edward ferrars was not recommended to their good
opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address 
he was not handsome  and his manners required intimacy
to make them pleasing   he was too diffident to do justice
to himself  but when his natural shyness was overcome 
his behaviour gave every indication of an open 
affectionate heart   his understanding was good 
and his education had given it solid improvement 
but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition
to answer the wishes of his mother and sister  who longed
to see him distinguished  as  they hardly knew what 
they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some
manner or other   his mother wished to interest him in
political concerns  to get him into parliament  or to see
him connected with some of the great men of the day 
mrs  john dashwood wished it likewise  but in the mean while 
till one of these superior blessings could be attained  it would
have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche 
but edward had no turn for great men or barouches 
all his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet
of private life   fortunately he had a younger brother
who was more promising 

edward had been staying several weeks in the house
before he engaged much of mrs  dashwood s attention 
for she was  at that time  in such affliction as rendered
her careless of surrounding objects   she saw only that he
was quiet and unobtrusive  and she liked him for it 
he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by
ill timed conversation   she was first called to observe
and approve him farther  by a reflection which elinor
chanced one day to make on the difference between him
and his sister   it was a contrast which recommended him
most forcibly to her mother 

 it is enough   said she   to say that he is unlike
fanny is enough   it implies everything amiable 
i love him already  

 i think you will like him   said elinor   when you
know more of him  

 like him   replied her mother with a smile 
 i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love  

 you may esteem him  

 i have never yet known what it was to separate
esteem and love  

mrs  dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him 
her manners were attaching  and soon banished his reserve 
she speedily comprehended all his merits  the persuasion
of his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration 
but she really felt assured of his worth  and even that
quietness of manner  which militated against all her
established ideas of what a young man s address ought to be 
was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be
warm and his temper affectionate 

no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love
in his behaviour to elinor  than she considered their
serious attachment as certain  and looked forward
to their marriage as rapidly approaching 

 in a few months  my dear marianne   said she 
 elinor will  in all probability be settled for life 
we shall miss her  but she will be happy  

 oh  mamma  how shall we do without her  

 my love  it will be scarcely a separation 
we shall live within a few miles of each other  and shall
meet every day of our lives   you will gain a brother 
a real  affectionate brother   i have the highest opinion
in the world of edward s heart   but you look grave 
marianne  do you disapprove your sister s choice  

 perhaps   said marianne   i may consider it
with some surprise   edward is very amiable  and i love
him tenderly   but yet  he is not the kind of young
man  there is something wanting  his figure is not striking 
it has none of that grace which i should expect
in the man who could seriously attach my sister 
his eyes want all that spirit  that fire  which at once
announce virtue and intelligence   and besides all this 
i am afraid  mamma  he has no real taste   music seems
scarcely to attract him  and though he admires elinor s
drawings very much  it is not the admiration of a person
who can understand their worth   it is evident  in spite of
his frequent attention to her while she draws  that in fact
he knows nothing of the matter   he admires as a lover 
not as a connoisseur   to satisfy me  those characters
must be united   i could not be happy with a man whose
taste did not in every point coincide with my own 
he must enter into all my feelings  the same books 
the same music must charm us both   oh  mama  how spiritless 
how tame was edward s manner in reading to us last night 
i felt for my sister most severely   yet she bore it
with so much composure  she seemed scarcely to notice it 
i could hardly keep my seat   to hear those beautiful lines
which have frequently almost driven me wild  pronounced
with such impenetrable calmness  such dreadful indifference    

 he would certainly have done more justice to
simple and elegant prose   i thought so at the time 
but you would give him cowper  

 nay  mamma  if he is not to be animated by cowper   
but we must allow for difference of taste   elinor has
not my feelings  and therefore she may overlook it  and
be happy with him   but it would have broke my heart 
had i loved him  to hear him read with so little sensibility 
mama  the more i know of the world  the more am i convinced
that i shall never see a man whom i can really love 
i require so much   he must have all edward s virtues 
and his person and manners must ornament his goodness
with every possible charm  

 remember  my love  that you are not seventeen 
it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness 
why should you be less fortunate than your mother   in
one circumstance only  my marianne  may your destiny be
different from her s  



chapter 4


 what a pity it is  elinor   said marianne 
 that edward should have no taste for drawing  

 no taste for drawing   replied elinor   why should
you think so  he does not draw himself  indeed  but he has
great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people 
and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste 
though he has not had opportunities of improving it 
had he ever been in the way of learning  i think he would
have drawn very well   he distrusts his own judgment
in such matters so much  that he is always unwilling
to give his opinion on any picture  but he has an innate
propriety and simplicity of taste  which in general
direct him perfectly right  

marianne was afraid of offending  and said no more
on the subject  but the kind of approbation which elinor
described as excited in him by the drawings of other
people  was very far from that rapturous delight  which 
in her opinion  could alone be called taste   yet  though
smiling within herself at the mistake  she honoured
her sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it 

 i hope  marianne   continued elinor   you do not
consider him as deficient in general taste   indeed  i think
i may say that you cannot  for your behaviour to him
is perfectly cordial  and if that were your opinion 
i am sure you could never be civil to him  

marianne hardly knew what to say   she would
not wound the feelings of her sister on any account 
and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible 
at length she replied 

 do not be offended  elinor  if my praise of him
is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits 
i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter
propensities of his mind  his inclinations and tastes 
as you have  but i have the highest opinion in the world
of his goodness and sense   i think him every thing that is
worthy and amiable  

 i am sure   replied elinor  with a smile 
 that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied
with such commendation as that   i do not perceive
how you could express yourself more warmly  

marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased 

 of his sense and his goodness   continued elinor 
 no one can  i think  be in doubt  who has seen him
often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation 
the excellence of his understanding and his principles
can be concealed only by that shyness which too often
keeps him silent   you know enough of him to do justice
to his solid worth   but of his minuter propensities 
as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances
been kept more ignorant than myself   he and i have
been at times thrown a good deal together  while you
have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate
principle by my mother   i have seen a great deal of him 
have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on
subjects of literature and taste  and  upon the whole 
i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed 
enjoyment of books exceedingly great  his imagination lively 
his observation just and correct  and his taste delicate
and pure   his abilities in every respect improve
as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person 
at first sight  his address is certainly not striking 
and his person can hardly be called handsome  till the
expression of his eyes  which are uncommonly good 
and the general sweetness of his countenance  is perceived 
at present  i know him so well  that i think him
really handsome  or at least  almost so   what say you 
marianne  

 i shall very soon think him handsome  elinor  if i
do not now   when you tell me to love him as a brother 
i shall no more see imperfection in his face  than i now do
in his heart  

elinor started at this declaration  and was sorry for
the warmth she had been betrayed into  in speaking of him 
she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion 
she believed the regard to be mutual  but she required
greater certainty of it to make marianne s conviction
of their attachment agreeable to her   she knew that
what marianne and her mother conjectured one moment 
they believed the next  that with them  to wish was to hope 
and to hope was to expect   she tried to explain the real
state of the case to her sister 

 i do not attempt to deny   said she   that i think
very highly of him  that i greatly esteem  that i like him  

marianne here burst forth with indignation  

 esteem him  like him  cold hearted elinor  oh 
worse than cold hearted  ashamed of being otherwise 
use those words again  and i will leave the room this moment  

elinor could not help laughing    excuse me  
said she   and be assured that i meant no offence to you 
by speaking  in so quiet a way  of my own feelings 
believe them to be stronger than i have declared 
believe them  in short  to be such as his merit  and the
suspicion  the hope of his affection for me may warrant 
without imprudence or folly   but farther than this you must
not believe   i am by no means assured of his regard for me 
there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful 
and till his sentiments are fully known  you cannot wonder
at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality 
by believing or calling it more than it is   in my heart
i feel little  scarcely any doubt of his preference 
but there are other points to be considered besides
his inclination   he is very far from being independent 
what his mother really is we cannot know  but  from fanny s
occasional mention of her conduct and opinions  we have
never been disposed to think her amiable  and i am very
much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there
would be many difficulties in his way  if he were to wish
to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or
high rank  

marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination
of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth 

 and you really are not engaged to him   said she 
 yet it certainly soon will happen   but two advantages
will proceed from this delay   i shall not lose you so soon 
and edward will have greater opportunity of improving
that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must
be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity 
oh  if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to
learn to draw himself  how delightful it would be  

elinor had given her real opinion to her sister 
she could not consider her partiality for edward
in so prosperous a state as marianne had believed it 
there was  at times  a want of spirits about him which 
if it did not denote indifference  spoke of something almost
as unpromising   a doubt of her regard  supposing him
to feel it  need not give him more than inquietude 
it would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind
which frequently attended him   a more reasonable cause
might be found in the dependent situation which forbade
the indulgence of his affection   she knew that his mother
neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable
at present  nor to give him any assurance that he might form
a home for himself  without strictly attending to her views
for his aggrandizement   with such a knowledge as this 
it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject 
she was far from depending on that result of his preference
of her  which her mother and sister still considered
as certain   nay  the longer they were together the more
doubtful seemed the nature of his regard  and sometimes 
for a few painful minutes  she believed it to be no more
than friendship 

but  whatever might really be its limits  it was enough 
when perceived by his sister  to make her uneasy 
and at the same time   which was still more common  
to make her uncivil   she took the first opportunity of
affronting her mother in law on the occasion  talking to
her so expressively of her brother s great expectations 
of mrs  ferrars s resolution that both her sons should
marry well  and of the danger attending any young woman
who attempted to draw him in  that mrs  dashwood could
neither pretend to be unconscious  nor endeavor to be calm 
she gave her an answer which marked her contempt 
and instantly left the room  resolving that  whatever might
be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal 
her beloved elinor should not be exposed another week
to such insinuations 

in this state of her spirits  a letter was delivered
to her from the post  which contained a proposal
particularly well timed   it was the offer of a small house 
on very easy terms  belonging to a relation of her own 
a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire 
the letter was from this gentleman himself  and written
in the true spirit of friendly accommodation 
he understood that she was in need of a dwelling 
and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage 
he assured her that everything should be done to it which
she might think necessary  if the situation pleased her 
he earnestly pressed her  after giving the particulars
of the house and garden  to come with her daughters to
barton park  the place of his own residence  from whence
she might judge  herself  whether barton cottage  for the
houses were in the same parish  could  by any alteration 
be made comfortable to her   he seemed really anxious to
accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written
in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure
to his cousin  more especially at a moment when she was
suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her
nearer connections   she needed no time for deliberation
or inquiry   her resolution was formed as she read 
the situation of barton  in a county so far distant from
sussex as devonshire  which  but a few hours before 
would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every
possible advantage belonging to the place  was now its
first recommendation   to quit the neighbourhood of norland
was no longer an evil  it was an object of desire 
it was a blessing  in comparison of the misery of continuing
her daughter in law s guest  and to remove for ever
from that beloved place would be less painful than to
inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress 
she instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment
of his kindness  and her acceptance of his proposal 
and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters 
that she might be secure of their approbation before her
answer were sent 

elinor had always thought it would be more prudent
for them to settle at some distance from norland 
than immediately amongst their present acquaintance 
on that head  therefore  it was not for her to oppose
her mother s intention of removing into devonshire 
the house  too  as described by sir john  was on so
simple a scale  and the rent so uncommonly moderate 
as to leave her no right of objection on either point 
and  therefore  though it was not a plan which brought
any charm to her fancy  though it was a removal from
the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes  she made
no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter
of acquiescence 



chapter 5


no sooner was her answer dispatched  than mrs  dashwood
indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her
son in law and his wife that she was provided with a house 
and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were
ready for her inhabiting it   they heard her with surprise 
mrs  john dashwood said nothing  but her husband civilly
hoped that she would not be settled far from norland 
she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going
into devonshire   edward turned hastily towards her 
on hearing this  and  in a voice of surprise and concern 
which required no explanation to her  repeated 
 devonshire  are you  indeed  going there   so far from hence 
and to what part of it    she explained the situation 
it was within four miles northward of exeter 

 it is but a cottage   she continued   but i hope
to see many of my friends in it   a room or two can
easily be added  and if my friends find no difficulty
in travelling so far to see me  i am sure i will find
none in accommodating them  

she concluded with a very kind invitation to
mr  and mrs  john dashwood to visit her at barton 
and to edward she gave one with still greater affection 
though her late conversation with her daughter in law had
made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than
was unavoidable  it had not produced the smallest effect
on her in that point to which it principally tended 
to separate edward and elinor was as far from being her
object as ever  and she wished to show mrs  john dashwood 
by this pointed invitation to her brother  how totally she
disregarded her disapprobation of the match 

mr  john dashwood told his mother again and again
how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at
such a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any
service to her in removing her furniture   he really felt
conscientiously vexed on the occasion  for the very exertion
to which he had limited the performance of his promise to
his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable   
the furniture was all sent around by water   it chiefly
consisted of household linen  plate  china  and books 
with a handsome pianoforte of marianne s   mrs  john
dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh  she could
not help feeling it hard that as mrs  dashwood s income
would be so trifling in comparison with their own 
she should have any handsome article of furniture 

mrs  dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth  it was
ready furnished  and she might have immediate possession 
no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement  and she
waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland 
and to determine her future household  before she set
off for the west  and this  as she was exceedingly rapid
in the performance of everything that interested her 
was soon done   the horses which were left her by her husband
had been sold soon after his death  and an opportunity
now offering of disposing of her carriage  she agreed
to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her
eldest daughter   for the comfort of her children  had she
consulted only her own wishes  she would have kept it 
but the discretion of elinor prevailed   her wisdom
too limited the number of their servants to three 
two maids and a man  with whom they were speedily provided
from amongst those who had formed their establishment
at norland 

the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately
into devonshire  to prepare the house for their mistress s
arrival  for as lady middleton was entirely unknown
to mrs  dashwood  she preferred going directly to the
cottage to being a visitor at barton park  and she relied
so undoubtingly on sir john s description of the house 
as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she
entered it as her own   her eagerness to be gone from norland
was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction
of her daughter in law in the prospect of her removal 
a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed
under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure 
now was the time when her son in law s promise to his
father might with particular propriety be fulfilled 
since he had neglected to do it on first coming to
the estate  their quitting his house might be looked
on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment 
but mrs  dashwood began shortly to give over every
hope of the kind  and to be convinced  from the general
drift of his discourse  that his assistance extended no
farther than their maintenance for six months at norland 
he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses
of housekeeping  and of the perpetual demands upon his purse 
which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond
calculation exposed to  that he seemed rather to stand
in need of more money himself than to have any design of
giving money away 

in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir
john middleton s first letter to norland  every thing was
so far settled in their future abode as to enable
mrs  dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey 

many were the tears shed by them in their last
adieus to a place so much beloved    dear  dear norland  
said marianne  as she wandered alone before the house 
on the last evening of their being there   when shall i cease
to regret you   when learn to feel a home elsewhere   oh 
happy house  could you know what i suffer in now viewing
you from this spot  from whence perhaps i may view
you no more   and you  ye well known trees   but you
will continue the same   no leaf will decay because we
are removed  nor any branch become motionless although we
can observe you no longer   no  you will continue the same 
unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion 
and insensible of any change in those who walk under your
shade   but who will remain to enjoy you  



chapter 6


the first part of their journey was performed in too
melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious
and unpleasant   but as they drew towards the end of it 
their interest in the appearance of a country which they
were to inhabit overcame their dejection  and a view of
barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness 
it was a pleasant fertile spot  well wooded  and rich
in pasture   after winding along it for more than a mile 
they reached their own house   a small green court was
the whole of its demesne in front  and a neat wicket gate
admitted them into it 

as a house  barton cottage  though small  was comfortable
and compact  but as a cottage it was defective  for the
building was regular  the roof was tiled  the window
shutters were not painted green  nor were the walls covered
with honeysuckles   a narrow passage led directly through
the house into the garden behind   on each side of the
entrance was a sitting room  about sixteen feet square 
and beyond them were the offices and the stairs 
four bed rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house 
it had not been built many years and was in good repair 
in comparison of norland  it was poor and small indeed   but
the tears which recollection called forth as they entered
the house were soon dried away   they were cheered
by the joy of the servants on their arrival  and each
for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy 
it was very early in september  the season was fine 
and from first seeing the place under the advantage
of good weather  they received an impression in its
favour which was of material service in recommending
it to their lasting approbation 

the situation of the house was good   high hills rose
immediately behind  and at no great distance on each side 
some of which were open downs  the others cultivated and woody 
the village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills 
and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows 
the prospect in front was more extensive  it commanded the
whole of the valley  and reached into the country beyond 
the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated
the valley in that direction  under another name 
and in another course  it branched out again between two
of the steepest of them 

with the size and furniture of the house mrs  dashwood
was upon the whole well satisfied  for though her former
style of life rendered many additions to the latter
indispensable  yet to add and improve was a delight to her 
and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all
that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments 
 as for the house itself  to be sure   said she   it is
too small for our family  but we will make ourselves
tolerably comfortable for the present  as it is too late
in the year for improvements   perhaps in the spring 
if i have plenty of money  as i dare say i shall  we may
think about building   these parlors are both too small
for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often
collected here  and i have some thoughts of throwing the
passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other 
and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance 
this  with a new drawing room which may be easily added 
and a bed chamber and garret above  will make it a very snug
little cottage   i could wish the stairs were handsome 
but one must not expect every thing  though i suppose it
would be no difficult matter to widen them   i shall see
how much i am before hand with the world in the spring 
and we will plan our improvements accordingly  

in the mean time  till all these alterations could
be made from the savings of an income of five hundred
a year by a woman who never saved in her life  they were
wise enough to be contented with the house as it was 
and each of them was busy in arranging their particular
concerns  and endeavoring  by placing around them books
and other possessions  to form themselves a home 
marianne s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of 
and elinor s drawings were affixed to the walls of their
sitting room 

in such employments as these they were interrupted
soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of
their landlord  who called to welcome them to barton 
and to offer them every accommodation from his own house
and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient 
sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty 
he had formerly visited at stanhill  but it was too long
for his young cousins to remember him   his countenance
was thoroughly good humoured  and his manners were
as friendly as the style of his letter   their arrival
seemed to afford him real satisfaction  and their comfort
to be an object of real solicitude to him   he said much
of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable
terms with his family  and pressed them so cordially
to dine at barton park every day till they were better
settled at home  that  though his entreaties were carried
to a point of perseverance beyond civility  they could
not give offence   his kindness was not confined to words 
for within an hour after he left them  a large basket
full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park 
which was followed before the end of the day by a present
of game   he insisted  moreover  on conveying all their
letters to and from the post for them  and would not be
denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper
every day 

lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him 
denoting her intention of waiting on mrs  dashwood as soon as
she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience 
and as this message was answered by an invitation
equally polite  her ladyship was introduced to them the next day 

they were  of course  very anxious to see a person on
whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend  and the
elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes 
lady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty 
her face was handsome  her figure tall and striking 
and her address graceful   her manners had all the elegance
which her husband s wanted   but they would have been
improved by some share of his frankness and warmth 
and her visit was long enough to detract something from
their first admiration  by shewing that  though perfectly
well bred  she was reserved  cold  and had nothing to say
for herself beyond the most common place inquiry or remark 

conversation however was not wanted  for sir john
was very chatty  and lady middleton had taken the wise
precaution of bringing with her their eldest child  a fine
little boy about six years old  by which means there was
one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case
of extremity  for they had to enquire his name and age 
admire his beauty  and ask him questions which his mother
answered for him  while he hung about her and held
down his head  to the great surprise of her ladyship 
who wondered at his being so shy before company  as he
could make noise enough at home   on every formal visit
a child ought to be of the party  by way of provision
for discourse   in the present case it took up ten minutes
to determine whether the boy were most like his father
or mother  and in what particular he resembled either 
for of course every body differed  and every body was
astonished at the opinion of the others 

an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods
of debating on the rest of the children  as sir john
would not leave the house without securing their promise
of dining at the park the next day 



chapter 7


barton park was about half a mile from the cottage 
the ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley 
but it was screened from their view at home by the
projection of a hill   the house was large and handsome 
and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality
and elegance   the former was for sir john s gratification 
the latter for that of his lady   they were scarcely
ever without some friends staying with them in the house 
and they kept more company of every kind than any other
family in the neighbourhood   it was necessary to the
happiness of both  for however dissimilar in temper
and outward behaviour  they strongly resembled each other
in that total want of talent and taste which confined
their employments  unconnected with such as society produced 
within a very narrow compass   sir john was a sportsman 
lady middleton a mother   he hunted and shot  and she
humoured her children  and these were their only resources 
lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her
children all the year round  while sir john s independent
employments were in existence only half the time 
continual engagements at home and abroad  however 
supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education 
supported the good spirits of sir john  and gave exercise
to the good breeding of his wife 

lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance
of her table  and of all her domestic arrangements 
and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment
in any of their parties   but sir john s satisfaction
in society was much more real  he delighted in collecting
about him more young people than his house would hold 
and the noisier they were the better was he pleased 
he was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood 
for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold
ham and chicken out of doors  and in winter his private
balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not
suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen 

the arrival of a new family in the country was always
a matter of joy to him  and in every point of view he was
charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his
cottage at barton   the miss dashwoods were young  pretty 
and unaffected   it was enough to secure his good opinion 
for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could
want to make her mind as captivating as her person 
the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in
accommodating those  whose situation might be considered 
in comparison with the past  as unfortunate   in showing
kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction
of a good heart  and in settling a family of females only
in his cottage  he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman 
for a sportsman  though he esteems only those of his sex who
are sportsmen likewise  is not often desirous of encouraging
their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own
manor 

mrs  dashwood and her daughters were met at the door
of the house by sir john  who welcomed them to barton
park with unaffected sincerity  and as he attended them
to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern
which the same subject had drawn from him the day before 
at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them 
they would see  he said  only one gentleman there
besides himself  a particular friend who was staying at
the park  but who was neither very young nor very gay 
he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party 
and could assure them it should never happen so again 
he had been to several families that morning in hopes
of procuring some addition to their number  but it
was moonlight and every body was full of engagements 
luckily lady middleton s mother had arrived at barton
within the last hour  and as she was a very cheerful
agreeable woman  he hoped the young ladies would not find
it so very dull as they might imagine   the young ladies 
as well as their mother  were perfectly satisfied with
having two entire strangers of the party  and wished for
no more 

mrs  jennings  lady middleton s mother  was a
good humoured  merry  fat  elderly woman  who talked a
great deal  seemed very happy  and rather vulgar   she was full
of jokes and laughter  and before dinner was over had said
many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands 
hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex 
and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not 
marianne was vexed at it for her sister s sake  and turned
her eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks 
with an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than
could arise from such common place raillery as mrs  jennings s 

colonel brandon  the friend of sir john  seemed no
more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend 
than lady middleton was to be his wife  or mrs  jennings
to be lady middleton s mother   he was silent and grave 
his appearance however was not unpleasing  in spite
of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret
an absolute old bachelor  for he was on the wrong side
of five and thirty  but though his face was not handsome 
his countenance was sensible  and his address was
particularly gentlemanlike 

there was nothing in any of the party which could
recommend them as companions to the dashwoods  but the cold
insipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive 
that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon 
and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his
mother in law was interesting   lady middleton seemed
to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her
four noisy children after dinner  who pulled her about 
tore her clothes  and put an end to every kind of discourse
except what related to themselves 

in the evening  as marianne was discovered to be musical 
she was invited to play   the instrument was unlocked 
every body prepared to be charmed  and marianne 
who sang very well  at their request went through the
chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into
the family on her marriage  and which perhaps had lain
ever since in the same position on the pianoforte 
for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving
up music  although by her mother s account  she had
played extremely well  and by her own was very fond of it 

marianne s performance was highly applauded 
sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song 
and as loud in his conversation with the others while every
song lasted   lady middleton frequently called him to order 
wondered how any one s attention could be diverted from music
for a moment  and asked marianne to sing a particular song
which marianne had just finished   colonel brandon alone 
of all the party  heard her without being in raptures 
he paid her only the compliment of attention  and she felt
a respect for him on the occasion  which the others had
reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste 
his pleasure in music  though it amounted not to that
ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own 
was estimable when contrasted against the horrible
insensibility of the others  and she was reasonable enough
to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have
outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite
power of enjoyment   she was perfectly disposed to make
every allowance for the colonel s advanced state of life
which humanity required 



chapter 8


mrs  jennings was a widow with an ample jointure 
she had only two daughters  both of whom she had lived
to see respectably married  and she had now therefore
nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world 
in the promotion of this object she was zealously active 
as far as her ability reached  and missed no opportunity
of projecting weddings among all the young people
of her acquaintance   she was remarkably quick in the
discovery of attachments  and had enjoyed the advantage
of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young
lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man 
and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her
arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel
brandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood 
she rather suspected it to be so  on the very first
evening of their being together  from his listening
so attentively while she sang to them  and when the visit
was returned by the middletons  dining at the cottage 
the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again 
it must be so   she was perfectly convinced of it 
it would be an excellent match  for he was rich  and she
was handsome   mrs  jennings had been anxious to see
colonel brandon well married  ever since her connection
with sir john first brought him to her knowledge 
and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every
pretty girl 

the immediate advantage to herself was by no means
inconsiderable  for it supplied her with endless jokes
against them both   at the park she laughed at the colonel 
and in the cottage at marianne   to the former her
raillery was probably  as far as it regarded only himself 
perfectly indifferent  but to the latter it was at
first incomprehensible  and when its object was understood 
she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity 
or censure its impertinence  for she considered it as an
unfeeling reflection on the colonel s advanced years 
and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor 

mrs  dashwood  who could not think a man five years
younger than herself  so exceedingly ancient as he appeared
to the youthful fancy of her daughter  ventured to clear
mrs  jennings from the probability of wishing to throw
ridicule on his age 

 but at least  mamma  you cannot deny the absurdity
of the accusation  though you may not think it intentionally
ill natured   colonel brandon is certainly younger than
mrs  jennings  but he is old enough to be my father 
and if he were ever animated enough to be in love 
must have long outlived every sensation of the kind 
it is too ridiculous   when is a man to be safe from such wit 
if age and infirmity will not protect him  

 infirmity   said elinor   do you call colonel brandon
infirm   i can easily suppose that his age may appear much
greater to you than to my mother  but you can hardly
deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs  

 did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism 
and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life  

 my dearest child   said her mother  laughing 
 at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay 
and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been
extended to the advanced age of forty  

 mamma  you are not doing me justice   i know very well
that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends
yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature 
he may live twenty years longer   but thirty five has
nothing to do with matrimony  

 perhaps   said elinor   thirty five and seventeen had
better not have any thing to do with matrimony together 
but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman
who is single at seven and twenty  i should not think
colonel brandon s being thirty five any objection to his
marrying her  

 a woman of seven and twenty   said marianne 
after pausing a moment   can never hope to feel or inspire
affection again  and if her home be uncomfortable 
or her fortune small  i can suppose that she might
bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse 
for the sake of the provision and security of a wife 
in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be
nothing unsuitable   it would be a compact of convenience 
and the world would be satisfied   in my eyes it would
be no marriage at all  but that would be nothing 
to me it would seem only a commercial exchange  in which
each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other  

 it would be impossible  i know   replied elinor 
 to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could
feel for a man of thirty five anything near enough
to love  to make him a desirable companion to her 
but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and
his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber 
merely because he chanced to complain yesterday  a
very cold damp day  of a slight rheumatic feel in one
of his shoulders  

 but he talked of flannel waistcoats   said marianne 
 and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected
with aches  cramps  rheumatisms  and every species of
ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble  

 had he been only in a violent fever  you would not
have despised him half so much   confess  marianne  is not
there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek 
hollow eye  and quick pulse of a fever  

soon after this  upon elinor s leaving the room 
 mamma   said marianne   i have an alarm on the subject
of illness which i cannot conceal from you   i am sure
edward ferrars is not well   we have now been here almost
a fortnight  and yet he does not come   nothing but real
indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay 
what else can detain him at norland  

 had you any idea of his coming so soon  
said mrs  dashwood    i had none   on the contrary 
if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject  it has
been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want
of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation 
when i talked of his coming to barton   does elinor
expect him already  

 i have never mentioned it to her  but of course
she must  

 i rather think you are mistaken  for when i
was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate
for the spare bedchamber  she observed that there
was no immediate hurry for it  as it was not likely
that the room would be wanted for some time  

 how strange this is  what can be the meaning of it 
but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been
unaccountable  how cold  how composed were their last
adieus  how languid their conversation the last evening
of their being together  in edward s farewell there was no
distinction between elinor and me  it was the good wishes
of an affectionate brother to both   twice did i leave
them purposely together in the course of the last morning 
and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out
of the room   and elinor  in quitting norland and edward 
cried not as i did   even now her self command is invariable 
when is she dejected or melancholy  when does she try
to avoid society  or appear restless and dissatisfied
in it  



chapter 9


the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable
comfort to themselves   the house and the garden  with all
the objects surrounding them  were now become familiar 
and the ordinary pursuits which had given to norland
half its charms were engaged in again with far greater
enjoyment than norland had been able to afford  since the
loss of their father   sir john middleton  who called
on them every day for the first fortnight  and who was
not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home 
could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed 

their visitors  except those from barton park 
were not many  for  in spite of sir john s urgent entreaties
that they would mix more in the neighbourhood  and repeated
assurances of his carriage being always at their service 
the independence of mrs  dashwood s spirit overcame the
wish of society for her children  and she was resolute
in declining to visit any family beyond the distance
of a walk   there were but few who could be so classed 
and it was not all of them that were attainable 
about a mile and a half from the cottage  along the narrow
winding valley of allenham  which issued from that of barton 
as formerly described  the girls had  in one of their
earliest walks  discovered an ancient respectable looking
mansion which  by reminding them a little of norland 
interested their imagination and made them wish to be
better acquainted with it   but they learnt  on enquiry 
that its possessor  an elderly lady of very good character 
was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world 
and never stirred from home 

the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks 
the high downs which invited them from almost every window
of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air
on their summits  were a happy alternative when the dirt
of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties 
and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret
one memorable morning direct their steps  attracted by the
partial sunshine of a showery sky  and unable longer to bear
the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding
days had occasioned   the weather was not tempting enough
to draw the two others from their pencil and their book 
in spite of marianne s declaration that the day would
be lastingly fair  and that every threatening cloud would
be drawn off from their hills  and the two girls set off
together 

they gaily ascended the downs  rejoicing in their own
penetration at every glimpse of blue sky  and when they
caught in their faces the animating gales of a high
south westerly wind  they pitied the fears which had prevented
their mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations 

 is there a felicity in the world   said marianne 
 superior to this   margaret  we will walk here at least
two hours  

margaret agreed  and they pursued their way against
the wind  resisting it with laughing delight for about
twenty minutes longer  when suddenly the clouds united over
their heads  and a driving rain set full in their face   
chagrined and surprised  they were obliged  though unwillingly 
to turn back  for no shelter was nearer than their own house 
one consolation however remained for them  to which the
exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety 
it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep
side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate 

they set off   marianne had at first the advantage 
but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground 
and margaret  unable to stop herself to assist her 
was involuntarily hurried along  and reached the bottom
in safety 

a gentleman carrying a gun  with two pointers
playing round him  was passing up the hill and within
a few yards of marianne  when her accident happened 
he put down his gun and ran to her assistance   she had
raised herself from the ground  but her foot had been
twisted in her fall  and she was scarcely able to stand 
the gentleman offered his services  and perceiving that her
modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary 
took her up in his arms without farther delay  and carried
her down the hill   then passing through the garden 
the gate of which had been left open by margaret  he bore her
directly into the house  whither margaret was just arrived 
and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair
in the parlour 

elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at
their entrance  and while the eyes of both were fixed
on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration
which equally sprung from his appearance  he apologized
for his intrusion by relating its cause  in a manner
so frank and so graceful that his person  which was
uncommonly handsome  received additional charms from his voice
and expression   had he been even old  ugly  and vulgar 
the gratitude and kindness of mrs  dashwood would
have been secured by any act of attention to her child 
but the influence of youth  beauty  and elegance 
gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings 

she thanked him again and again  and  with a sweetness
of address which always attended her  invited him to
be seated   but this he declined  as he was dirty and wet 
mrs  dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged 
his name  he replied  was willoughby  and his present
home was at allenham  from whence he hoped she would
allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire
after miss dashwood   the honour was readily granted 
and he then departed  to make himself still more interesting 
in the midst of a heavy rain 

his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness
were instantly the theme of general admiration 
and the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne
received particular spirit from his exterior attractions   
marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest 
for the confusion which crimsoned over her face  on his
lifting her up  had robbed her of the power of regarding
him after their entering the house   but she had seen
enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others 
and with an energy which always adorned her praise 
his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever
drawn for the hero of a favourite story  and in his carrying
her into the house with so little previous formality  there
was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended
the action to her   every circumstance belonging to him
was interesting   his name was good  his residence was in
their favourite village  and she soon found out that of all
manly dresses a shooting jacket was the most becoming 
her imagination was busy  her reflections were pleasant 
and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded 

sir john called on them as soon as the next interval
of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out
of doors  and marianne s accident being related to him 
he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman
of the name of willoughby at allenham 

 willoughby   cried sir john   what  is he
in the country  that is good news however  i will
ride over tomorrow  and ask him to dinner on thursday  

 you know him then   said mrs  dashwood 

 know him  to be sure i do   why  he is down here
every year  

 and what sort of a young man is he  

 as good a kind of fellow as ever lived  i assure you 
a very decent shot  and there is not a bolder rider
in england  

 and is that all you can say for him   cried marianne 
indignantly    but what are his manners on more intimate
acquaintance  what his pursuits  his talents  and genius  

sir john was rather puzzled 

 upon my soul   said he   i do not know much about him
as to all that   but he is a pleasant  good humoured fellow 
and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer
i ever saw   was she out with him today  

but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the
colour of mr  willoughby s pointer  than he could
describe to her the shades of his mind 

 but who is he   said elinor    where does he come
from   has he a house at allenham  

on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence 
and he told them that mr  willoughby had no property
of his own in the country  that he resided there only
while he was visiting the old lady at allenham court 
to whom he was related  and whose possessions he was
to inherit  adding   yes  yes  he is very well worth
catching i can tell you  miss dashwood  he has a pretty
little estate of his own in somersetshire besides 
and if i were you  i would not give him up to my
younger sister  in spite of all this tumbling down hills 
miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself 
brandon will be jealous  if she does not take care  

 i do not believe   said mrs  dashwood  with a
good humoured smile   that mr  willoughby will be incommoded
by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what
you call catching him   it is not an employment to which
they have been brought up   men are very safe with us 
let them be ever so rich   i am glad to find  however 
from what you say  that he is a respectable young man 
and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible  

 he is as good a sort of fellow  i believe 
as ever lived   repeated sir john    i remember
last christmas at a little hop at the park  he danced
from eight o clock till four  without once sitting down  

 did he indeed   cried marianne with sparkling eyes 
 and with elegance  with spirit  

 yes  and he was up again at eight to ride to covert  

 that is what i like  that is what a young man ought
to be   whatever be his pursuits  his eagerness in them
should know no moderation  and leave him no sense of fatigue  

 aye  aye  i see how it will be   said sir john   i see
how it will be   you will be setting your cap at him now 
and never think of poor brandon  

 that is an expression  sir john   said marianne 
warmly   which i particularly dislike   i abhor every
common place phrase by which wit is intended  and  setting
one s cap at a man   or  making a conquest   are the most
odious of all   their tendency is gross and illiberal 
and if their construction could ever be deemed clever 
time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity  

sir john did not much understand this reproof 
but he laughed as heartily as if he did  and then replied 

 ay  you will make conquests enough  i dare say 
one way or other   poor brandon  he is quite smitten already 
and he is very well worth setting your cap at  i can
tell you  in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining
of ankles  



chapter 10


marianne s preserver  as margaret  with more elegance
than precision  styled willoughby  called at the cottage
early the next morning to make his personal enquiries 
he was received by mrs  dashwood with more than politeness 
with a kindness which sir john s account of him and her own
gratitude prompted  and every thing that passed during
the visit tended to assure him of the sense  elegance 
mutual affection  and domestic comfort of the family
to whom accident had now introduced him   of their
personal charms he had not required a second interview
to be convinced 

miss dashwood had a delicate complexion 
regular features  and a remarkably pretty figure 
marianne was still handsomer   her form  though not so
correct as her sister s  in having the advantage of height 
was more striking  and her face was so lovely  that when
in the common cant of praise  she was called a beautiful girl 
truth was less violently outraged than usually happens 
her skin was very brown  but  from its transparency 
her complexion was uncommonly brilliant  her features
were all good  her smile was sweet and attractive 
and in her eyes  which were very dark  there was a life 
a spirit  an eagerness  which could hardily be seen
without delight   from willoughby their expression was at
first held back  by the embarrassment which the remembrance
of his assistance created   but when this passed away 
when her spirits became collected  when she saw that to the
perfect good breeding of the gentleman  he united frankness
and vivacity  and above all  when she heard him declare 
that of music and dancing he was passionately fond 
she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the
largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest
of his stay 

it was only necessary to mention any favourite
amusement to engage her to talk   she could not be
silent when such points were introduced  and she
had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion 
they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing
and music was mutual  and that it arose from a general
conformity of judgment in all that related to either 
encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions 
she proceeded to question him on the subject of books 
her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt
upon with so rapturous a delight  that any young man of
five and twenty must have been insensible indeed  not to
become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works 
however disregarded before   their taste was strikingly alike 
the same books  the same passages were idolized by each  
or if any difference appeared  any objection arose 
it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments
and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed 
he acquiesced in all her decisions  caught all her enthusiasm 
and long before his visit concluded  they conversed
with the familiarity of a long established acquaintance 

 well  marianne   said elinor  as soon as he had left them 
 for one morning i think you have done pretty well 
you have already ascertained mr  willoughby s opinion in
almost every matter of importance   you know what he thinks
of cowper and scott  you are certain of his estimating
their beauties as he ought  and you have received every
assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper 
but how is your acquaintance to be long supported  under such
extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse 
you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic 
another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments
on picturesque beauty  and second marriages  and then
you can have nothing farther to ask    

 elinor   cried marianne   is this fair  is this
just  are my ideas so scanty   but i see what you mean 
i have been too much at my ease  too happy  too frank 
i have erred against every common place notion of decorum 
i have been open and sincere where i ought to have
been reserved  spiritless  dull  and deceitful  had
i talked only of the weather and the roads  and had i
spoken only once in ten minutes  this reproach would have
been spared  

 my love   said her mother   you must not be offended
with elinor  she was only in jest   i should scold
her myself  if she were capable of wishing to check
the delight of your conversation with our new friend    
marianne was softened in a moment 

willoughby  on his side  gave every proof of his
pleasure in their acquaintance  which an evident wish
of improving it could offer   he came to them every day 
to enquire after marianne was at first his excuse  but the
encouragement of his reception  to which every day gave
greater kindness  made such an excuse unnecessary before it
had ceased to be possible  by marianne s perfect recovery 
she was confined for some days to the house  but never had
any confinement been less irksome   willoughby was a young
man of good abilities  quick imagination  lively spirits 
and open  affectionate manners   he was exactly formed
to engage marianne s heart  for with all this  he joined
not only a captivating person  but a natural ardour
of mind which was now roused and increased by the example
of her own  and which recommended him to her affection
beyond every thing else 

his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment 
they read  they talked  they sang together  his musical
talents were considerable  and he read with all the
sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted 

in mrs  dashwood s estimation he was as faultless
as in marianne s  and elinor saw nothing to censure in him
but a propensity  in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly
delighted her sister  of saying too much what he thought on
every occasion  without attention to persons or circumstances 
in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people 
in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment
of undivided attention where his heart was engaged 
and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety 
he displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve 
in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support 

marianne began now to perceive that the desperation
which had seized her at sixteen and a half  of ever
seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection 
had been rash and unjustifiable   willoughby was all
that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour
and in every brighter period  as capable of attaching her 
and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect
as earnest  as his abilities were strong 

her mother too  in whose mind not one speculative
thought of their marriage had been raised  by his prospect
of riches  was led before the end of a week to hope and
expect it  and secretly to congratulate herself on having
gained two such sons in law as edward and willoughby 

colonel brandon s partiality for marianne  which had
so early been discovered by his friends  now first became
perceptible to elinor  when it ceased to be noticed
by them   their attention and wit were drawn off to his
more fortunate rival  and the raillery which the other
had incurred before any partiality arose  was removed
when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule
so justly annexed to sensibility   elinor was obliged 
though unwillingly  to believe that the sentiments which
mrs  jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction 
were now actually excited by her sister  and that however
a general resemblance of disposition between the parties
might forward the affection of mr  willoughby  an equally
striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the
regard of colonel brandon   she saw it with concern 
for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope 
when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty  and as
she could not even wish him successful  she heartily wished
him indifferent   she liked him  in spite of his gravity
and reserve  she beheld in him an object of interest 
his manners  though serious  were mild  and his reserve
appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits
than of any natural gloominess of temper   sir john
had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments 
which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man 
and she regarded him with respect and compassion 

perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more
because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne 
who  prejudiced against him for being neither lively
nor young  seemed resolved to undervalue his merits 

 brandon is just the kind of man   said willoughby
one day  when they were talking of him together 
 whom every body speaks well of  and nobody cares about 
whom all are delighted to see  and nobody remembers
to talk to  

 that is exactly what i think of him   cried marianne 

 do not boast of it  however   said elinor   for it
is injustice in both of you   he is highly esteemed
by all the family at the park  and i never see him myself
without taking pains to converse with him  

 that he is patronised by you   replied willoughby 
 is certainly in his favour  but as for the esteem
of the others  it is a reproach in itself   who would
submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman
as lady middleton and mrs  jennings  that could command
the indifference of any body else  

 but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself
and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady
middleton and her mother   if their praise is censure 
your censure may be praise  for they are not more undiscerning 
than you are prejudiced and unjust  

 in defence of your protege you can even be saucy  

 my protege  as you call him  is a sensible man 
and sense will always have attractions for me 
yes  marianne  even in a man between thirty and forty 
he has seen a great deal of the world  has been abroad 
has read  and has a thinking mind   i have found him
capable of giving me much information on various subjects 
and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of
good breeding and good nature  

 that is to say   cried marianne contemptuously 
 he has told you  that in the east indies the climate is hot 
and the mosquitoes are troublesome  

 he would have told me so  i doubt not  had i made
any such inquiries  but they happened to be points
on which i had been previously informed  

 perhaps   said willoughby   his observations may
have extended to the existence of nabobs  gold mohrs 
and palanquins  

 i may venture to say that his observations
have stretched much further than your candour 
but why should you dislike him  

 i do not dislike him   i consider him  on the contrary 
as a very respectable man  who has every body s good word 
and nobody s notice  who  has more money than he can spend 
more time than he knows how to employ  and two new coats
every year  

 add to which   cried marianne   that he has
neither genius  taste  nor spirit   that his understanding
has no brilliancy  his feelings no ardour  and his voice
no expression  

 you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass  
replied elinor   and so much on the strength of your
own imagination  that the commendation i am able to give
of him is comparatively cold and insipid   i can only
pronounce him to be a sensible man  well bred  well informed 
of gentle address  and  i believe  possessing an amiable heart  

 miss dashwood   cried willoughby   you are now using
me unkindly   you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason 
and to convince me against my will   but it will not do 
you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful   i have
three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon 
he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine 
he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle 
and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare   if it
will be any satisfaction to you  however  to be told 
that i believe his character to be in other respects
irreproachable  i am ready to confess it   and in return
for an acknowledgment  which must give me some pain 
you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much
as ever  



chapter 11


little had mrs  dashwood or her daughters imagined
when they first came into devonshire  that so many
engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly
presented themselves  or that they should have such frequent
invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little
leisure for serious employment   yet such was the case 
when marianne was recovered  the schemes of amusement at home
and abroad  which sir john had been previously forming 
were put into execution   the private balls at the park
then began  and parties on the water were made and
accomplished as often as a showery october would allow 
in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included 
and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended
these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing
intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods  to afford
him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne 
of marking his animated admiration of her  and of receiving 
in her behaviour to himself  the most pointed assurance
of her affection 

elinor could not be surprised at their attachment 
she only wished that it were less openly shewn  and once
or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some
self command to marianne   but marianne abhorred all
concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve 
and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not
in themselves illaudable  appeared to her not merely
an unnecessary effort  but a disgraceful subjection
of reason to common place and mistaken notions 
willoughby thought the same  and their behaviour at
all times  was an illustration of their opinions 

when he was present she had no eyes for any one else 
every thing he did  was right   every thing he said  was clever 
if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards 
he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get
her a good hand   if dancing formed the amusement
of the night  they were partners for half the time 
and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances 
were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word
to any body else   such conduct made them of course
most exceedingly laughed at  but ridicule could not shame 
and seemed hardly to provoke them 

mrs  dashwood entered into all their feelings with
a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this
excessive display of them   to her it was but the natural
consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind 

this was the season of happiness to marianne 
her heart was devoted to willoughby  and the fond attachment
to norland  which she brought with her from sussex 
was more likely to be softened than she had thought it
possible before  by the charms which his society bestowed
on her present home 

elinor s happiness was not so great   her heart was not
so much at ease  nor her satisfaction in their amusements
so pure   they afforded her no companion that could make
amends for what she had left behind  nor that could teach
her to think of norland with less regret than ever 
neither lady middleton nor mrs  jennings could supply
to her the conversation she missed  although the latter
was an everlasting talker  and from the first had regarded
her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of
her discourse   she had already repeated her own history
to elinor three or four times  and had elinor s memory been
equal to her means of improvement  she might have known
very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of
mr  jenning s last illness  and what he said to his wife
a few minutes before he died   lady middleton was more
agreeable than her mother only in being more silent 
elinor needed little observation to perceive that her
reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense
had nothing to do   towards her husband and mother she
was the same as to them  and intimacy was therefore
neither to be looked for nor desired   she had nothing
to say one day that she had not said the day before 
her insipidity was invariable  for even her spirits were
always the same  and though she did not oppose the parties
arranged by her husband  provided every thing were conducted
in style and her two eldest children attended her 
she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them
than she might have experienced in sitting at home   
and so little did her presence add to the pleasure
of the others  by any share in their conversation 
that they were sometimes only reminded of her being
amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys 

in colonel brandon alone  of all her new acquaintance 
did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the
respect of abilities  excite the interest of friendship 
or give pleasure as a companion   willoughby was out
of the question   her admiration and regard  even her
sisterly regard  was all his own  but he was a lover 
his attentions were wholly marianne s  and a far less
agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing 
colonel brandon  unfortunately for himself  had no such
encouragement to think only of marianne  and in conversing
with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the
indifference of her sister 

elinor s compassion for him increased  as she had reason
to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already
been known to him   this suspicion was given by some words
which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park 
when they were sitting down together by mutual consent 
while the others were dancing   his eyes were fixed
on marianne  and  after a silence of some minutes 
he said  with a faint smile   your sister  i understand 
does not approve of second attachments  

 no   replied elinor   her opinions are all romantic  

 or rather  as i believe  she considers them
impossible to exist  

 i believe she does   but how she contrives it
without reflecting on the character of her own father 
who had himself two wives  i know not   a few years
however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis
of common sense and observation  and then they may be
more easy to define and to justify than they now are 
by any body but herself  

 this will probably be the case   he replied 
 and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices
of a young mind  that one is sorry to see them give way
to the reception of more general opinions  

 i cannot agree with you there   said elinor 
 there are inconveniences attending such feelings
as marianne s  which all the charms of enthusiasm and
ignorance of the world cannot atone for   her systems have
all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought 
and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look
forward to as her greatest possible advantage  

after a short pause he resumed the conversation
by saying   

 does your sister make no distinction in her objections
against a second attachment  or is it equally criminal
in every body   are those who have been disappointed
in their first choice  whether from the inconstancy
of its object  or the perverseness of circumstances 
to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives  

 upon my word  i am not acquainted with the minutiae
of her principles   i only know that i never yet heard her
admit any instance of a second attachment s being pardonable  

 this   said he   cannot hold  but a change 
a total change of sentiments  no  no  do not desire it 
for when the romantic refinements of a young mind
are obliged to give way  how frequently are they
succeeded by such opinions as are but too common  and too
dangerous   i speak from experience   i once knew a lady
who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister 
who thought and judged like her  but who from an inforced
change  from a series of unfortunate circumstances   
here he stopt suddenly  appeared to think that he had said
too much  and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures 
which might not otherwise have entered elinor s head 
the lady would probably have passed without suspicion 
had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned
her ought not to escape his lips   as it was 
it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his
emotion with the tender recollection of past regard 
elinor attempted no more   but marianne  in her place 
would not have done so little   the whole story would
have been speedily formed under her active imagination 
and every thing established in the most melancholy order
of disastrous love 



chapter 12


as elinor and marianne were walking together the
next morning the latter communicated a piece of news
to her sister  which in spite of all that she knew
before of marianne s imprudence and want of thought 
surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both 
marianne told her  with the greatest delight  that
willoughby had given her a horse  one that he had bred
himself on his estate in somersetshire  and which was
exactly calculated to carry a woman   without considering
that it was not in her mother s plan to keep any horse 
that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of
this gift  she must buy another for the servant  and
keep a servant to ride it  and after all  build a stable
to receive them  she had accepted the present without
hesitation  and told her sister of it in raptures 

 he intends to send his groom into somersetshire
immediately for it   she added   and when it arrives we
will ride every day   you shall share its use with me 
imagine to yourself  my dear elinor  the delight of a gallop
on some of these downs  

most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of
felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended
the affair  and for some time she refused to submit to them 
as to an additional servant  the expense would be a trifle 
mamma she was sure would never object to it  and any horse
would do for him  he might always get one at the park 
as to a stable  the merest shed would be sufficient 
elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving
such a present from a man so little  or at least so lately
known to her   this was too much 

 you are mistaken  elinor   said she warmly 
 in supposing i know very little of willoughby 
i have not known him long indeed  but i am much better
acquainted with him  than i am with any other creature
in the world  except yourself and mama   it is not
time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy   
it is disposition alone   seven years would be insufficient
to make some people acquainted with each other  and seven
days are more than enough for others   i should hold
myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse
from my brother  than from willoughby   of john i know
very little  though we have lived together for years 
but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed  

elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more 
she knew her sister s temper   opposition on so tender a
subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion 
but by an appeal to her affection for her mother 
by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent
mother must draw on herself  if  as would probably be
the case  she consented to this increase of establishment 
marianne was shortly subdued  and she promised not to
tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning
the offer  and to tell willoughby when she saw him next 
that it must be declined 

she was faithful to her word  and when willoughby
called at the cottage  the same day  elinor heard her
express her disappointment to him in a low voice  on
being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present 
the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related 
and they were such as to make further entreaty on his
side impossible   his concern however was very apparent 
and after expressing it with earnestness  he added 
in the same low voice    but  marianne  the horse is
still yours  though you cannot use it now   i shall keep
it only till you can claim it   when you leave barton
to form your own establishment in a more lasting home 
queen mab shall receive you  

this was all overheard by miss dashwood  and in the
whole of the sentence  in his manner of pronouncing it 
and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone 
she instantly saw an intimacy so decided  a meaning
so direct  as marked a perfect agreement between them 
from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged
to each other  and the belief of it created no other surprise
than that she  or any of their friends  should be left
by tempers so frank  to discover it by accident 

margaret related something to her the next day 
which placed this matter in a still clearer light 
willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them 
and margaret  by being left some time in the parlour
with only him and marianne  had had opportunity
for observations  which  with a most important face 
she communicated to her eldest sister  when they were
next by themselves 

 oh  elinor   she cried   i have such a secret to
tell you about marianne   i am sure she will be married
to mr  willoughby very soon  

 you have said so   replied elinor   almost every
day since they first met on high church down  and they
had not known each other a week  i believe  before you
were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck 
but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle  

 but indeed this is quite another thing   i am sure
they will be married very soon  for he has got a lock
of her hair  

 take care  margaret   it may be only the hair
of some great uncle of his  

 but  indeed  elinor  it is marianne s  i am almost
sure it is  for i saw him cut it off   last night
after tea  when you and mama went out of the room 
they were whispering and talking together as fast as
could be  and he seemed to be begging something of her 
and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long
lock of her hair  for it was all tumbled down her back 
and he kissed it  and folded it up in a piece of white paper 
and put it into his pocket book  

for such particulars  stated on such authority 
elinor could not withhold her credit  nor was she disposed
to it  for the circumstance was in perfect unison with
what she had heard and seen herself 

margaret s sagacity was not always displayed in a
way so satisfactory to her sister   when mrs  jennings
attacked her one evening at the park  to give the name
of the young man who was elinor s particular favourite 
which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her 
margaret answered by looking at her sister  and saying 
 i must not tell  may i  elinor  

this of course made every body laugh  and elinor
tried to laugh too   but the effort was painful 
she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person
whose name she could not bear with composure to become
a standing joke with mrs  jennings 

marianne felt for her most sincerely  but she did
more harm than good to the cause  by turning very red
and saying in an angry manner to margaret 

 remember that whatever your conjectures may be 
you have no right to repeat them  

 i never had any conjectures about it   replied margaret 
 it was you who told me of it yourself  

this increased the mirth of the company  and margaret
was eagerly pressed to say something more 

 oh  pray  miss margaret  let us know all about it  
said mrs  jennings    what is the gentleman s name  

 i must not tell  ma am  but i know very well what it is 
and i know where he is too  

 yes  yes  we can guess where he is  at his own house
at norland to be sure   he is the curate of the parish
i dare say  

 no  that he is not   he is of no profession at all  

 margaret   said marianne with great warmth 
 you know that all this is an invention of your own 
and that there is no such person in existence  

 well  then  he is lately dead  marianne  for i
am sure there was such a man once  and his name begins
with an f  

most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton
for observing  at this moment   that it rained very hard  
though she believed the interruption to proceed less from
any attention to her  than from her ladyship s great dislike
of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted
her husband and mother   the idea however started by her 
was immediately pursued by colonel brandon  who was
on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others 
and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them 
willoughby opened the piano forte  and asked marianne
to sit down to it  and thus amidst the various endeavours
of different people to quit the topic  it fell to the ground 
but not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into
which it had thrown her 

a party was formed this evening for going on the
following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles
from barton  belonging to a brother in law of colonel brandon 
without whose interest it could not be seen  as the proprietor 
who was then abroad  had left strict orders on that head 
the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful 
and sir john  who was particularly warm in their praise 
might be allowed to be a tolerable judge  for he had
formed parties to visit them  at least  twice every summer
for the last ten years   they contained a noble piece
of water  a sail on which was to a form a great part of
the morning s amusement  cold provisions were to be taken 
open carriages only to be employed  and every thing
conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure 

to some few of the company it appeared rather
a bold undertaking  considering the time of year 
and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight   
and mrs  dashwood  who had already a cold  was persuaded
by elinor to stay at home 



chapter 13


their intended excursion to whitwell turned out
very different from what elinor had expected   she was
prepared to be wet through  fatigued  and frightened 
but the event was still more unfortunate  for they did
not go at all 

by ten o clock the whole party was assembled at
the park  where they were to breakfast   the morning
was rather favourable  though it had rained all night 
as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky 
and the sun frequently appeared   they were all in high
spirits and good humour  eager to be happy  and determined
to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships
rather than be otherwise 

while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in 
among the rest there was one for colonel brandon   he
took it  looked at the direction  changed colour 
and immediately left the room 

 what is the matter with brandon   said sir john 

nobody could tell 

 i hope he has had no bad news   said lady middleton 
 it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel
brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly  

in about five minutes he returned 

 no bad news  colonel  i hope   said mrs  jennings 
as soon as he entered the room 

 none at all  ma am  i thank you  

 was it from avignon   i hope it is not to say
that your sister is worse  

 no  ma am  it came from town  and is merely
a letter of business  

 but how came the hand to discompose you so much 
if it was only a letter of business   come  come 
this won t do  colonel  so let us hear the truth of it  

 my dear madam   said lady middleton   recollect what
you are saying  

 perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny
is married   said mrs  jennings  without attending
to her daughter s reproof 

 no  indeed  it is not  

 well  then  i know who it is from  colonel   and i
hope she is well  

 whom do you mean  ma am   said he  colouring a little 

 oh  you know who i mean  

 i am particularly sorry  ma am   said he 
addressing lady middleton   that i should receive this
letter today  for it is on business which requires
my immediate attendance in town  

 in town   cried mrs  jennings    what can you
have to do in town at this time of year  

 my own loss is great   be continued   in being obliged
to leave so agreeable a party  but i am the more concerned 
as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance
at whitwell  

what a blow upon them all was this 

 but if you write a note to the housekeeper  mr  brandon  
said marianne  eagerly   will it not be sufficient  

he shook his head 

 we must go   said sir john    it shall not be put
off when we are so near it   you cannot go to town till
tomorrow  brandon  that is all  

 i wish it could be so easily settled   but it
is not in my power to delay my journey for one day  

 if you would but let us know what your business is  
said mrs  jennings   we might see whether it could be put
off or not  

 you would not be six hours later   said willoughby 
 if you were to defer your journey till our return  

 i cannot afford to lose one hour    

elinor then heard willoughby say  in a low voice to marianne 
 there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure 
brandon is one of them   he was afraid of catching cold
i dare say  and invented this trick for getting out of it 
i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing  

 i have no doubt of it   replied marianne 

 there is no persuading you to change your mind 
brandon  i know of old   said sir john   when once you
are determined on anything   but  however  i hope you
will think better of it   consider  here are the two miss
careys come over from newton  the three miss dashwoods
walked up from the cottage  and mr  willoughby got up
two hours before his usual time  on purpose to go to whitwell  

colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being
the cause of disappointing the party  but at the same
time declared it to be unavoidable 

 well  then  when will you come back again  

 i hope we shall see you at barton   added her ladyship 
 as soon as you can conveniently leave town  and we must
put off the party to whitwell till you return  

 you are very obliging   but it is so uncertain 
when i may have it in my power to return  that i dare
not engage for it at all  

 oh  he must and shall come back   cried sir john 
 if he is not here by the end of the week  i shall go
after him  

 ay  so do  sir john   cried mrs  jennings   and then
perhaps you may find out what his business is  

 i do not want to pry into other men s concerns 
i suppose it is something he is ashamed of  

colonel brandon s horses were announced 

 you do not go to town on horseback  do you  
added sir john 

 no  only to honiton   i shall then go post  

 well  as you are resolved to go  i wish you
a good journey   but you had better change your mind  

 i assure you it is not in my power  

he then took leave of the whole party 

 is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters
in town this winter  miss dashwood  

 i am afraid  none at all  

 then i must bid you farewell for a longer time
than i should wish to do  

to marianne  he merely bowed and said nothing 

 come colonel   said mrs  jennings   before you go 
do let us know what you are going about  

he wished her a good morning  and  attended by sir john 
left the room 

the complaints and lamentations which politeness
had hitherto restrained  now burst forth universally 
and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was
to be so disappointed 

 i can guess what his business is  however  
said mrs  jennings exultingly 

 can you  ma am   said almost every body 

 yes  it is about miss williams  i am sure  

 and who is miss williams   asked marianne 

 what  do not you know who miss williams is  i am
sure you must have heard of her before   she is a relation
of the colonel s  my dear  a very near relation   we will
not say how near  for fear of shocking the young ladies  
then  lowering her voice a little  she said to elinor 
 she is his natural daughter  

 indeed  

 oh  yes  and as like him as she can stare 
i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune  

when sir john returned  he joined most heartily
in the general regret on so unfortunate an event 
concluding however by observing  that as they were
all got together  they must do something by way of
being happy  and after some consultation it was agreed 
that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell 
they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving
about the country   the carriages were then ordered 
willoughby s was first  and marianne never looked
happier than when she got into it   he drove through
the park very fast  and they were soon out of sight 
and nothing more of them was seen till their return 
which did not happen till after the return of all the rest 
they both seemed delighted with their drive  but said
only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes 
while the others went on the downs 

it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening 
and that every body should be extremely merry all day long 
some more of the careys came to dinner  and they had the
pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table  which sir
john observed with great contentment   willoughby took
his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods 
mrs  jennings sat on elinor s right hand  and they had not
been long seated  before she leant behind her and willoughby 
and said to marianne  loud enough for them both to hear 
 i have found you out in spite of all your tricks 
i know where you spent the morning  

marianne coloured  and replied very hastily 
 where  pray    

 did not you know   said willoughby   that we had
been out in my curricle  

 yes  yes  mr  impudence  i know that very well 
and i was determined to find out where you had been to   
i hope you like your house  miss marianne   it is a very
large one  i know  and when i come to see you  i hope you
will have new furnished it  for it wanted it very much
when i was there six years ago  

marianne turned away in great confusion 
mrs  jennings laughed heartily  and elinor found that in her
resolution to know where they had been  she had actually
made her own woman enquire of mr  willoughby s groom 
and that she had by that method been informed that they
had gone to allenham  and spent a considerable time there
in walking about the garden and going all over the house 

elinor could hardly believe this to be true 
as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose 
or marianne consent  to enter the house while mrs  smith was
in it  with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance 

as soon as they left the dining room  elinor enquired
of her about it  and great was her surprise when she
found that every circumstance related by mrs  jennings
was perfectly true   marianne was quite angry with her
for doubting it 

 why should you imagine  elinor  that we did not
go there  or that we did not see the house   is not it
what you have often wished to do yourself  

 yes  marianne  but i would not go while mrs  smith
was there  and with no other companion than mr  willoughby  

 mr  willoughby however is the only person who can
have a right to shew that house  and as he went in an open
carriage  it was impossible to have any other companion 
i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life  

 i am afraid   replied elinor   that the pleasantness
of an employment does not always evince its propriety  

 on the contrary  nothing can be a stronger proof
of it  elinor  for if there had been any real impropriety
in what i did  i should have been sensible of it at
the time  for we always know when we are acting wrong 
and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure  

 but  my dear marianne  as it has already exposed you
to some very impertinent remarks  do you not now begin
to doubt the discretion of your own conduct  

 if the impertinent remarks of mrs  jennings are
to be the proof of impropriety in conduct  we are all
offending every moment of our lives   i value not her
censure any more than i should do her commendation 
i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking
over mrs  smith s grounds  or in seeing her house 
they will one day be mr  willoughby s  and   

 if they were one day to be your own  marianne 
you would not be justified in what you have done  

she blushed at this hint  but it was even visibly
gratifying to her  and after a ten minutes  interval of
earnest thought  she came to her sister again  and said
with great good humour   perhaps  elinor  it was rather
ill judged in me to go to allenham  but mr  willoughby wanted
particularly to shew me the place  and it is a charming house 
i assure you   there is one remarkably pretty sitting room
up stairs  of a nice comfortable size for constant use 
and with modern furniture it would be delightful 
it is a corner room  and has windows on two sides 
on one side you look across the bowling green  behind
the house  to a beautiful hanging wood  and on the other you
have a view of the church and village  and  beyond them 
of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired 
i did not see it to advantage  for nothing could be
more forlorn than the furniture   but if it were newly
fitted up  a couple of hundred pounds  willoughby says 
would make it one of the pleasantest summer rooms
in england  

could elinor have listened to her without interruption
from the others  she would have described every room
in the house with equal delight 



chapter 14


the sudden termination of colonel brandon s visit
at the park  with his steadiness in concealing its cause 
filled the mind  and raised the wonder of mrs  jennings
for two or three days  she was a great wonderer  as every
one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the
comings and goings of all their acquaintance   she wondered 
with little intermission what could be the reason of it 
was sure there must be some bad news  and thought over
every kind of distress that could have befallen him 
with a fixed determination that he should not escape
them all 

 something very melancholy must be the matter 
i am sure   said she    i could see it in his face 
poor man   i am afraid his circumstances may be bad 
the estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand
a year  and his brother left everything sadly involved 
i do think he must have been sent for about money matters 
for what else can it be   i wonder whether it is so 
i would give anything to know the truth of it   perhaps it
is about miss williams and  by the bye  i dare say it is 
because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her 
may be she is ill in town  nothing in the world more likely 
for i have a notion she is always rather sickly 
i would lay any wager it is about miss williams 
it is not so very likely he should be distressed in
his circumstances now  for he is a very prudent man 
and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time 
i wonder what it can be   may be his sister is worse
at avignon  and has sent for him over   his setting off
in such a hurry seems very like it   well  i wish him out
of all his trouble with all my heart  and a good wife into
the bargain  

so wondered  so talked mrs  jennings   her opinion
varying with every fresh conjecture  and all seeming
equally probable as they arose   elinor  though she felt
really interested in the welfare of colonel brandon 
could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly
away  which mrs  jennings was desirous of her feeling 
for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion
justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation 
her wonder was otherwise disposed of   it was engrossed
by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby
on the subject  which they must know to be peculiarly
interesting to them all   as this silence continued 
every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible
with the disposition of both   why they should not openly
acknowledge to her mother and herself  what their constant
behaviour to each other declared to have taken place 
elinor could not imagine 

she could easily conceive that marriage might not
be immediately in their power  for though willoughby
was independent  there was no reason to believe him rich 
his estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven
hundred a year  but he lived at an expense to which that income
could hardly be equal  and he had himself often complained
of his poverty   but for this strange kind of secrecy
maintained by them relative to their engagement  which
in fact concealed nothing at all  she could not account 
and it was so wholly contradictory to their general
opinions and practice  that a doubt sometimes entered
her mind of their being really engaged  and this doubt
was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne 

nothing could be more expressive of attachment
to them all  than willoughby s behaviour   to marianne
it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover s
heart could give  and to the rest of the family it was the
affectionate attention of a son and a brother   the cottage
seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home 
many more of his hours were spent there than at allenham 
and if no general engagement collected them at the park 
the exercise which called him out in the morning was
almost certain of ending there  where the rest of the day
was spent by himself at the side of marianne  and by his
favourite pointer at her feet 

one evening in particular  about a week after
colonel brandon left the country  his heart seemed
more than usually open to every feeling of attachment
to the objects around him  and on mrs  dashwood s
happening to mention her design of improving the cottage
in the spring  he warmly opposed every alteration
of a place which affection had established as perfect with him 

 what   he exclaimed   improve this dear cottage 
no  that i will never consent to   not a stone must
be added to its walls  not an inch to its size 
if my feelings are regarded  

 do not be alarmed   said miss dashwood 
 nothing of the kind will be done  for my mother
will never have money enough to attempt it  

 i am heartily glad of it   he cried    may she
always be poor  if she can employ her riches no better  

 thank you  willoughby   but you may be assured that i
would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment
of yours  or of any one whom i loved  for all the improvements
in the world   depend upon it that whatever unemployed
sum may remain  when i make up my accounts in the spring 
i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose
of it in a manner so painful to you   but are you really
so attached to this place as to see no defect in it  

 i am   said he    to me it is faultless   nay  more 
i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness
is attainable  and were i rich enough i would instantly pull
combe down  and build it up again in the exact plan of this
cottage  

 with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes 
i suppose   said elinor 

 yes   cried he in the same eager tone   with all
and every thing belonging to it   in no one convenience
or inconvenience about it  should the least variation
be perceptible   then  and then only  under such a roof  i
might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton  

 i flatter myself   replied elinor   that even under
the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase 
you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you
now do this  

 there certainly are circumstances   said willoughby 
 which might greatly endear it to me  but this place will
always have one claim of my affection  which no other can
possibly share  

mrs  dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne 
whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby 
as plainly denoted how well she understood him 

 how often did i wish   added he   when i was at
allenham this time twelvemonth  that barton cottage were
inhabited   i never passed within view of it without admiring
its situation  and grieving that no one should live in it 
how little did i then think that the very first news
i should hear from mrs  smith  when i next came into
the country  would be that barton cottage was taken  and i
felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event 
which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i
should experience from it  can account for   must it not have
been so  marianne   speaking to her in a lowered voice 
then continuing his former tone  he said   and yet this
house you would spoil  mrs  dashwood   you would rob it
of its simplicity by imaginary improvement  and this dear
parlour in which our acquaintance first began  and in which
so many happy hours have been since spent by us together 
you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance 
and every body would be eager to pass through the room
which has hitherto contained within itself more real
accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of
the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford  

mrs  dashwood again assured him that no alteration
of the kind should be attempted 

 you are a good woman   he warmly replied 
 your promise makes me easy   extend it a little farther 
and it will make me happy   tell me that not only your
house will remain the same  but that i shall ever find
you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling  and that you
will always consider me with the kindness which has made
everything belonging to you so dear to me  

the promise was readily given  and willoughby s
behaviour during the whole of the evening declared
at once his affection and happiness 

 shall we see you tomorrow to dinner   said mrs  dashwood 
when he was leaving them    i do not ask you to come in
the morning  for we must walk to the park  to call on lady
middleton  

he engaged to be with them by four o clock 



chapter 15


mrs  dashwood s visit to lady middleton took place
the next day  and two of her daughters went with her 
but marianne excused herself from being of the party 
under some trifling pretext of employment  and her mother 
who concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby
the night before of calling on her while they were absent 
was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home 

on their return from the park they found willoughby s
curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage 
and mrs  dashwood was convinced that her conjecture
had been just   so far it was all as she had foreseen 
but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight
had taught her to expect   they were no sooner in the
passage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour
apparently in violent affliction  with her handkerchief
at her eyes  and without noticing them ran up stairs 
surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room
she had just quitted  where they found only willoughby 
who was leaning against the mantel piece with his back
towards them   he turned round on their coming in 
and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook
of the emotion which over powered marianne 

 is anything the matter with her   cried mrs  dashwood
as she entered   is she ill  

 i hope not   he replied  trying to look cheerful 
and with a forced smile presently added   it is i who may
rather expect to be ill  for i am now suffering under a
very heavy disappointment  

 disappointment  

 yes  for i am unable to keep my engagement with you 
mrs  smith has this morning exercised the privilege
of riches upon a poor dependent cousin  by sending me on
business to london   i have just received my dispatches 
and taken my farewell of allenham  and by way of exhilaration
i am now come to take my farewell of you  

 to london   and are you going this morning  

 almost this moment  

 this is very unfortunate   but mrs  smith must
be obliged   and her business will not detain you from
us long i hope  

he coloured as he replied   you are very kind  but i
have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately 
my visits to mrs  smith are never repeated within
the twelvemonth  

 and is mrs  smith your only friend   is allenham the only
house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome 
for shame  willoughby  can you wait for an invitation here  

his colour increased  and with his eyes fixed
on the ground he only replied   you are too good  

mrs  dashwood looked at elinor with surprise 
elinor felt equal amazement   for a few moments every one
was silent   mrs  dashwood first spoke 

 i have only to add  my dear willoughby  that at
barton cottage you will always be welcome  for i will not
press you to return here immediately  because you only
can judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs  smith 
and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question
your judgment than to doubt your inclination  

 my engagements at present   replied willoughby 
confusedly   are of such a nature  that  i dare not flatter
myself   

he stopt   mrs  dashwood was too much astonished
to speak  and another pause succeeded   this was broken
by willoughby  who said with a faint smile   it is folly
to linger in this manner   i will not torment myself
any longer by remaining among friends whose society
it is impossible for me now to enjoy  

he then hastily took leave of them all and left
the room   they saw him step into his carriage 
and in a minute it was out of sight 

mrs  dashwood felt too much for speech  and instantly
quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern
and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned 

elinor s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother s 
she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust 
willoughby s behaviour in taking leave of them  his
embarrassment 
and affectation of cheerfulness  and  above all  his
unwillingness
to accept her mother s invitation  a backwardness so unlike a
lover 
so unlike himself  greatly disturbed her   one moment she feared
that no serious design had ever been formed on his side  and the
next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him
and
her sister   the distress in which marianne had quitted the room
was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for 
though when she considered what marianne s love for him was 
a quarrel seemed almost impossible 

but whatever might be the particulars of their separation 
her sister s affliction was indubitable  and she thought
with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow
which marianne was in all probability not merely giving
way to as a relief  but feeding and encouraging as a duty 

in about half an hour her mother returned  and though
her eyes were red  her countenance was not uncheerful 

 our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton  elinor  
said she  as she sat down to work   and with how heavy a heart
does he travel  

 it is all very strange   so suddenly to be gone  it
seems but the work of a moment   and last night he was
with us so happy  so cheerful  so affectionate   and now 
after only ten minutes notice  gone too without intending
to return   something more than what be owned to us must
have happened   he did not speak  he did not behave
like himself   you must have seen the difference as well as i 
what can it be   can they have quarrelled   why else should he
have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here    

 it was not inclination that he wanted  elinor  i could
plainly see that   he had not the power of accepting it 
i have thought it all over i assure you  and i can
perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed
strange to me as well as to you  

 can you  indeed  

 yes  i have explained it to myself in the most
satisfactory way   but you  elinor  who love to doubt
where you can  it will not satisfy you  i know  but you
shall not talk me out of my trust in it   i am persuaded
that mrs  smith suspects his regard for marianne 
disapproves of it   perhaps because she has other views
for him   and on that account is eager to get him away   
and that the business which she sends him off to transact
is invented as an excuse to dismiss him   this is what i
believe to have happened   he is  moreover  aware that she
does disapprove the connection  he dares not therefore
at present confess to her his engagement with marianne 
and he feels himself obliged  from his dependent situation 
to give into her schemes  and absent himself from
devonshire for a while   you will tell me  i know 
that this may or may not have happened  but i will listen
to no cavil  unless you can point out any other method
of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this 
and now  elinor  what have you to say  

 nothing  for you have anticipated my answer  

 then you would have told me  that it might or might not
have happened   oh  elinor  how incomprehensible are your
feelings   you had rather take evil upon credit than good 
you had rather look out for misery for marianne  and guilt
for poor willoughby  than an apology for the latter 
you are resolved to think him blameable  because he took
leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour
has shewn   and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence 
or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment   are
no probabilities to be accepted  merely because they
are not certainties   is nothing due to the man whom we
have all such reason to love  and no reason in the world
to think ill of   to the possibility of motives unanswerable
in themselves  though unavoidably secret for a while   and 
after all  what is it you suspect him of  

 i can hardly tell myself   but suspicion of
something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence
of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him 
there is great truth  however  in what you have now urged
of the allowances which ought to be made for him  and it
is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body 
willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient
reasons for his conduct  and i will hope that he has 
but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge
them at once   secrecy may be advisable  but still i
cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him  

 do not blame him  however  for departing from
his character  where the deviation is necessary 
but you really do admit the justice of what i have said
in his defence   i am happy  and he is acquitted  

 not entirely   it may be proper to conceal their
engagement  if they are engaged  from mrs  smith  
and if that is the case  it must be highly expedient
for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present 
but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us  

 concealing it from us  my dear child  do you accuse
willoughby and marianne of concealment  this is strange
indeed  when your eyes have been reproaching them every day
for incautiousness  

 i want no proof of their affection   said elinor 
 but of their engagement i do  

 i am perfectly satisfied of both  

 yet not a syllable has been said to you on the
subject  by either of them  

 i have not wanted syllables where actions have
spoken so plainly   has not his behaviour to marianne
and to all of us  for at least the last fortnight 
declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife 
and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest
relation   have we not perfectly understood each other 
has not my consent been daily asked by his looks  his manner 
his attentive and affectionate respect   my elinor 
is it possible to doubt their engagement   how could
such a thought occur to you   how is it to be supposed
that willoughby  persuaded as he must be of your
sister s love  should leave her  and leave her perhaps
for months  without telling her of his affection   that
they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence  

 i confess   replied elinor   that every circumstance
except one is in favour of their engagement 
but that one is the total silence of both on the subject 
and with me it almost outweighs every other  

 how strange this is   you must think wretchedly indeed
of willoughby  if  after all that has openly passed between them 
you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together 
has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister
all this time   do you suppose him really indifferent to her  

 no  i cannot think that   he must and does love her
i am sure  

 but with a strange kind of tenderness  if he can
leave her with such indifference  such carelessness
of the future  as you attribute to him  

 you must remember  my dear mother  that i have never
considered this matter as certain   i have had my doubts 
i confess  but they are fainter than they were  and they
may soon be entirely done away   if we find they correspond 
every fear of mine will be removed  

 a mighty concession indeed   if you were to see
them at the altar  you would suppose they were going to
be married   ungracious girl   but i require no such proof 
nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt 
no secrecy has been attempted  all has been uniformly open
and unreserved   you cannot doubt your sister s wishes 
it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect   but why 
is he not a man of honour and feeling  has there been any
inconsistency on his side to create alarm  can he be deceitful  

 i hope not  i believe not   cried elinor 
 i love willoughby  sincerely love him  and suspicion of his
integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me 
it has been involuntary  and i will not encourage it 
i was startled  i confess  by the alteration in his
manners this morning   he did not speak like himself 
and did not return your kindness with any cordiality 
but all this may be explained by such a situation of his
affairs as you have supposed   he had just parted from
my sister  had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction 
and if he felt obliged  from a fear of offending mrs  smith 
to resist the temptation of returning here soon  and yet
aware that by declining your invitation  by saying
that he was going away for some time  he should seem
to act an ungenerous  a suspicious part by our family 
be might well be embarrassed and disturbed   in such a case 
a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been
more to his honour i think  as well as more consistent
with his general character   but i will not raise objections
against any one s conduct on so illiberal a foundation 
as a difference in judgment from myself  or a deviation from
what i may think right and consistent  

 you speak very properly   willoughby certainly does
not deserve to be suspected   though we have not known
him long  he is no stranger in this part of the world 
and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage   had he been
in a situation to act independently and marry immediately 
it might have been odd that he should leave us without
acknowledging everything to me at once  but this is not the case 
it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun 
for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance 
and even secrecy  as far as it can be observed  may now
be very advisable  

they were interrupted by the entrance of margaret 
and elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations
of her mother  to acknowledge the probability of many 
and hope for the justice of all 

they saw nothing of marianne till dinner time 
when she entered the room and took her place at the table
without saying a word   her eyes were red and swollen 
and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained
with difficulty   she avoided the looks of them all 
could neither eat nor speak  and after some time  on her
mother s silently pressing her hand with tender compassion 
her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome  she burst
into tears and left the room 

this violent oppression of spirits continued the
whole evening   she was without any power  because she
was without any desire of command over herself 
the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby
overpowered her in an instant  and though her family
were most anxiously attentive to her comfort  it was
impossible for them  if they spoke at all  to keep clear
of every subject which her feelings connected with him 



chapter 16


marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable
had she been able to sleep at all the first night
after parting from willoughby   she would have been
ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning 
had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose
than when she lay down in it   but the feelings which
made such composure a disgrace  left her in no danger
of incurring it   she was awake the whole night  and she
wept the greatest part of it   she got up with a headache 
was unable to talk  and unwilling to take any nourishment 
giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters 
and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either 
her sensibility was potent enough 

when breakfast was over she walked out by herself 
and wandered about the village of allenham  indulging the
recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present
reverse for the chief of the morning 

the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling 
she played over every favourite song that she had been used
to play to willoughby  every air in which their voices
had been oftenest joined  and sat at the instrument gazing
on every line of music that he had written out for her 
till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness
could be gained  and this nourishment of grief was every
day applied   she spent whole hours at the pianoforte
alternately singing and crying  her voice often totally
suspended by her tears   in books too  as well as in music 
she courted the misery which a contrast between the past
and present was certain of giving   she read nothing
but what they had been used to read together 

such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported
for ever  it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy 
but these employments  to which she daily recurred 
her solitary walks and silent meditations  still produced
occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever 

no letter from willoughby came  and none seemed expected
by marianne   her mother was surprised  and elinor again
became uneasy   but mrs  dashwood could find explanations
whenever she wanted them  which at least satisfied herself 

 remember  elinor   said she   how very often sir john
fetches our letters himself from the post  and carries them
to it   we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary 
and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if
their correspondence were to pass through sir john s hands  

elinor could not deny the truth of this  and she tried
to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence 
but there was one method so direct  so simple  and in
her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state
of the affair  and of instantly removing all mystery 
that she could not help suggesting it to her mother 

 why do you not ask marianne at once   said she 
 whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby   from you 
her mother  and so kind  so indulgent a mother  the question
could not give offence   it would be the natural result
of your affection for her   she used to be all unreserve 
and to you more especially  

 i would not ask such a question for the world 
supposing it possible that they are not engaged 
what distress would not such an enquiry inflict   at any
rate it would be most ungenerous   i should never deserve
her confidence again  after forcing from her a confession
of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one 
i know marianne s heart  i know that she dearly loves me 
and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made
known 
when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible 
i would not attempt to force the confidence of any one 
of a child much less  because a sense of duty would prevent
the denial which her wishes might direct  

elinor thought this generosity overstrained 
considering her sister s youth  and urged the matter farther 
but in vain  common sense  common care  common prudence 
were all sunk in mrs  dashwood s romantic delicacy 

it was several days before willoughby s name
was mentioned before marianne by any of her family 
sir john and mrs  jennings  indeed  were not so nice 
their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour   
but one evening  mrs  dashwood  accidentally taking up a
volume of shakespeare  exclaimed 

 we have never finished hamlet  marianne  our dear
willoughby went away before we could get through it 
we will put it by  that when he comes again   but it may
be months  perhaps  before that happens  

 months   cried marianne  with strong surprise 
 no  nor many weeks  

mrs  dashwood was sorry for what she had said 
but it gave elinor pleasure  as it produced a reply
from marianne so expressive of confidence in willoughby
and knowledge of his intentions 

one morning  about a week after his leaving the country 
marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their
usual walk  instead of wandering away by herself 
hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in
her rambles   if her sisters intended to walk on the downs 
she directly stole away towards the lanes  if they talked
of the valley  she was as speedy in climbing the hills 
and could never be found when the others set off 
but at length she was secured by the exertions of elinor 
who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion   they walked
along the road through the valley  and chiefly in silence 
for marianne s mind could not be controlled  and elinor 
satisfied with gaining one point  would not then attempt more 
beyond the entrance of the valley  where the country 
though still rich  was less wild and more open  a long
stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming
to barton  lay before them  and on reaching that point 
they stopped to look around them  and examine a prospect
which formed the distance of their view from the cottage 
from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any
of their walks before 

amongst the objects in the scene  they soon discovered
an animated one  it was a man on horseback riding towards them 
in a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman 
and in a moment afterwards marianne rapturously exclaimed 

 it is he  it is indeed   i know it is    and was
hastening to meet him  when elinor cried out 

 indeed  marianne  i think you are mistaken   it is
not willoughby   the person is not tall enough for him 
and has not his air  

 he has  he has   cried marianne   i am sure he has 
his air  his coat  his horse   i knew how soon he would come  

she walked eagerly on as she spoke  and elinor 
to screen marianne from particularity  as she felt almost
certain of its not being willoughby  quickened her
pace and kept up with her   they were soon within
thirty yards of the gentleman   marianne looked again 
her heart sunk within her  and abruptly turning round 
she was hurrying back  when the voices of both her sisters
were raised to detain her  a third  almost as well known
as willoughby s  joined them in begging her to stop 
and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome
edward ferrars 

he was the only person in the world who could
at that moment be forgiven for not being willoughby 
the only one who could have gained a smile from her 
but she dispersed her tears to smile on him  and in her
sister s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment 

he dismounted  and giving his horse to his servant 
walked back with them to barton  whither he was purposely
coming to visit them 

he was welcomed by them all with great cordiality 
but especially by marianne  who showed more warmth of
regard in her reception of him than even elinor herself 
to marianne  indeed  the meeting between edward and her sister
was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she
had often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour 
on edward s side  more particularly  there was a deficiency
of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion 
he was confused  seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure
in seeing them  looked neither rapturous nor gay 
said little but what was forced from him by questions 
and distinguished elinor by no mark of affection 
marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise 
she began almost to feel a dislike of edward  and it ended 
as every feeling must end with her  by carrying back her
thoughts to willoughby  whose manners formed a contrast
sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect 

after a short silence which succeeded the first
surprise and enquiries of meeting  marianne asked
edward if he came directly from london   no  he had
been in devonshire a fortnight 

 a fortnight   she repeated  surprised at his being
so long in the same county with elinor without seeing
her before 

he looked rather distressed as he added  that he
had been staying with some friends near plymouth 

 have you been lately in sussex   said elinor 

 i was at norland about a month ago  

 and how does dear  dear norland look   cried marianne 

 dear  dear norland   said elinor   probably looks
much as it always does at this time of the year 
the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves  

 oh   cried marianne   with what transporting sensation
have i formerly seen them fall   how have i delighted 
as i walked  to see them driven in showers about me
by the wind   what feelings have they  the season  the air
altogether inspired   now there is no one to regard them 
they are seen only as a nuisance  swept hastily off 
and driven as much as possible from the sight  

 it is not every one   said elinor   who has your
passion for dead leaves  

 no  my feelings are not often shared  not often
understood   but sometimes they are    as she said this 
she sunk into a reverie for a few moments   but rousing
herself again   now  edward   said she  calling his attention
to the prospect   here is barton valley   look up to it 
and be tranquil if you can   look at those hills 
did you ever see their equals   to the left is barton park 
amongst those woods and plantations   you may see the end
of the house   and there  beneath that farthest hill 
which rises with such grandeur  is our cottage  

 it is a beautiful country   he replied   but these
bottoms must be dirty in winter  

 how can you think of dirt  with such objects before you  

 because   replied he  smiling   among the rest of the
objects before me  i see a very dirty lane  

 how strange   said marianne to herself as she walked on 

 have you an agreeable neighbourhood here   are the
middletons pleasant people  

 no  not all   answered marianne   we could not
be more unfortunately situated  

 marianne   cried her sister   how can you say so  how can
you be so unjust   they are a very respectable family  mr 
ferrars 
and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner   have you
forgot  marianne  how many pleasant days we have owed to them  

 no   said marianne  in a low voice   nor how many
painful moments  

elinor took no notice of this  and directing
her attention to their visitor  endeavoured to support
something like discourse with him  by talking of their
present residence  its conveniences   c  extorting from him
occasional questions and remarks   his coldness and reserve
mortified her severely  she was vexed and half angry 
but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past
rather than the present  she avoided every appearance
of resentment or displeasure  and treated him as she
thought he ought to be treated from the family connection 



chapter 17


mrs  dashwood was surprised only for a moment at
seeing him  for his coming to barton was  in her opinion 
of all things the most natural   her joy and expression
of regard long outlived her wonder   he received the kindest
welcome from her  and shyness  coldness  reserve could not
stand against such a reception   they had begun to fail him
before he entered the house  and they were quite overcome
by the captivating manners of mrs  dashwood   indeed a man
could not very well be in love with either of her daughters 
without extending the passion to her  and elinor had the
satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself 
his affections seemed to reanimate towards them all 
and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible 
he was not in spirits  however  he praised their house 
admired its prospect  was attentive  and kind  but still
he was not in spirits   the whole family perceived it 
and mrs  dashwood  attributing it to some want of liberality
in his mother  sat down to table indignant against all
selfish parents 

 what are mrs  ferrars s views for you at present  edward  
said she  when dinner was over and they had drawn round
the fire   are you still to be a great orator in spite of
yourself  

 no  i hope my mother is now convinced that i have
no more talents than inclination for a public life  

 but how is your fame to be established  for famous you
must be to satisfy all your family  and with no inclination
for expense  no affection for strangers  no profession 
and no assurance  you may find it a difficult matter  

 i shall not attempt it   i have no wish to be
distinguished  and have every reason to hope i never shall 
thank heaven  i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence  

 you have no ambition  i well know   your wishes
are all moderate  

 as moderate as those of the rest of the world 
i believe   i wish as well as every body else to be
perfectly happy  but  like every body else it must be
in my own way   greatness will not make me so  

 strange that it would   cried marianne    what have
wealth or grandeur to do with happiness  

 grandeur has but little   said elinor   but wealth
has much to do with it  

 elinor  for shame   said marianne   money can only
give happiness where there is nothing else to give it 
beyond a competence  it can afford no real satisfaction 
as far as mere self is concerned  

 perhaps   said elinor  smiling   we may come
to the same point   your competence and my wealth
are very much alike  i dare say  and without them 
as the world goes now  we shall both agree that every
kind of external comfort must be wanting   your ideas
are only more noble than mine   come  what is your competence  

 about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year 
not more than that  

elinor laughed    two thousand a year  one is my
wealth  i guessed how it would end  

 and yet two thousand a year is a very moderate income  
said marianne    a family cannot well be maintained on
a smaller   i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands 
a proper establishment of servants  a carriage  perhaps two 
and hunters  cannot be supported on less  

elinor smiled again  to hear her sister describing
so accurately their future expenses at combe magna 

 hunters   repeated edward   but why must you have
hunters   every body does not hunt  

marianne coloured as she replied   but most people do  

 i wish   said margaret  striking out a novel thought 
 that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece  

 oh that they would   cried marianne  her eyes
sparkling with animation  and her cheeks glowing
with the delight of such imaginary happiness 

 we are all unanimous in that wish  i suppose  
said elinor   in spite of the insufficiency of wealth  

 oh dear   cried margaret   how happy i should be 
i wonder what i should do with it  

marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point 

 i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself  
said mrs  dashwood   if my children were all to be rich
my help  

 you must begin your improvements on this house  
observed elinor   and your difficulties will soon vanish  

 what magnificent orders would travel from this family
to london   said edward   in such an event   what a happy
day for booksellers  music sellers  and print shops   you 
miss dashwood  would give a general commission for every
new print of merit to be sent you  and as for marianne 
i know her greatness of soul  there would not be music enough
in london to content her   and books   thomson  cowper 
scott  she would buy them all over and over again  she
would buy up every copy  i believe  to prevent their
falling into unworthy hands  and she would have every
book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree 
should not you  marianne   forgive me  if i am very saucy 
but i was willing to shew you that i had not forgot our
old disputes  

 i love to be reminded of the past  edward  whether it
be melancholy or gay  i love to recall it  and you
will never offend me by talking of former times 
you are very right in supposing how my money would be
spent  some of it  at least  my loose cash would certainly
be employed in improving my collection of music and books  

 and the bulk of your fortune would be laid out
in annuities on the authors or their heirs  

 no  edward  i should have something else to do
with it  

 perhaps  then  you would bestow it as a reward on that
person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim 
that no one can ever be in love more than once in their
life  your opinion on that point is unchanged  i presume  

 undoubtedly  at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed 
it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to
change them  

 marianne is as steadfast as ever  you see   said elinor 
 she is not at all altered  

 she is only grown a little more grave than she was  

 nay  edward   said marianne   you need not reproach me 
you are not very gay yourself  

 why should you think so   replied he  with a sigh 
 but gaiety never was a part of my character  

 nor do i think it a part of marianne s   said elinor 
 i should hardly call her a lively girl  she is very earnest 
very eager in all she does  sometimes talks a great deal
and always with animation  but she is not often really merry  

 i believe you are right   he replied   and yet i
have always set her down as a lively girl  

 i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes  
said elinor   in a total misapprehension of character in some
point or other  fancying people so much more gay or grave 
or ingenious or stupid than they really are  and i can
hardly tell why or in what the deception originated 
sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves 
and very frequently by what other people say of them 
without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge  

 but i thought it was right  elinor   said marianne 
 to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people 
i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient
to those of neighbours   this has always been your doctrine 
i am sure  

 no  marianne  never   my doctrine has never aimed
at the subjection of the understanding   all i have
ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour 
you must not confound my meaning   i am guilty  i confess 
of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance
in general with greater attention  but when have i advised
you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their
judgment in serious matters  

 you have not been able to bring your sister over to your
plan of general civility   said edward to elinor   do you gain
no ground  

 quite the contrary   replied elinor 
looking expressively at marianne 

 my judgment   he returned   is all on your side
of the question  but i am afraid my practice is much
more on your sister s   i never wish to offend  but i
am so foolishly shy  that i often seem negligent 
when i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness 
i have frequently thought that i must have been intended
by nature to be fond of low company  i am so little at
my ease among strangers of gentility  

 marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention
of hers   said elinor 

 she knows her own worth too well for false shame  
replied edward    shyness is only the effect of a sense
of inferiority in some way or other   if i could persuade
myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful 
i should not be shy  

 but you would still be reserved   said marianne 
 and that is worse  

edward started   reserved  am i reserved  marianne  

 yes  very  

 i do not understand you   replied he  colouring 
 reserved   how  in what manner   what am i to tell you 
what can you suppose  

elinor looked surprised at his emotion  but trying
to laugh off the subject  she said to him   do not you
know my sister well enough to understand what she means 
do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not
talk as fast  and admire what she admires as rapturously
as herself  

edward made no answer   his gravity and thoughtfulness
returned on him in their fullest extent  and he sat
for some time silent and dull 



chapter 18


elinor saw  with great uneasiness the low spirits
of her friend   his visit afforded her but a very
partial satisfaction  while his own enjoyment in it
appeared so imperfect   it was evident that he was unhappy 
she wished it were equally evident that he still
distinguished her by the same affection which once
she had felt no doubt of inspiring  but hitherto the
continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain 
and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted
one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding
one 

he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room
the next morning before the others were down  and marianne 
who was always eager to promote their happiness as far
as she could  soon left them to themselves   but before she
was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open  and 
turning round  was astonished to see edward himself come out 

 i am going into the village to see my horses  
said be   as you are not yet ready for breakfast  i shall
be back again presently  

                       

edward returned to them with fresh admiration
of the surrounding country  in his walk to the village 
he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage 
and the village itself  in a much higher situation than
the cottage  afforded a general view of the whole  which had
exceedingly pleased him   this was a subject which ensured
marianne s attention  and she was beginning to describe
her own admiration of these scenes  and to question him more
minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him 
when edward interrupted her by saying   you must not
enquire too far  marianne  remember i have no knowledge
in the picturesque  and i shall offend you by my ignorance
and want of taste if we come to particulars   i shall call
hills steep  which ought to be bold  surfaces strange
and uncouth  which ought to be irregular and rugged 
and distant objects out of sight  which ought only to be
indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere 
you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can
honestly give   i call it a very fine country  the
hills are steep  the woods seem full of fine timber 
and the valley looks comfortable and snug  with rich
meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here
and there   it exactly answers my idea of a fine country 
because it unites beauty with utility  and i dare say it
is a picturesque one too  because you admire it  i can
easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories 
grey moss and brush wood  but these are all lost on me 
i know nothing of the picturesque  

 i am afraid it is but too true   said marianne 
 but why should you boast of it  

 i suspect   said elinor   that to avoid one kind
of affectation  edward here falls into another   because he
believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties
of nature than they really feel  and is disgusted with
such pretensions  he affects greater indifference and less
discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses 
he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own  

 it is very true   said marianne   that admiration
of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon 
every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with
the taste and elegance of him who first defined what
picturesque beauty was   i detest jargon of every kind 
and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself 
because i could find no language to describe them
in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning  

 i am convinced   said edward   that you really feel
all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess
to feel   but  in return  your sister must allow me
to feel no more than i profess   i like a fine prospect 
but not on picturesque principles   i do not like crooked 
twisted  blasted trees   i admire them much more if they
are tall  straight  and flourishing   i do not like ruined 
tattered cottages   i am not fond of nettles or thistles 
or heath blossoms   i have more pleasure in a snug
farm house than a watch tower  and a troop of tidy 
happy villages please me better than the finest banditti
in the world  

marianne looked with amazement at edward 
with compassion at her sister   elinor only laughed 

the subject was continued no farther  and marianne
remained thoughtfully silent  till a new object suddenly
engaged her attention   she was sitting by edward  and
in taking his tea from mrs  dashwood  his hand passed
so directly before her  as to make a ring  with a plait
of hair in the centre  very conspicuous on one of his fingers 

 i never saw you wear a ring before  edward   she cried 
 is that fanny s hair  i remember her promising to give
you some   but i should have thought her hair had been darker  

marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt  
but when she saw how much she had pained edward  her own
vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed
by his   he coloured very deeply  and giving a momentary
glance at elinor  replied   yes  it is my sister s hair 
the setting always casts a different shade on it 
you know  

elinor had met his eye  and looked conscious likewise 
that the hair was her own  she instantaneously felt as
well satisfied as marianne  the only difference in their
conclusions was  that what marianne considered as a free
gift from her sister  elinor was conscious must have been
procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself 
she was not in a humour  however  to regard it as an affront 
and affecting to take no notice of what passed 
by instantly talking of something else  she internally
resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing
the hair and of satisfying herself  beyond all doubt 
that it was exactly the shade of her own 

edward s embarrassment lasted some time  and it
ended in an absence of mind still more settled 
he was particularly grave the whole morning 
marianne severely censured herself for what she had said 
but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy 
had she known how little offence it had given her sister 

before the middle of the day  they were visited by sir
john and mrs  jennings  who  having heard of the arrival
of a gentleman at the cottage  came to take a survey
of the guest   with the assistance of his mother in law 
sir john was not long in discovering that the name of
ferrars began with an f  and this prepared a future mine
of raillery against the devoted elinor  which nothing but
the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have
prevented from being immediately sprung   but  as it was 
she only learned  from some very significant looks  how far
their penetration  founded on margaret s instructions  extended 

sir john never came to the dashwoods without either
inviting them to dine at the park the next day  or to drink
tea with them that evening   on the present occasion 
for the better entertainment of their visitor  towards
whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute 
he wished to engage them for both 

 you must drink tea with us to night   said he 
 for we shall be quite alone  and tomorrow you must
absolutely dine with us  for we shall be a large party  

mrs  jennings enforced the necessity    and who knows
but you may raise a dance   said she    and that will
tempt you  miss marianne  

 a dance   cried marianne    impossible  who is to dance  

 who  why yourselves  and the careys  and whitakers
to be sure   what  you thought nobody could dance
because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone  

 i wish with all my soul   cried sir john 
 that willoughby were among us again  

this  and marianne s blushing  gave new suspicions
to edward    and who is willoughby   said he  in a low voice 
to miss dashwood  by whom he was sitting 

she gave him a brief reply   marianne s countenance
was more communicative   edward saw enough to comprehend 
not only the meaning of others  but such of marianne s
expressions as had puzzled him before  and when their
visitors left them  he went immediately round her  and said 
in a whisper   i have been guessing   shall i tell you
my guess  

 what do you mean  

 shall i tell you  

 certainly  

 well then  i guess that mr  willoughby hunts  

marianne was surprised and confused  yet she could
not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner 
and after a moment s silence  said 

 oh  edward  how can you   but the time will come
i hope   i am sure you will like him  

 i do not doubt it   replied he  rather astonished
at her earnestness and warmth  for had he not imagined it
to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general 
founded only on a something or a nothing between mr  willoughby
and herself  he would not have ventured to mention it 



chapter 19


edward remained a week at the cottage  he was earnestly
pressed by mrs  dashwood to stay longer  but  as if he
were bent only on self mortification  he seemed resolved
to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at
the height   his spirits  during the last two or three days 
though still very unequal  were greatly improved  he grew
more and more partial to the house and environs  never
spoke of going away without a sigh  declared his time
to be wholly disengaged  even doubted to what place he
should go when he left them  but still  go he must 
never had any week passed so quickly  he could hardly
believe it to be gone   he said so repeatedly  other things
he said too  which marked the turn of his feelings and gave
the lie to his actions   he had no pleasure at norland 
he detested being in town  but either to norland or london 
he must go   he valued their kindness beyond any thing 
and his greatest happiness was in being with them 
yet  he must leave them at the end of a week  in spite
of their wishes and his own  and without any restraint
on his time 

elinor placed all that was astonishing in this
way of acting to his mother s account  and it was
happy for her that he had a mother whose character
was so imperfectly known to her  as to be the general
excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son 
disappointed  however  and vexed as she was  and sometimes
displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself 
she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions
with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications 
which had been rather more painfully extorted from her 
for willoughby s service  by her mother   his want of spirits 
of openness  and of consistency  were most usually
attributed to his want of independence  and his better
knowledge of mrs  ferrars s disposition and designs 
the shortness of his visit  the steadiness of his purpose
in leaving them  originated in the same fettered inclination 
the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother 
the old well established grievance of duty against will 
parent against child  was the cause of all   she would have
been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease 
this opposition was to yield   when mrs  ferrars would
be reformed  and her son be at liberty to be happy 
but from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort
to the renewal of her confidence in edward s affection 
to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word
which fell from him while at barton  and above all
to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore
round his finger 

 i think  edward   said mrs  dashwood  as they were
at breakfast the last morning   you would be a happier man
if you had any profession to engage your time and give
an interest to your plans and actions   some inconvenience
to your friends  indeed  might result from it  you
would not be able to give them so much of your time 
but  with a smile  you would be materially benefited
in one particular at least  you would know where to go
when you left them  

 i do assure you   he replied   that i have long
thought on this point  as you think now   it has been 
and is  and probably will always be a heavy misfortune
to me  that i have had no necessary business to engage me 
no profession to give me employment  or afford me any
thing like independence   but unfortunately my own nicety 
and the nicety of my friends  have made me what i am 
an idle  helpless being   we never could agree in our
choice of a profession   i always preferred the church 
as i still do   but that was not smart enough for my family 
they recommended the army   that was a great deal
too smart for me   the law was allowed to be genteel
enough  many young men  who had chambers in the temple 
made a very good appearance in the first circles 
and drove about town in very knowing gigs   but i had
no inclination for the law  even in this less abstruse
study of it  which my family approved   as for the navy 
it had fashion on its side  but i was too old when the
subject was first started to enter it  and  at length 
as there was no necessity for my having any profession
at all  as i might be as dashing and expensive without
a red coat on my back as with one  idleness was pronounced
on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable 
and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly
bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his
friends to do nothing   i was therefore entered at oxford
and have been properly idle ever since  

 the consequence of which  i suppose  will be  
said mrs  dashwood   since leisure has not promoted
your own happiness  that your sons will be brought up
to as many pursuits  employments  professions  and trades
as columella s  

 they will be brought up   said he  in a serious accent 
 to be as unlike myself as is possible   in feeling 
in action  in condition  in every thing  

 come  come  this is all an effusion of immediate
want of spirits  edward   you are in a melancholy humour 
and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy 
but remember that the pain of parting from friends
will be felt by every body at times  whatever be their
education or state   know your own happiness   you want
nothing but patience  or give it a more fascinating name 
call it hope   your mother will secure to you  in time 
that independence you are so anxious for  it is her duty 
and it will  it must ere long become her happiness to
prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent 
how much may not a few months do  

 i think   replied edward   that i may defy many
months to produce any good to me  

this desponding turn of mind  though it could not
be communicated to mrs  dashwood  gave additional pain
to them all in the parting  which shortly took place 
and left an uncomfortable impression on elinor s
feelings especially  which required some trouble and time
to subdue   but as it was her determination to subdue it 
and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than
what all her family suffered on his going away  she did
not adopt the method so judiciously employed by marianne 
on a similar occasion  to augment and fix her sorrow 
by seeking silence  solitude and idleness   their means
were as different as their objects  and equally suited
to the advancement of each 

elinor sat down to her drawing table as soon as he
was out of the house  busily employed herself the whole day 
neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name 
appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the
general concerns of the family  and if  by this conduct 
she did not lessen her own grief  it was at least prevented
from unnecessary increase  and her mother and sisters
were spared much solicitude on her account 

such behaviour as this  so exactly the reverse
of her own  appeared no more meritorious to marianne 
than her own had seemed faulty to her   the business
of self command she settled very easily   with strong
affections it was impossible  with calm ones it could
have no merit   that her sister s affections were calm 
she dared not deny  though she blushed to acknowledge it 
and of the strength of her own  she gave a very striking proof 
by still loving and respecting that sister  in spite
of this mortifying conviction 

without shutting herself up from her family 
or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them 
or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation 
elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough
to think of edward  and of edward s behaviour  in every
possible variety which the different state of her spirits
at different times could produce   with tenderness 
pity  approbation  censure  and doubt   there were moments
in abundance  when  if not by the absence of her mother
and sisters  at least by the nature of their employments 
conversation was forbidden among them  and every effect
of solitude was produced   her mind was inevitably
at liberty  her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere 
and the past and the future  on a subject so interesting 
must be before her  must force her attention  and engross
her memory  her reflection  and her fancy 

from a reverie of this kind  as she sat at her
drawing table  she was roused one morning  soon after
edward s leaving them  by the arrival of company 
she happened to be quite alone   the closing of the
little gate  at the entrance of the green court in front
of the house  drew her eyes to the window  and she saw
a large party walking up to the door   amongst them
were sir john and lady middleton and mrs  jennings 
but there were two others  a gentleman and lady  who were
quite unknown to her   she was sitting near the window 
and as soon as sir john perceived her  he left the rest
of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door 
and stepping across the turf  obliged her to open the
casement to speak to him  though the space was so short
between the door and the window  as to make it hardly
possible to speak at one without being heard at the other 

 well   said he   we have brought you some strangers 
how do you like them  

 hush  they will hear you  

 never mind if they do   it is only the palmers 
charlotte is very pretty  i can tell you   you may see her
if you look this way  

as elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple
of minutes  without taking that liberty  she begged
to be excused 

 where is marianne  has she run away because we
are come  i see her instrument is open  

 she is walking  i believe  

they were now joined by mrs  jennings  who had not
patience enough to wait till the door was opened before
she told her story   she came hallooing to the window 
 how do you do  my dear   how does mrs  dashwood do 
and where are your sisters   what  all alone  you
will be glad of a little company to sit with you 
i have brought my other son and daughter to see you 
only think of their coming so suddenly   i thought i heard
a carriage last night  while we were drinking our tea 
but it never entered my head that it could be them 
i thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel
brandon come back again  so i said to sir john  i do think
i hear a carriage  perhaps it is colonel brandon come
back again   

elinor was obliged to turn from her  in the middle
of her story  to receive the rest of the party  lady
middleton introduced the two strangers  mrs  dashwood
and margaret came down stairs at the same time  and they
all sat down to look at one another  while mrs  jennings
continued her story as she walked through the passage
into the parlour  attended by sir john 

mrs  palmer was several years younger than lady
middleton  and totally unlike her in every respect 
she was short and plump  had a very pretty face 
and the finest expression of good humour in it that could
possibly be   her manners were by no means so elegant
as her sister s  but they were much more prepossessing 
she came in with a smile  smiled all the time of her visit 
except when she laughed  and smiled when she went away 
her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six
and twenty  with an air of more fashion and sense than
his wife  but of less willingness to please or be pleased 
he entered the room with a look of self consequence 
slightly bowed to the ladies  without speaking a word 
and  after briefly surveying them and their apartments 
took up a newspaper from the table  and continued to read it
as long as he staid 

mrs  palmer  on the contrary  who was strongly endowed
by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy 
was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour
and every thing in it burst forth 

 well  what a delightful room this is  i never
saw anything so charming   only think  mamma  how it
is improved since i was here last  i always thought it
such a sweet place  ma am   turning to mrs  dashwood 
but you have made it so charming   only look  sister 
how delightful every thing is  how i should like such
a house for myself   should not you  mr  palmer  

mr  palmer made her no answer  and did not even raise
his eyes from the newspaper 

 mr  palmer does not hear me   said she  laughing 
 he never does sometimes   it is so ridiculous  

this was quite a new idea to mrs  dashwood  she had
never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one 
and could not help looking with surprise at them both 

mrs  jennings  in the meantime  talked on as loud
as she could  and continued her account of their surprise 
the evening before  on seeing their friends  without
ceasing till every thing was told   mrs  palmer laughed
heartily at the recollection of their astonishment 
and every body agreed  two or three times over  that it
had been quite an agreeable surprise 

 you may believe how glad we all were to see them  
added mrs  jennings  leaning forward towards elinor 
and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard
by no one else  though they were seated on different sides
of the room   but  however  i can t help wishing they had
not travelled quite so fast  nor made such a long journey
of it  for they came all round by london upon account
of some business  for you know  nodding significantly and
pointing to her daughter  it was wrong in her situation 
i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning 
but she would come with us  she longed so much to see
you all  

mrs  palmer laughed  and said it would not do her
any harm 

 she expects to be confined in february  
continued mrs  jennings 

lady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation 
and therefore exerted herself to ask mr  palmer if there
was any news in the paper 

 no  none at all   he replied  and read on 

 here comes marianne   cried sir john    now  palmer 
you shall see a monstrous pretty girl  

he immediately went into the passage  opened the front door 
and ushered her in himself   mrs  jennings asked her 
as soon as she appeared  if she had not been to allenham 
and mrs  palmer laughed so heartily at the question 
as to show she understood it   mr  palmer looked up
on her entering the room  stared at her some minutes 
and then returned to his newspaper   mrs  palmer s eye
was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room 
she got up to examine them 

 oh  dear  how beautiful these are   well  how delightful 
do but look  mama  how sweet  i declare they are quite charming 
i could look at them for ever   and then sitting down again 
she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room 

when lady middleton rose to go away  mr  palmer
rose also  laid down the newspaper  stretched himself
and looked at them all around 

 my love  have you been asleep   said his wife  laughing 

he made her no answer  and only observed  after again
examining the room  that it was very low pitched 
and that the ceiling was crooked   he then made his bow 
and departed with the rest 

sir john had been very urgent with them all to
spend the next day at the park   mrs  dashwood  who did
not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined
at the cottage  absolutely refused on her own account 
her daughters might do as they pleased   but they had no
curiosity to see how mr  and mrs  palmer ate their dinner 
and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way 
they attempted  therefore  likewise  to excuse themselves 
the weather was uncertain  and not likely to be good 
but sir john would not be satisfied  the carriage should
be sent for them and they must come   lady middleton too 
though she did not press their mother  pressed them 
mrs  jennings and mrs  palmer joined their entreaties  all
seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party  and the young
ladies were obliged to yield 

 why should they ask us   said marianne  as soon as they
were gone    the rent of this cottage is said to be low 
but we have it on very hard terms  if we are to dine
at the park whenever any one is staying either with them 
or with us  

 they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now  
said elinor   by these frequent invitations  than by
those which we received from them a few weeks ago 
the alteration is not in them  if their parties are grown
tedious and dull   we must look for the change elsewhere  



chapter 20


as the miss dashwoods entered the drawing room of the park
the next day  at one door  mrs  palmer came running in at
the other  looking as good humoured and merry as before 
she took them all most affectionately by the hand 
and expressed great delight in seeing them again 

 i am so glad to see you   said she  seating herself
between elinor and marianne   for it is so bad a day i was
afraid you might not come  which would be a shocking thing 
as we go away again tomorrow  we must go  for the westons
come to us next week you know   it was quite a sudden thing
our coming at all  and i knew nothing of it till the carriage
was coming to the door  and then mr  palmer asked me if i
would go with him to barton   he is so droll  he never
tells me any thing  i am so sorry we cannot stay longer 
however we shall meet again in town very soon  i hope  

they were obliged to put an end to such an expectation 

 not go to town   cried mrs  palmer  with a laugh 
 i shall be quite disappointed if you do not   i could
get the nicest house in world for you  next door to ours 
in hanover square   you must come  indeed   i am sure
i shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till
i am confined  if mrs  dashwood should not like to go
into public  

they thanked her  but were obliged to resist all
her entreaties 

 oh  my love   cried mrs  palmer to her husband 
who just then entered the room   you must help me to
persuade the miss dashwoods to go to town this winter  

her love made no answer  and after slightly bowing
to the ladies  began complaining of the weather 

 how horrid all this is   said he    such weather
makes every thing and every body disgusting   dullness
is as much produced within doors as without  by rain 
it makes one detest all one s acquaintance   what the
devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room
in his house   how few people know what comfort is   sir
john is as stupid as the weather  

the rest of the company soon dropt in 

 i am afraid  miss marianne   said sir john   you have
not been able to take your usual walk to allenham today  

marianne looked very grave and said nothing 

 oh  don t be so sly before us   said mrs  palmer 
 for we know all about it  i assure you  and i admire your
taste very much  for i think he is extremely handsome 
we do not live a great way from him in the country  you know 
not above ten miles  i dare say  

 much nearer thirty   said her husband 

 ah  well  there is not much difference 
i never was at his house  but they say it is a sweet
pretty place  

 as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life  
said mr  palmer 

marianne remained perfectly silent  though her
countenance betrayed her interest in what was said 

 is it very ugly   continued mrs  palmer   then it
must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose  

when they were seated in the dining room  sir john
observed with regret that they were only eight all together 

 my dear   said he to his lady   it is very provoking
that we should be so few   why did not you ask the gilberts
to come to us today  

 did not i tell you  sir john  when you spoke to me
about it before  that it could not be done   they dined
with us last  

 you and i  sir john   said mrs  jennings 
 should not stand upon such ceremony  

 then you would be very ill bred   cried mr  palmer 

 my love you contradict every body   said his wife
with her usual laugh    do you know that you are quite rude  

 i did not know i contradicted any body in calling
your mother ill bred  

 ay  you may abuse me as you please   said the good natured
old lady   you have taken charlotte off my hands  and cannot
give her back again   so there i have the whip hand of you  

charlotte laughed heartily to think that her
husband could not get rid of her  and exultingly said 
she did not care how cross he was to her  as they must
live together   it was impossible for any one to be more
thoroughly good natured  or more determined to be happy
than mrs  palmer   the studied indifference  insolence 
and discontent of her husband gave her no pain 
and when he scolded or abused her  she was highly diverted 

 mr  palmer is so droll   said she  in a whisper 
to elinor    he is always out of humour  

elinor was not inclined  after a little observation 
to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly
ill natured or ill bred as he wished to appear 
his temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding 
like many others of his sex  that through some unaccountable
bias in favour of beauty  he was the husband of a very silly
woman   but she knew that this kind of blunder was too
common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it   
it was rather a wish of distinction  she believed 
which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body 
and his general abuse of every thing before him 
it was the desire of appearing superior to other people 
the motive was too common to be wondered at  but the means 
however they might succeed by establishing his superiority
in ill breeding  were not likely to attach any one to him
except his wife 

 oh  my dear miss dashwood   said mrs  palmer soon afterwards 
 i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister 
will you come and spend some time at cleveland this
christmas   now  pray do   and come while the westons are
with us   you cannot think how happy i shall be   it will
be quite delightful   my love   applying to her husband 
 don t you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland  

 certainly   he replied  with a sneer   i came
into devonshire with no other view  

 there now    said his lady   you see mr  palmer
expects you  so you cannot refuse to come  

they both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation 

 but indeed you must and shall come   i am sure you
will like it of all things   the westons will be with us 
and it will be quite delightful   you cannot think
what a sweet place cleveland is  and we are so gay now 
for mr  palmer is always going about the country canvassing
against the election  and so many people came to dine
with us that i never saw before  it is quite charming   but 
poor fellow  it is very fatiguing to him  for he is forced
to make every body like him  

elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she
assented to the hardship of such an obligation 

 how charming it will be   said charlotte   when he
is in parliament   won t it  how i shall laugh   it will
be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him
with an m p   but do you know  he says  he will never frank
for me   he declares he won t   don t you  mr  palmer  

mr  palmer took no notice of her 

 he cannot bear writing  you know   she continued  
 he says it is quite shocking  

 no   said he   i never said any thing so irrational 
don t palm all your abuses of languages upon me  

 there now  you see how droll he is   this is always
the way with him   sometimes he won t speak to me for half
a day together  and then he comes out with something
so droll  all about any thing in the world  

she surprised elinor very much as they returned
into the drawing room  by asking her whether she did
not like mr  palmer excessively 

 certainly   said elinor   he seems very agreeable  

 well  i am so glad you do   i thought you would 
he is so pleasant  and mr  palmer is excessively pleased
with you and your sisters i can tell you  and you can t
think how disappointed he will be if you don t come
to cleveland   i can t imagine why you should object
to it  

elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation 
and by changing the subject  put a stop to her entreaties 
she thought it probable that as they lived in the
same county  mrs  palmer might be able to give some
more particular account of willoughby s general
character  than could be gathered from the middletons 
partial acquaintance with him  and she was eager to gain
from any one  such a confirmation of his merits as might
remove the possibility of fear from marianne   she began
by inquiring if they saw much of mr  willoughby at cleveland 
and whether they were intimately acquainted with him 

 oh dear  yes  i know him extremely well  
replied mrs  palmer    not that i ever spoke
to him  indeed  but i have seen him for ever in town 
somehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton
while he was at allenham   mama saw him here once before   
but i was with my uncle at weymouth   however  i dare say
we should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire 
if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never
have been in the country together   he is very little
at combe  i believe  but if he were ever so much there 
i do not think mr  palmer would visit him  for he is
in the opposition  you know  and besides it is such a
way off   i know why you inquire about him  very well 
your sister is to marry him   i am monstrous glad of it 
for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know  

 upon my word   replied elinor   you know much
more of the matter than i do  if you have any reason
to expect such a match  

 don t pretend to deny it  because you know it is
what every body talks of   i assure you i heard of it
in my way through town  

 my dear mrs  palmer  

 upon my honour i did   i met colonel brandon
monday morning in bond street  just before we left town 
and he told me of it directly  

 you surprise me very much   colonel brandon tell
you of it   surely you must be mistaken   to give such
intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it 
even if it were true  is not what i should expect colonel
brandon to do  

 but i do assure you it was so  for all that 
and i will tell you how it happened   when we met him 
he turned back and walked with us  and so we began talking
of my brother and sister  and one thing and another 
and i said to him   so  colonel  there is a new family
come to barton cottage  i hear  and mama sends me word
they are very pretty  and that one of them is going to be
married to mr  willoughby of combe magna   is it true 
pray  for of course you must know  as you have been in
devonshire so lately   

 and what did the colonel say  

 oh  he did not say much  but he looked as if he
knew it to be true  so from that moment i set it down
as certain   it will be quite delightful  i declare 
when is it to take place  

 mr  brandon was very well i hope  

 oh  yes  quite well  and so full of your praises 
he did nothing but say fine things of you  

 i am flattered by his commendation   he seems
an excellent man  and i think him uncommonly pleasing  

 so do i   he is such a charming man  that it
is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull 
mamma says he was in love with your sister too   
i assure you it was a great compliment if he was  for he
hardly ever falls in love with any body  

 is mr  willoughby much known in your part
of somersetshire   said elinor 

 oh  yes  extremely well  that is  i do not believe
many people are acquainted with him  because combe magna
is so far off  but they all think him extremely agreeable
i assure you   nobody is more liked than mr  willoughby
wherever he goes  and so you may tell your sister 
she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him  upon my honour 
not but that he is much more lucky in getting her 
because she is so very handsome and agreeable  that nothing
can be good enough for her   however  i don t think
her hardly at all handsomer than you  i assure you 
for i think you both excessively pretty  and so does
mr  palmer too i am sure  though we could not get him
to own it last night  

mrs  palmer s information respecting willoughby
was not very material  but any testimony in his favour 
however small  was pleasing to her 

 i am so glad we are got acquainted at last  
continued charlotte    and now i hope we shall always be
great friends   you can t think how much i longed to see you 
it is so delightful that you should live at the cottage 
nothing can be like it  to be sure   and i am so glad
your sister is going to be well married   i hope you will
be a great deal at combe magna   it is a sweet place 
by all accounts  

 you have been long acquainted with colonel brandon 
have not you  

 yes  a great while  ever since my sister married   
he was a particular friend of sir john s  i believe  
she added in a low voice   he would have been very
glad to have had me  if he could   sir john and lady
middleton wished it very much   but mama did not think
the match good enough for me  otherwise sir john would
have mentioned it to the colonel  and we should have been
married immediately  

 did not colonel brandon know of sir john s proposal
to your mother before it was made   had he never owned
his affection to yourself  

 oh  no  but if mama had not objected to it 
i dare say he would have liked it of all things 
he had not seen me then above twice  for it was before
i left school   however  i am much happier as i am 
mr  palmer is the kind of man i like  



chapter 21


the palmers returned to cleveland the next day 
and the two families at barton were again left to entertain
each other   but this did not last long  elinor had hardly
got their last visitors out of her head  had hardly done
wondering at charlotte s being so happy without a cause 
at mr  palmer s acting so simply  with good abilities 
and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between
husband and wife  before sir john s and mrs  jennings s
active zeal in the cause of society  procured her some
other new acquaintance to see and observe 

in a morning s excursion to exeter  they had met with
two young ladies  whom mrs  jennings had the satisfaction
of discovering to be her relations  and this was enough
for sir john to invite them directly to the park 
as soon as their present engagements at exeter were over 
their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before
such an invitation  and lady middleton was thrown into
no little alarm on the return of sir john  by hearing
that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls
whom she had never seen in her life  and of whose elegance   
whose tolerable gentility even  she could have no proof 
for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject
went for nothing at all   their being her relations too
made it so much the worse  and mrs  jennings s attempts
at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded 
when she advised her daughter not to care about their being
so fashionable  because they were all cousins and must put
up with one another   as it was impossible  however  now to
prevent their coming  lady middleton resigned herself to the
idea of it  with all the philosophy of a well bred woman 
contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle
reprimand on the subject five or six times every day 

the young ladies arrived  their appearance was by
no means ungenteel or unfashionable   their dress was
very smart  their manners very civil  they were delighted
with the house  and in raptures with the furniture 
and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children
that lady middleton s good opinion was engaged in their
favour before they had been an hour at the park 
she declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed 
which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration 
sir john s confidence in his own judgment rose with this
animated praise  and he set off directly for the cottage
to tell the miss dashwoods of the miss steeles  arrival 
and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls
in the world   from such commendation as this  however 
there was not much to be learned  elinor well knew
that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met
with in every part of england  under every possible
variation of form  face  temper and understanding 
sir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly
and look at his guests   benevolent  philanthropic man   it
was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself 

 do come now   said he   pray come  you must come  i
declare you shall come  you can t think how you will
like them   lucy is monstrous pretty  and so good humoured
and agreeable   the children are all hanging about her already 
as if she was an old acquaintance   and they both long
to see you of all things  for they have heard at exeter
that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world 
and i have told them it is all very true  and a great
deal more   you will be delighted with them i am sure 
they have brought the whole coach full of playthings
for the children   how can you be so cross as not to come 
why they are your cousins  you know  after a fashion 
you are my cousins  and they are my wife s  so you must
be related  

but sir john could not prevail   he could only obtain
a promise of their calling at the park within a day or two 
and then left them in amazement at their indifference 
to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the
miss steeles  as he had been already boasting of the miss
steeles to them 

when their promised visit to the park and consequent
introduction to these young ladies took place  they found
in the appearance of the eldest  who was nearly thirty 
with a very plain and not a sensible face  nothing to admire 
but in the other  who was not more than two or three
and twenty  they acknowledged considerable beauty  her
features were pretty  and she had a sharp quick eye 
and a smartness of air  which though it did not give
actual elegance or grace  gave distinction to her person   
their manners were particularly civil  and elinor soon
allowed them credit for some kind of sense  when she
saw with what constant and judicious attention they
were making themselves agreeable to lady middleton 
with her children they were in continual raptures 
extolling their beauty  courting their notice  and humouring
their whims  and such of their time as could be spared from
the importunate demands which this politeness made on it 
was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing 
if she happened to be doing any thing  or in taking patterns
of some elegant new dress  in which her appearance
the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight 
fortunately for those who pay their court through
such foibles  a fond mother  though  in pursuit of praise
for her children  the most rapacious of human beings 
is likewise the most credulous  her demands are exorbitant 
but she will swallow any thing  and the excessive
affection and endurance of the miss steeles towards
her offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton
without the smallest surprise or distrust   she saw with
maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments
and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted 
she saw their sashes untied  their hair pulled about
their ears  their work bags searched  and their knives
and scissors stolen away  and felt no doubt of its being
a reciprocal enjoyment   it suggested no other surprise
than that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by 
without claiming a share in what was passing 

 john is in such spirits today   said she  on his
taking miss steeles s pocket handkerchief  and throwing
it out of window   he is full of monkey tricks  

and soon afterwards  on the second boy s violently
pinching one of the same lady s fingers  she fondly observed 
 how playful william is  

 and here is my sweet little annamaria   she added 
tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old 
who had not made a noise for the last two minutes 
 and she is always so gentle and quiet  never was there
such a quiet little thing  

but unfortunately in bestowing these embraces 
a pin in her ladyship s head dress slightly scratching
the child s neck  produced from this pattern of gentleness
such violent screams  as could hardly be outdone by any
creature professedly noisy   the mother s consternation
was excessive  but it could not surpass the alarm of the
miss steeles  and every thing was done by all three 
in so critical an emergency  which affection could suggest
as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer 
she was seated in her mother s lap  covered with kisses 
her wound bathed with lavender water  by one of the
miss steeles  who was on her knees to attend her 
and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other 
with such a reward for her tears  the child was too wise
to cease crying   she still screamed and sobbed lustily 
kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her  and all
their united soothings were ineffectual till lady middleton
luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress
last week  some apricot marmalade had been successfully
applied for a bruised temple  the same remedy was eagerly
proposed for this unfortunate scratch  and a slight
intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it 
gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected   
she was carried out of the room therefore in her
mother s arms  in quest of this medicine  and as the
two boys chose to follow  though earnestly entreated
by their mother to stay behind  the four young ladies
were left in a quietness which the room had not known for
many hours 

 poor little creatures   said miss steele  as soon
as they were gone    it might have been a very sad accident  

 yet i hardly know how   cried marianne   unless it
had been under totally different circumstances 
but this is the usual way of heightening alarm  where there
is nothing to be alarmed at in reality  

 what a sweet woman lady middleton is   said lucy steele 

marianne was silent  it was impossible for her to say
what she did not feel  however trivial the occasion 
and upon elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies
when politeness required it  always fell   she did her
best when thus called on  by speaking of lady middleton
with more warmth than she felt  though with far less than
miss lucy 

 and sir john too   cried the elder sister 
 what a charming man he is  

here too  miss dashwood s commendation  being only
simple and just  came in without any eclat   she merely
observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly 

 and what a charming little family they have   i
never saw such fine children in my life   i declare i
quite doat upon them already  and indeed i am always
distractedly fond of children  

 i should guess so   said elinor  with a smile 
 from what i have witnessed this morning  

 i have a notion   said lucy   you think the little
middletons rather too much indulged  perhaps they may be the
outside of enough  but it is so natural in lady middleton 
and for my part  i love to see children full of life
and spirits  i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet  

 i confess   replied elinor   that while i am at
barton park  i never think of tame and quiet children
with any abhorrence  

a short pause succeeded this speech  which was first
broken by miss steele  who seemed very much disposed
for conversation  and who now said rather abruptly 
 and how do you like devonshire  miss dashwood   i suppose
you were very sorry to leave sussex  

in some surprise at the familiarity of this question 
or at least of the manner in which it was spoken 
elinor replied that she was 

 norland is a prodigious beautiful place  is not it  
added miss steele 

 we have heard sir john admire it excessively  
said lucy  who seemed to think some apology necessary
for the freedom of her sister 

 i think every one must admire it   replied elinor 
 who ever saw the place  though it is not to be supposed
that any one can estimate its beauties as we do  

 and had you a great many smart beaux there   i
suppose you have not so many in this part of the world 
for my part  i think they are a vast addition always  

 but why should you think   said lucy  looking ashamed
of her sister   that there are not as many genteel young
men in devonshire as sussex  

 nay  my dear  i m sure i don t pretend to say that there
an t   i m sure there s a vast many smart beaux in exeter 
but you know  how could i tell what smart beaux there
might be about norland  and i was only afraid the miss
dashwoods might find it dull at barton  if they had not
so many as they used to have   but perhaps you young ladies
may not care about the beaux  and had as lief be without
them as with them   for my part  i think they are vastly
agreeable  provided they dress smart and behave civil 
but i can t bear to see them dirty and nasty   now there s
mr  rose at exeter  a prodigious smart young man 
quite a beau  clerk to mr  simpson  you know  and yet if you
do but meet him of a morning  he is not fit to be seen   
i suppose your brother was quite a beau  miss dashwood 
before he married  as he was so rich  

 upon my word   replied elinor   i cannot tell you 
for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word 
but this i can say  that if he ever was a beau before
he married  he is one still for there is not the smallest
alteration in him  

 oh  dear  one never thinks of married men s being
beaux  they have something else to do  

 lord  anne   cried her sister   you can talk of
nothing but beaux   you will make miss dashwood believe you
think of nothing else   and then to turn the discourse 
she began admiring the house and the furniture 

this specimen of the miss steeles was enough 
the vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left
her no recommendation  and as elinor was not blinded
by the beauty  or the shrewd look of the youngest 
to her want of real elegance and artlessness  she left
the house without any wish of knowing them better 

not so the miss steeles   they came from exeter  well
provided with admiration for the use of sir john middleton 
his family  and all his relations  and no niggardly
proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins  whom they
declared to be the most beautiful  elegant  accomplished 
and agreeable girls they had ever beheld  and with whom
they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted   
and to be better acquainted therefore  elinor soon found
was their inevitable lot  for as sir john was entirely
on the side of the miss steeles  their party would be
too strong for opposition  and that kind of intimacy
must be submitted to  which consists of sitting an hour
or two together in the same room almost every day 
sir john could do no more  but he did not know that any
more was required  to be together was  in his opinion 
to be intimate  and while his continual schemes for their
meeting were effectual  he had not a doubt of their being
established friends 

to do him justice  he did every thing in his power
to promote their unreserve  by making the miss steeles
acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins 
situations in the most delicate particulars   and elinor
had not seen them more than twice  before the eldest of
them wished her joy on her sister s having been so lucky
as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she
came to barton 

  twill be a fine thing to have her married so young
to be sure   said she   and i hear he is quite a beau 
and prodigious handsome   and i hope you may have as good
luck yourself soon   but perhaps you may have a friend
in the corner already  

elinor could not suppose that sir john would be more
nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward 
than he had been with respect to marianne  indeed it was
rather his favourite joke of the two  as being somewhat
newer and more conjectural  and since edward s visit 
they had never dined together without his drinking to her
best affections with so much significancy and so many nods
and winks  as to excite general attention   the letter f  
had been likewise invariably brought forward  and found
productive of such countless jokes  that its character
as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long
established with elinor 

the miss steeles  as she expected  had now all the
benefit of these jokes  and in the eldest of them they
raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman
alluded to  which  though often impertinently expressed 
was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness
into the concerns of their family   but sir john did not
sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise 
for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name 
as miss steele had in hearing it 

 his name is ferrars   said he  in a very audible whisper 
 but pray do not tell it  for it s a great secret  

 ferrars   repeated miss steele   mr  ferrars is
the happy man  is he  what  your sister in law s brother 
miss dashwood  a very agreeable young man to be sure 
i know him very well  

 how can you say so  anne   cried lucy  who generally
made an amendment to all her sister s assertions 
 though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s  it
is rather too much to pretend to know him very well  

elinor heard all this with attention and surprise 
 and who was this uncle   where did he live   how came
they acquainted    she wished very much to have the subject
continued  though she did not chuse to join in it herself 
but nothing more of it was said  and for the first time
in her life  she thought mrs  jennings deficient either
in curiosity after petty information  or in a disposition
to communicate it   the manner in which miss steele had
spoken of edward  increased her curiosity  for it struck
her as being rather ill natured  and suggested the suspicion
of that lady s knowing  or fancying herself to know something
to his disadvantage   but her curiosity was unavailing 
for no farther notice was taken of mr  ferrars s name by
miss steele when alluded to  or even openly mentioned by sir
john 



chapter 22


marianne  who had never much toleration for any
thing like impertinence  vulgarity  inferiority of parts 
or even difference of taste from herself  was at
this time particularly ill disposed  from the state
of her spirits  to be pleased with the miss steeles 
or to encourage their advances  and to the invariable
coldness of her behaviour towards them  which checked every
endeavour at intimacy on their side  elinor principally
attributed that preference of herself which soon became
evident in the manners of both  but especially of lucy 
who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation 
or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy
and frank communication of her sentiments 

lucy was naturally clever  her remarks were often
just and amusing  and as a companion for half an hour
elinor frequently found her agreeable  but her powers
had received no aid from education  she was ignorant
and illiterate  and her deficiency of all mental improvement 
her want of information in the most common particulars 
could not be concealed from miss dashwood  in spite of her
constant endeavour to appear to advantage   elinor saw 
and pitied her for  the neglect of abilities which education
might have rendered so respectable  but she saw  with less
tenderness of feeling  the thorough want of delicacy 
of rectitude  and integrity of mind  which her attentions 
her assiduities  her flatteries at the park betrayed 
and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company
of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance 
whose want of instruction prevented their meeting
in conversation on terms of equality  and whose conduct
toward others made every shew of attention and deference
towards herself perfectly valueless 

 you will think my question an odd one  i dare say  
said lucy to her one day  as they were walking together
from the park to the cottage   but pray  are you
personally acquainted with your sister in law s mother 
mrs  ferrars  

elinor did think the question a very odd one 
and her countenance expressed it  as she answered that she
had never seen mrs  ferrars 

 indeed   replied lucy   i wonder at that  for i
thought you must have seen her at norland sometimes 
then  perhaps  you cannot tell me what sort of a woman
she is  

 no   returned elinor  cautious of giving her real
opinion of edward s mother  and not very desirous
of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity  
 i know nothing of her  

 i am sure you think me very strange  for enquiring
about her in such a way   said lucy  eyeing elinor attentively
as she spoke   but perhaps there may be reasons  i wish
i might venture  but however i hope you will do me the justice
of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent  

elinor made her a civil reply  and they walked on
for a few minutes in silence   it was broken by lucy 
who renewed the subject again by saying  with some
hesitation 

 i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious 
i am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be
thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth
having as yours   and i am sure i should not have the smallest
fear of trusting you  indeed  i should be very glad of your
advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation
as i am  but  however  there is no occasion to trouble you 
i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs  ferrars  

 i am sorry i do not   said elinor  in great astonishment 
 if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her 
but really i never understood that you were at all connected
with that family  and therefore i am a little surprised 
i confess  at so serious an inquiry into her character  

 i dare say you are  and i am sure i do not at all
wonder at it   but if i dared tell you all  you would not be
so much surprised   mrs  ferrars is certainly nothing to me
at present  but the time may come  how soon it will come
must depend upon herself  when we may be very intimately
connected  

she looked down as she said this  amiably bashful 
with only one side glance at her companion to observe its
effect on her 

 good heavens   cried elinor   what do you mean 
are you acquainted with mr  robert ferrars   can you be  
and she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such
a sister in law 

 no   replied lucy   not to mr  robert ferrars  i
never saw him in my life  but   fixing her eyes upon elinor 
 to his eldest brother  

what felt elinor at that moment  astonishment 
that would have been as painful as it was strong  had not
an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it 
she turned towards lucy in silent amazement  unable to divine
the reason or object of such a declaration  and though
her complexion varied  she stood firm in incredulity 
and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit  or a swoon 

 you may well be surprised   continued lucy 
 for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before 
for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it
to you or any of your family  because it was always meant
to be a great secret  and i am sure has been faithfully
kept so by me to this hour   not a soul of all my relations
know of it but anne  and i never should have mentioned
it to you  if i had not felt the greatest dependence
in the world upon your secrecy  and i really thought my
behaviour in asking so many questions about mrs  ferrars
must seem so odd  that it ought to be explained 
and i do not think mr  ferrars can be displeased 
when he knows i have trusted you  because i know he has
the highest opinion in the world of all your family 
and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite
as his own sisters    she paused 

elinor for a few moments remained silent 
her astonishment at what she heard was at first too
great for words  but at length forcing herself to speak 
and to speak cautiously  she said  with calmness of manner 
which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude  
 may i ask if your engagement is of long standing  

 we have been engaged these four years  

 four years  

 yes  

elinor  though greatly shocked  still felt unable
to believe it 

 i did not know   said she   that you were even
acquainted till the other day  

 our acquaintance  however  is of many years date 
he was under my uncle s care  you know  a considerable while  

 your uncle  

 yes  mr  pratt   did you never hear him talk
of mr  pratt  

 i think i have   replied elinor  with an exertion
of spirits  which increased with her increase of emotion 

 he was four years with my uncle  who lives at longstaple 
near plymouth   it was there our acquaintance begun 
for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle 
and it was there our engagement was formed  though not till
a year after he had quitted as a pupil  but he was almost
always with us afterwards   i was very unwilling to enter
into it  as you may imagine  without the knowledge and
approbation of his mother  but i was too young  and loved
him too well  to be so prudent as i ought to have been   
though you do not know him so well as me  miss dashwood 
you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is
very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him  

 certainly   answered elinor  without knowing what
she said  but after a moment s reflection  she added 
with revived security of edward s honour and love 
and her companion s falsehood   engaged to mr  edward
ferrars   i confess myself so totally surprised at
what you tell me  that really  i beg your pardon 
but surely there must be some mistake of person or name 
we cannot mean the same mr  ferrars  

 we can mean no other   cried lucy  smiling    mr  edward
ferrars  the eldest son of mrs  ferrars  of park street 
and brother of your sister in law  mrs  john dashwood 
is the person i mean  you must allow that i am not likely
to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness
depends  

 it is strange   replied elinor  in a most painful perplexity 
 that i should never have heard him even mention your name  

 no  considering our situation  it was not strange 
our first care has been to keep the matter secret   
you knew nothing of me  or my family  and  therefore 
there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name
to you  and  as he was always particularly afraid of his
sister s suspecting any thing  that was reason enough
for his not mentioning it  

she was silent   elinor s security sunk  but her
self command did not sink with it 

 four years you have been engaged   said she
with a firm voice 

 yes  and heaven knows how much longer we may have
to wait   poor edward   it puts him quite out of heart  
then taking a small miniature from her pocket  she added 
 to prevent the possibility of mistake  be so good as to look
at this face   it does not do him justice  to be sure 
but yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person
it was drew for   i have had it above these three years  

she put it into her hands as she spoke  and when elinor
saw the painting  whatever other doubts her fear of a
too hasty decision  or her wish of detecting falsehood
might suffer to linger in her mind  she could have none of
its being edward s face   she returned it almost instantly 
acknowledging the likeness 

 i have never been able   continued lucy   to give
him my picture in return  which i am very much vexed at 
for he has been always so anxious to get it   but i am
determined to set for it the very first opportunity  

 you are quite in the right   replied elinor calmly 
they then proceeded a few paces in silence   lucy spoke first 

 i am sure   said she   i have no doubt in the world
of your faithfully keeping this secret  because you must
know of what importance it is to us  not to have it reach
his mother  for she would never approve of it  i dare say 
i shall have no fortune  and i fancy she is an exceeding
proud woman  

 i certainly did not seek your confidence   said elinor 
 but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i
may be depended on   your secret is safe with me 
but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary
a communication   you must at least have felt that my
being acquainted with it could not add to its safety  

as she said this  she looked earnestly at lucy 
hoping to discover something in her countenance  perhaps the
falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying 
but lucy s countenance suffered no change 

 i was afraid you would think i was taking a great
liberty with you   said she   in telling you all this 
i have not known you long to be sure  personally at least 
but i have known you and all your family by description
a great while  and as soon as i saw you  i felt almost as if
you was an old acquaintance   besides in the present case 
i really thought some explanation was due to you after my
making such particular inquiries about edward s mother 
and i am so unfortunate  that i have not a creature whose
advice i can ask   anne is the only person that knows of it 
and she has no judgment at all  indeed  she does me a great
deal more harm than good  for i am in constant fear of her
betraying me   she does not know how to hold her tongue 
as you must perceive  and i am sure i was in the greatest
fright in the world t other day  when edward s name was
mentioned by sir john  lest she should out with it all 
you can t think how much i go through in my mind from
it altogether   i only wonder that i am alive after what
i have suffered for edward s sake these last four years 
every thing in such suspense and uncertainty  and seeing
him so seldom  we can hardly meet above twice a year 
i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke  

here she took out her handkerchief  but elinor did
not feel very compassionate 

 sometimes   continued lucy  after wiping her eyes 
 i think whether it would not be better for us both
to break off the matter entirely    as she said this 
she looked directly at her companion    but then
at other times i have not resolution enough for it   
i cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable 
as i know the very mention of such a thing would do 
and on my own account too  so dear as he is to me  i don t
think i could be equal to it   what would you advise
me to do in such a case  miss dashwood   what would you
do yourself  

 pardon me   replied elinor  startled by the question 
 but i can give you no advice under such circumstances 
your own judgment must direct you  

 to be sure   continued lucy  after a few minutes
silence on both sides   his mother must provide for him
sometime or other  but poor edward is so cast down by it 
did you not think him dreadful low spirited when he was at
barton   he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple 
to go to you  that i was afraid you would think him quite ill  

 did he come from your uncle s  then  when he visited us  

 oh  yes  he had been staying a fortnight with us 
did you think he came directly from town  

 no   replied elinor  most feelingly sensible of
every fresh circumstance in favour of lucy s veracity 
 i remember he told us  that he had been staying
a fortnight with some friends near plymouth  
she remembered too  her own surprise at the time 
at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends 
at his total silence with respect even to their names 

 did not you think him sadly out of spirits  
repeated lucy 

 we did  indeed  particularly so when he first arrived  

 i begged him to exert himself for fear you
should suspect what was the matter  but it made him
so melancholy  not being able to stay more than a
fortnight with us  and seeing me so much affected   
poor fellow   i am afraid it is just the same with him now 
for he writes in wretched spirits   i heard from him just
before i left exeter   taking a letter from her pocket
and carelessly showing the direction to elinor 
 you know his hand  i dare say  a charming one it is 
but that is not written so well as usual   he was tired 
i dare say  for he had just filled the sheet to me as full
as possible  

elinor saw that it was his hand  and she could doubt
no longer   this picture  she had allowed herself to believe 
might have been accidentally obtained  it might not have
been edward s gift  but a correspondence between them
by letter  could subsist only under a positive engagement 
could be authorised by nothing else  for a few moments  she
was almost overcome  her heart sunk within her  and she could
hardly stand  but exertion was indispensably necessary 
and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression
of her feelings  that her success was speedy  and for
the time complete 

 writing to each other   said lucy  returning the
letter into her pocket   is the only comfort we have
in such long separations   yes  i have one other comfort
in his picture  but poor edward has not even that 
if he had but my picture  he says he should be easy 
i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at
longstaple last  and that was some comfort to him  he said 
but not equal to a picture   perhaps you might notice
the ring when you saw him  

 i did   said elinor  with a composure of voice 
under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond
any thing she had ever felt before   she was mortified 
shocked  confounded 

fortunately for her  they had now reached the cottage 
and the conversation could be continued no farther 
after sitting with them a few minutes  the miss steeles
returned to the park  and elinor was then at liberty
to think and be wretched

chapter 23


however small elinor s general dependence on
lucy s veracity might be  it was impossible for her
on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case 
where no temptation could be answerable to the folly
of inventing a falsehood of such a description   what lucy
had asserted to be true  therefore  elinor could not 
dared not longer doubt  supported as it was too on every
side by such probabilities and proofs  and contradicted
by nothing but her own wishes   their opportunity of
acquaintance in the house of mr  pratt was a foundation
for the rest  at once indisputable and alarming  and edward s
visit near plymouth  his melancholy state of mind 
his dissatisfaction at his own prospects  his uncertain
behaviour towards herself  the intimate knowledge of the
miss steeles as to norland and their family connections 
which had often surprised her  the picture  the letter 
the ring  formed altogether such a body of evidence 
as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly 
and established as a fact  which no partiality could
set aside  his ill treatment of herself   her resentment
of such behaviour  her indignation at having been its dupe 
for a short time made her feel only for herself 
but other ideas  other considerations  soon arose 
had edward been intentionally deceiving her   had he feigned
a regard for her which he did not feel   was his engagement
to lucy an engagement of the heart   no  whatever it might
once have been  she could not believe it such at present 
his affection was all her own   she could not be deceived
in that   her mother  sisters  fanny  all had been
conscious of his regard for her at norland  it was not
an illusion of her own vanity   he certainly loved her 
what a softener of the heart was this persuasion   how much
could it not tempt her to forgive   he had been blamable 
highly blamable  in remaining at norland after he first
felt her influence over him to be more than it ought
to be   in that  he could not be defended  but if he
had injured her  how much more had he injured himself 
if her case were pitiable  his was hopeless 
his imprudence had made her miserable for a while  but it
seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever
being otherwise   she might in time regain tranquillity 
but he  what had he to look forward to   could he
ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele  could he 
were his affection for herself out of the question 
with his integrity  his delicacy  and well informed mind 
be satisfied with a wife like her  illiterate  artful 
and selfish 

the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally
blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature 
but the four succeeding years  years  which if rationally
spent  give such improvement to the understanding  must
have opened his eyes to her defects of education 
while the same period of time  spent on her side
in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits 
had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might
once have given an interesting character to her beauty 

if in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself 
his difficulties from his mother had seemed great 
how much greater were they now likely to be  when
the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior
in connections  and probably inferior in fortune to herself 
these difficulties  indeed  with a heart so alienated
from lucy  might not press very hard upon his patience 
but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the
expectation of family opposition and unkindness  could
be felt as a relief 

as these considerations occurred to her in painful
succession  she wept for him  more than for herself 
supported by the conviction of having done nothing to
merit her present unhappiness  and consoled by the belief
that edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem 
she thought she could even now  under the first smart
of the heavy blow  command herself enough to guard every
suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters 
and so well was she able to answer her own expectations 
that when she joined them at dinner only two hours
after she had first suffered the extinction of all her
dearest hopes  no one would have supposed from the
appearance of the sisters  that elinor was mourning
in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever
from the object of her love  and that marianne was
internally dwelling on the perfections of a man  of whose
whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed  and whom she
expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house 

the necessity of concealing from her mother and
marianne  what had been entrusted in confidence to herself 
though it obliged her to unceasing exertion  was no
aggravation of elinor s distress   on the contrary
it was a relief to her  to be spared the communication
of what would give such affliction to them  and to be
saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward 
which would probably flow from the excess of their partial
affection for herself  and which was more than she felt
equal to support 

from their counsel  or their conversation  she knew
she could receive no assistance  their tenderness and
sorrow must add to her distress  while her self command
would neither receive encouragement from their example
nor from their praise   she was stronger alone 
and her own good sense so well supported her  that her
firmness was as unshaken  her appearance of cheerfulness
as invariable  as with regrets so poignant and so fresh 
it was possible for them to be 

much as she had suffered from her first conversation
with lucy on the subject  she soon felt an earnest wish
of renewing it  and this for more reasons than one 
she wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement
repeated again  she wanted more clearly to understand
what lucy really felt for edward  whether there were any
sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him 
and she particularly wanted to convince lucy  by her
readiness to enter on the matter again  and her calmness
in conversing on it  that she was no otherwise interested
in it than as a friend  which she very much feared
her involuntary agitation  in their morning discourse 
must have left at least doubtful   that lucy was disposed
to be jealous of her appeared very probable  it was plain
that edward had always spoken highly in her praise 
not merely from lucy s assertion  but from her venturing
to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance 
with a secret so confessedly and evidently important 
and even sir john s joking intelligence must have had
some weight   but indeed  while elinor remained so well
assured within herself of being really beloved by edward 
it required no other consideration of probabilities
to make it natural that lucy should be jealous 
and that she was so  her very confidence was a proof 
what other reason for the disclosure of the affair could
there be  but that elinor might be informed by it of lucy s
superior claims on edward  and be taught to avoid him
in future   she had little difficulty in understanding thus
much of her rival s intentions  and while she was firmly
resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and
honesty directed  to combat her own affection for edward
and to see him as little as possible  she could not deny
herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy
that her heart was unwounded   and as she could now have
nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already
been told  she did not mistrust her own ability of going
through a repetition of particulars with composure 

but it was not immediately that an opportunity
of doing so could be commanded  though lucy was as well
disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred 
for the weather was not often fine enough to allow
of their joining in a walk  where they might most easily
separate themselves from the others  and though they
met at least every other evening either at the park
or cottage  and chiefly at the former  they could
not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation 
such a thought would never enter either sir john or lady
middleton s head  and therefore very little leisure
was ever given for a general chat  and none at all for
particular discourse   they met for the sake of eating 
drinking  and laughing together  playing at cards 
or consequences  or any other game that was sufficiently noisy 

one or two meetings of this kind had taken place 
without affording elinor any chance of engaging lucy
in private  when sir john called at the cottage one morning 
to beg  in the name of charity  that they would all
dine with lady middleton that day  as he was obliged
to attend the club at exeter  and she would otherwise be
quite alone  except her mother and the two miss steeles 
elinor  who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she
had in view  in such a party as this was likely to be 
more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil
and well bred direction of lady middleton than when
her husband united them together in one noisy purpose 
immediately accepted the invitation  margaret  with her
mother s permission  was equally compliant  and marianne 
though always unwilling to join any of their parties 
was persuaded by her mother  who could not bear to have her
seclude herself from any chance of amusement  to go likewise 

the young ladies went  and lady middleton was happily
preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her 
the insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as elinor
had expected  it produced not one novelty of thought
or expression  and nothing could be less interesting
than the whole of their discourse both in the dining
parlour and drawing room  to the latter  the children
accompanied them  and while they remained there  she was
too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging lucy s
attention to attempt it   they quitted it only with the
removal of the tea things   the card table was then placed 
and elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever
entertained a hope of finding time for conversation
at the park   they all rose up in preparation for a round game 

 i am glad   said lady middleton to lucy 
 you are not going to finish poor little annamaria s
basket this evening  for i am sure it must hurt your
eyes to work filigree by candlelight   and we will make
the dear little love some amends for her disappointment
to morrow  and then i hope she will not much mind it  

this hint was enough  lucy recollected herself instantly
and replied   indeed you are very much mistaken 
lady middleton  i am only waiting to know whether you can
make your party without me  or i should have been at my
filigree already   i would not disappoint the little angel
for all the world  and if you want me at the card table now 
i am resolved to finish the basket after supper  

 you are very good  i hope it won t hurt your eyes  
will you ring the bell for some working candles 
my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed  i know 
if the basket was not finished tomorrow  for though i
told her it certainly would not  i am sure she depends
upon having it done  

lucy directly drew her work table near her
and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness
which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater
delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child 

lady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others 
no one made any objection but marianne  who with her usual
inattention to the forms of general civility  exclaimed 
 your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me  you
know i detest cards   i shall go to the piano forte 
i have not touched it since it was tuned    and without
farther ceremony  she turned away and walked to the instrument 

lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven
that she had never made so rude a speech 

 marianne can never keep long from that instrument
you know  ma am   said elinor  endeavouring to smooth
away the offence   and i do not much wonder at it  for it
is the very best toned piano forte i ever heard  

the remaining five were now to draw their cards 

 perhaps   continued elinor   if i should happen
to cut out  i may be of some use to miss lucy steele 
in rolling her papers for her  and there is so much still
to be done to the basket  that it must be impossible
i think for her labour singly  to finish it this evening 
i should like the work exceedingly  if she would allow
me a share in it  

 indeed i shall be very much obliged to you
for your help   cried lucy   for i find there is more
to be done to it than i thought there was  and it would
be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all  

 oh  that would be terrible  indeed   said miss steele  
 dear little soul  how i do love her  

 you are very kind   said lady middleton to elinor 
 and as you really like the work  perhaps you will be
as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber 
or will you take your chance now  

elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals 
and thus by a little of that address which marianne
could never condescend to practise  gained her own end 
and pleased lady middleton at the same time   lucy made room
for her with ready attention  and the two fair rivals were
thus seated side by side at the same table  and  with the
utmost harmony  engaged in forwarding the same work 
the pianoforte at which marianne  wrapped up in her own
music and her own thoughts  had by this time forgotten
that any body was in the room besides herself  was luckily
so near them that miss dashwood now judged she might safely 
under the shelter of its noise  introduce the interesting
subject  without any risk of being heard at the card table 



chapter 24


in a firm  though cautious tone  elinor thus began 

 i should be undeserving of the confidence you have
honoured me with  if i felt no desire for its continuance 
or no farther curiosity on its subject   i will
not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again  

 thank you   cried lucy warmly   for breaking
the ice  you have set my heart at ease by it  for i was
somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i
told you that monday  

 offended me  how could you suppose so  believe me  
and elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity 
 nothing could be farther from my intention than to give
you such an idea   could you have a motive for the trust 
that was not honourable and flattering to me  

 and yet i do assure you   replied lucy  her little
sharp eyes full of meaning   there seemed to me to be
a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me
quite uncomfortable   i felt sure that you was angry with me 
and have been quarrelling with myself ever since  for having
took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs 
but i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy 
and that you really do not blame me   if you knew what a
consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you
of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life 
your compassion would make you overlook every thing else
i am sure  

 indeed  i can easily believe that it was a very great
relief to you  to acknowledge your situation to me  and be
assured that you shall never have reason to repent it 
your case is a very unfortunate one  you seem to me to
be surrounded with difficulties  and you will have need
of all your mutual affection to support you under them 
mr  ferrars  i believe  is entirely dependent on his mother  

 he has only two thousand pounds of his own  it would
be madness to marry upon that  though for my own part 
i could give up every prospect of more without a sigh 
i have been always used to a very small income  and could
struggle with any poverty for him  but i love him too well
to be the selfish means of robbing him  perhaps  of all that
his mother might give him if he married to please her 
we must wait  it may be for many years   with almost every
other man in the world  it would be an alarming prospect 
but edward s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of
i know  

 that conviction must be every thing to you 
and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your s 
if the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed 
as between many people  and under many circumstances
it naturally would during a four years  engagement 
your situation would have been pitiable  indeed  

lucy here looked up  but elinor was careful
in guarding her countenance from every expression
that could give her words a suspicious tendency 

 edward s love for me   said lucy   has been pretty
well put to the test  by our long  very long absence
since we were first engaged  and it has stood the trial
so well  that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now 
i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s
alarm on that account from the first  

elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh
at this assertion 

lucy went on    i am rather of a jealous temper too
by nature  and from our different situations in life 
from his being so much more in the world than me  and our
continual separation  i was enough inclined for suspicion 
to have found out the truth in an instant  if there had been
the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met 
or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for 
or if he had talked more of one lady than another 
or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he
used to be   i do not mean to say that i am particularly
observant or quick sighted in general  but in such a case
i am sure i could not be deceived  

 all this   thought elinor   is very pretty 
but it can impose upon neither of us  

 but what   said she after a short silence 
 are your views  or have you none but that of waiting for
mrs  ferrars s death  which is a melancholy and shocking
extremity   is her son determined to submit to this 
and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense
in which it may involve you  rather than run the risk
of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth  

 if we could be certain that it would be only
for a while   but mrs  ferrars is a very headstrong
proud woman  and in her first fit of anger upon hearing
it  would very likely secure every thing to robert 
and the idea of that  for edward s sake  frightens away
all my inclination for hasty measures  

 and for your own sake too  or you are carrying
your disinterestedness beyond reason  

lucy looked at elinor again  and was silent 

 do you know mr  robert ferrars   asked elinor 

 not at all  i never saw him  but i fancy he
is very unlike his brother  silly and a great coxcomb  

 a great coxcomb   repeated miss steele  whose ear had
caught those words by a sudden pause in marianne s music   
 oh  they are talking of their favourite beaux  i dare say  

 no sister   cried lucy   you are mistaken there  our
favourite beaux are not great coxcombs  

 i can answer for it that miss dashwood s is not  
said mrs  jennings  laughing heartily   for he is one
of the modestest  prettiest behaved young men i ever saw 
but as for lucy  she is such a sly little creature 
there is no finding out who she likes  

 oh   cried miss steele  looking significantly round
at them   i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest
and pretty behaved as miss dashwood s  

elinor blushed in spite of herself   lucy bit her lip 
and looked angrily at her sister   a mutual silence took
place for some time   lucy first put an end to it by saying
in a lower tone  though marianne was then giving them
the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto  

 i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has
lately come into my head  for bringing matters to bear 
indeed i am bound to let you into the secret  for you
are a party concerned   i dare say you have seen enough
of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every
other profession  now my plan is that he should take
orders as soon as he can  and then through your interest 
which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of
friendship for him  and i hope out of some regard to me 
your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living 
which i understand is a very good one  and the present
incumbent not likely to live a great while   that would
be enough for us to marry upon  and we might trust to time
and chance for the rest  

 i should always be happy   replied elinor   to show
any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr  ferrars 
but do you not perceive that my interest on such an
occasion would be perfectly unnecessary   he is brother
to mrs  john dashwood  that must be recommendation enough
to her husband  

 but mrs  john dashwood would not much approve
of edward s going into orders  

 then i rather suspect that my interest would
do very little  

they were again silent for many minutes   at length
lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh 

 i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end
to the business at once by dissolving the engagement 
we seem so beset with difficulties on every side 
that though it would make us miserable for a time 
we should be happier perhaps in the end   but you will
not give me your advice  miss dashwood  

 no   answered elinor  with a smile  which concealed
very agitated feelings   on such a subject i certainly
will not   you know very well that my opinion would have
no weight with you  unless it were on the side of your wishes  

 indeed you wrong me   replied lucy  with great
solemnity   i know nobody of whose judgment i think
so highly as i do of yours  and i do really believe 
that if you was to say to me   i advise you by all means
to put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars 
it will be more for the happiness of both of you  
i should resolve upon doing it immediately  

elinor blushed for the insincerity of edward s
future wife  and replied   this compliment would effectually
frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject
had i formed one   it raises my influence much too high 
the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached
is too much for an indifferent person  

  tis because you are an indifferent person   said lucy 
with some pique  and laying a particular stress on those words 
 that your judgment might justly have such weight with me 
if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect
by your own feelings  your opinion would not be worth having  

elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this 
lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase
of ease and unreserve  and was even partly determined
never to mention the subject again   another pause
therefore of many minutes  duration  succeeded this speech 
and lucy was still the first to end it 

 shall you be in town this winter  miss dashwood  
said she with all her accustomary complacency 

 certainly not  

 i am sorry for that   returned the other 
while her eyes brightened at the information 
 it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there 
but i dare say you will go for all that   to be sure 
your brother and sister will ask you to come to them  

 it will not be in my power to accept their invitation
if they do  

 how unlucky that is  i had quite depended upon
meeting you there   anne and me are to go the latter end
of january to some relations who have been wanting us to
visit them these several years   but i only go for the sake
of seeing edward   he will be there in february  otherwise
london would have no charms for me  i have not spirits for it  

elinor was soon called to the card table by the
conclusion of the first rubber  and the confidential
discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end 
to which both of them submitted without any reluctance 
for nothing had been said on either side to make them
dislike each other less than they had done before 
and elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy
persuasion that edward was not only without affection
for the person who was to be his wife  but that he had
not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage 
which sincere affection on her side would have given 
for self interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man
to an engagement  of which she seemed so thoroughly aware
that he was weary 

from this time the subject was never revived by elinor 
and when entered on by lucy  who seldom missed an opportunity
of introducing it  and was particularly careful to inform
her confidante  of her happiness whenever she received a letter
from edward  it was treated by the former with calmness
and caution  and dismissed as soon as civility would allow 
for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which
lucy did not deserve  and which were dangerous to herself 

the visit of the miss steeles at barton park was
lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied 
their favour increased  they could not be spared 
sir john would not hear of their going  and in spite
of their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter 
in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill
them immediately  which was in full force at the end
of every week  they were prevailed on to stay nearly two
months at the park  and to assist in the due celebration
of that festival which requires a more than ordinary
share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim
its importance 



chapter 25


though mrs  jennings was in the habit of spending a large
portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends 
she was not without a settled habitation of her own 
since the death of her husband  who had traded with success
in a less elegant part of the town  she had resided every
winter in a house in one of the streets near portman square 
towards this home  she began on the approach of january
to turn her thoughts  and thither she one day abruptly 
and very unexpectedly by them  asked the elder misses
dashwood to accompany her   elinor  without observing
the varying complexion of her sister  and the animated look
which spoke no indifference to the plan  immediately gave
a grateful but absolute denial for both  in which she
believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations 
the reason alleged was their determined resolution
of not leaving their mother at that time of the year 
mrs  jennings received the refusal with some surprise 
and repeated her invitation immediately 

 oh  lord  i am sure your mother can spare you
very well  and i do beg you will favour me with
your company  for i ve quite set my heart upon it 
don t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me 
for i shan t put myself at all out of my way for you 
it will only be sending betty by the coach  and i
hope i can afford that   we three shall be able to go
very well in my chaise  and when we are in town 
if you do not like to go wherever i do  well and good 
you may always go with one of my daughters   i am sure
your mother will not object to it  for i have had such
good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she
will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you 
and if i don t get one of you at least well married
before i have done with you  it shall not be my fault 
i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men 
you may depend upon it  

 i have a notion   said sir john   that miss marianne
would not object to such a scheme  if her elder sister
would come into it   it is very hard indeed that she
should not have a little pleasure  because miss dashwood
does not wish it   so i would advise you two  to set off
for town  when you are tired of barton  without saying
a word to miss dashwood about it  

 nay   cried mrs  jennings   i am sure i shall be
monstrous glad of miss marianne s company  whether miss
dashwood will go or not  only the more the merrier say i 
and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to
be together  because  if they got tired of me  they might talk
to one another  and laugh at my old ways behind my back 
but one or the other  if not both of them  i must have 
lord bless me  how do you think i can live poking by myself 
i who have been always used till this winter to have
charlotte with me   come  miss marianne  let us strike
hands upon the bargain  and if miss dashwood will change
her mind by and bye  why so much the better  

 i thank you  ma am  sincerely thank you   said marianne 
with warmth   your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever 
and it would give me such happiness  yes  almost the greatest
happiness i am capable of  to be able to accept it 
but my mother  my dearest  kindest mother   i feel the
justice of what elinor has urged  and if she were to be
made less happy  less comfortable by our absence  oh  no 
nothing should tempt me to leave her   it should not 
must not be a struggle  

mrs  jennings repeated her assurance that mrs  dashwood
could spare them perfectly well  and elinor  who now
understood her sister  and saw to what indifference to
almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness
to be with willoughby again  made no farther direct
opposition to the plan  and merely referred it to her
mother s decision  from whom however she scarcely expected
to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit 
which she could not approve of for marianne  and which
on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid 
whatever marianne was desirous of  her mother would be eager
to promote  she could not expect to influence the latter
to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she
had never been able to inspire her with distrust  and she
dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination
for going to london   that marianne  fastidious as she was 
thoroughly acquainted with mrs  jennings  manners 
and invariably disgusted by them  should overlook every
inconvenience of that kind  should disregard whatever
must be most wounding to her irritable feelings  in her
pursuit of one object  was such a proof  so strong 
so full  of the importance of that object to her  as elinor 
in spite of all that had passed  was not prepared to witness 

on being informed of the invitation  mrs  dashwood 
persuaded that such an excursion would be productive
of much amusement to both her daughters  and perceiving
through all her affectionate attention to herself 
how much the heart of marianne was in it  would not hear
of their declining the offer upon her account  insisted on
their both accepting it directly  and then began to foresee 
with her usual cheerfulness  a variety of advantages that
would accrue to them all  from this separation 

 i am delighted with the plan   she cried 
 it is exactly what i could wish   margaret and i shall
be as much benefited by it as yourselves   when you
and the middletons are gone  we shall go on so quietly
and happily together with our books and our music  you
will find margaret so improved when you come back again 
i have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too 
which may now be performed without any inconvenience
to any one   it is very right that you should go to town 
i would have every young woman of your condition in life
acquainted with the manners and amusements of london 
you will be under the care of a motherly good sort
of woman  of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt 
and in all probability you will see your brother 
and whatever may be his faults  or the faults of his wife 
when i consider whose son he is  i cannot bear to have you so
wholly estranged from each other  

 though with your usual anxiety for our happiness  
said elinor   you have been obviating every impediment
to the present scheme which occurred to you  there is
still one objection which  in my opinion  cannot be so
easily removed  

marianne s countenance sunk 

 and what   said mrs  dashwood   is my dear prudent
elinor going to suggest   what formidable obstacle is she
now to bring forward   do let me hear a word about the
expense of it  

 my objection is this  though i think very well of
mrs  jennings s heart  she is not a woman whose society
can afford us pleasure  or whose protection will give
us consequence  

 that is very true   replied her mother   but of
her society  separately from that of other people 
you will scarcely have any thing at all  and you will
almost always appear in public with lady middleton  

 if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of
mrs  jennings   said marianne   at least it need not prevent
my accepting her invitation   i have no such scruples 
and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness
of that kind with very little effort  

elinor could not help smiling at this display of
indifference towards the manners of a person  to whom she
had often had difficulty in persuading marianne to behave
with tolerable politeness  and resolved within herself 
that if her sister persisted in going  she would
go likewise  as she did not think it proper that marianne
should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment 
or that mrs  jennings should be abandoned to the mercy
of marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours 
to this determination she was the more easily reconciled 
by recollecting that edward ferrars  by lucy s account 
was not to be in town before february  and that
their visit  without any unreasonable abridgement 
might be previously finished 

 i will have you both go   said mrs  dashwood 
 these objections are nonsensical   you will have much
pleasure in being in london  and especially in being together 
and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment 
she would foresee it there from a variety of sources 
she would  perhaps  expect some from improving her
acquaintance with her sister in law s family  

elinor had often wished for an opportunity of
attempting to weaken her mother s dependence on the
attachment of edward and herself  that the shock might
be less when the whole truth were revealed  and now
on this attack  though almost hopeless of success 
she forced herself to begin her design by saying 
as calmly as she could   i like edward ferrars very much 
and shall always be glad to see him  but as to the rest
of the family  it is a matter of perfect indifference
to me  whether i am ever known to them or not  

mrs  dashwood smiled  and said nothing 
marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment  and elinor
conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue 

after very little farther discourse  it was finally
settled that the invitation should be fully accepted 
mrs  jennings received the information with a great
deal of joy  and many assurances of kindness and care 
nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her   sir john
was delighted  for to a man  whose prevailing anxiety
was the dread of being alone  the acquisition of two 
to the number of inhabitants in london  was something 
even lady middleton took the trouble of being delighted 
which was putting herself rather out of her way 
and as for the miss steeles  especially lucy  they had
never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence
made them 

elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted
her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected
to feel   with regard to herself  it was now a matter
of unconcern whether she went to town or not  and when
she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan 
and her sister exhilarated by it in look  voice  and manner 
restored to all her usual animation  and elevated to more
than her usual gaiety  she could not be dissatisfied
with the cause  and would hardly allow herself to distrust
the consequence 

marianne s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness 
so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her
impatience to be gone   her unwillingness to quit her
mother was her only restorative to calmness  and at the
moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive 
her mother s affliction was hardly less  and elinor
was the only one of the three  who seemed to consider
the separation as any thing short of eternal 

their departure took place in the first week in january 
the middletons were to follow in about a week   the miss
steeles kept their station at the park  and were to quit
it only with the rest of the family 



chapter 26


elinor could not find herself in the carriage with mrs  jennings 
and beginning a journey to london under her protection 
and as her guest  without wondering at her own situation 
so short had their acquaintance with that lady been 
so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition 
and so many had been her objections against such a measure
only a few days before  but these objections had all 
with that happy ardour of youth which marianne and her mother
equally shared  been overcome or overlooked  and elinor 
in spite of every occasional doubt of willoughby s constancy 
could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation
which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes
of marianne  without feeling how blank was her own prospect 
how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison 
and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of
marianne s situation to have the same animating object
in view  the same possibility of hope   a short  a very
short time however must now decide what willoughby s
intentions were  in all probability he was already in town 
marianne s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence
on finding him there  and elinor was resolved not only upon
gaining every new light as to his character which her
own observation or the intelligence of others could give her 
but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister
with such zealous attention  as to ascertain what he was
and what he meant  before many meetings had taken place 
should the result of her observations be unfavourable 
she was determined at all events to open the eyes
of her sister  should it be otherwise  her exertions
would be of a different nature  she must then learn
to avoid every selfish comparison  and banish every regret
which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marianne 

they were three days on their journey  and marianne s
behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what
future complaisance and companionableness to mrs  jennings
might be expected to be   she sat in silence almost all
the way  wrapt in her own meditations  and scarcely ever
voluntarily speaking  except when any object of picturesque
beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation
of delight exclusively addressed to her sister   to atone
for this conduct therefore  elinor took immediate possession
of the post of civility which she had assigned herself 
behaved with the greatest attention to mrs  jennings 
talked with her  laughed with her  and listened to her
whenever she could  and mrs  jennings on her side
treated them both with all possible kindness  was solicitous
on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment  and only
disturbed that she could not make them choose their own
dinners at the inn  nor extort a confession of their
preferring salmon to cod  or boiled fowls to veal cutlets 
they reached town by three o clock the third day  glad to
be released  after such a journey  from the confinement
of a carriage  and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire 

the house was handsome  and handsomely fitted up 
and the young ladies were immediately put in possession
of a very comfortable apartment   it had formerly
been charlotte s  and over the mantelpiece still hung
a landscape in coloured silks of her performance 
in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school
in town to some effect 

as dinner was not to be ready in less than two
hours from their arrival  elinor determined to employ
the interval in writing to her mother  and sat down for
that purpose   in a few moments marianne did the same 
 i am writing home  marianne   said elinor   had not you
better defer your letter for a day or two  

 i am not going to write to my mother  
replied marianne  hastily  and as if wishing to avoid
any farther inquiry   elinor said no more  it immediately
struck her that she must then be writing to willoughby 
and the conclusion which as instantly followed was 
that  however mysteriously they might wish to conduct
the affair  they must be engaged   this conviction 
though not entirely satisfactory  gave her pleasure 
and she continued her letter with greater alacrity 
marianne s was finished in a very few minutes 
in length it could be no more than a note  it was then
folded up  sealed  and directed with eager rapidity 
elinor thought she could distinguish a large w in
the direction  and no sooner was it complete than marianne 
ringing the bell  requested the footman who answered it
to get that letter conveyed for her to the two penny post 
this decided the matter at once 

her spirits still continued very high  but there
was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much
pleasure to her sister  and this agitation increased as
the evening drew on   she could scarcely eat any dinner 
and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room 
seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage 

it was a great satisfaction to elinor that mrs  jennings 
by being much engaged in her own room  could see little
of what was passing   the tea things were brought in 
and already had marianne been disappointed more than once
by a rap at a neighbouring door  when a loud one was suddenly
heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house 
elinor felt secure of its announcing willoughby s approach 
and marianne  starting up  moved towards the door 
every thing was silent  this could not be borne many seconds 
she opened the door  advanced a few steps towards the stairs 
and after listening half a minute  returned into the room
in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard
him would naturally produce  in the ecstasy of her
feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming 
 oh  elinor  it is willoughby  indeed it is   and seemed
almost ready to throw herself into his arms  when colonel
brandon appeared 

it was too great a shock to be borne with calmness 
and she immediately left the room   elinor was disappointed too 
but at the same time her regard for colonel brandon ensured
his welcome with her  and she felt particularly hurt that
a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she
experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him 
she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him 
that he even observed marianne as she quitted the room 
with such astonishment and concern  as hardly left him
the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself 

 is your sister ill   said he 

elinor answered in some distress that she was 
and then talked of head aches  low spirits  and over fatigues 
and of every thing to which she could decently attribute
her sister s behaviour 

he heard her with the most earnest attention 
but seeming to recollect himself  said no more on the subject 
and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them
in london  making the usual inquiries about their journey 
and the friends they had left behind 

in this calm kind of way  with very little interest
on either side  they continued to talk  both of them out
of spirits  and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere 
elinor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were
then in town  but she was afraid of giving him pain
by any enquiry after his rival  and at length  by way
of saying something  she asked if he had been in london
ever since she had seen him last    yes   he replied 
with some embarrassment   almost ever since  i have been
once or twice at delaford for a few days  but it has never
been in my power to return to barton  

this  and the manner in which it was said 
immediately brought back to her remembrance all the
circumstances of his quitting that place  with the
uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to mrs  jennings 
and she was fearful that her question had implied
much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt 

mrs  jennings soon came in    oh  colonel   said she 
with her usual noisy cheerfulness   i am monstrous glad
to see you  sorry i could not come before  beg your
pardon  but i have been forced to look about me a little 
and settle my matters  for it is a long while since i
have been at home  and you know one has always a world
of little odd things to do after one has been away for
any time  and then i have had cartwright to settle with  
lord  i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner 
but pray  colonel  how came you to conjure out that i should
be in town today  

 i had the pleasure of hearing it at mr  palmer s 
where i have been dining  

 oh  you did  well  and how do they all do at their
house   how does charlotte do   i warrant you she is a fine
size by this time  

 mrs  palmer appeared quite well  and i am commissioned
to tell you  that you will certainly see her to morrow  

 ay  to be sure  i thought as much   well  colonel 
i have brought two young ladies with me  you see  that is 
you see but one of them now  but there is another somewhere 
your friend  miss marianne  too  which you will not be
sorry to hear   i do not know what you and mr  willoughby
will do between you about her   ay  it is a fine thing
to be young and handsome   well  i was young once  but i
never was very handsome  worse luck for me   however  i got
a very good husband  and i don t know what the greatest
beauty can do more   ah  poor man  he has been dead
these eight years and better   but colonel  where have
you been to since we parted   and how does your business
go on   come  come  let s have no secrets among friends  

he replied with his accustomary mildness to all
her inquiries  but without satisfying her in any 
elinor now began to make the tea  and marianne was
obliged to appear again 

after her entrance  colonel brandon became
more thoughtful and silent than he had been before 
and mrs  jennings could not prevail on him to stay long 
no other visitor appeared that evening  and the ladies
were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed 

marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits
and happy looks   the disappointment of the evening before
seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen
that day   they had not long finished their breakfast before
mrs  palmer s barouche stopped at the door  and in a few
minutes she came laughing into the room  so delighted
to see them all  that it was hard to say whether she
received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss
dashwoods again   so surprised at their coming to town 
though it was what she had rather expected all along 
so angry at their accepting her mother s invitation
after having declined her own  though at the same time
she would never have forgiven them if they had not come 

 mr  palmer will be so happy to see you  
said she   what do you think he said when he heard
of your coming with mamma   i forget what it was now 
but it was something so droll  

after an hour or two spent in what her mother called
comfortable chat  or in other words  in every variety of inquiry
concerning all their acquaintance on mrs  jennings s side 
and in laughter without cause on mrs  palmer s  it was
proposed by the latter that they should all accompany
her to some shops where she had business that morning 
to which mrs  jennings and elinor readily consented 
as having likewise some purchases to make themselves 
and marianne  though declining it at first was induced
to go likewise 

wherever they went  she was evidently always on
the watch   in bond street especially  where much of
their business lay  her eyes were in constant inquiry 
and in whatever shop the party were engaged  her mind was
equally abstracted from every thing actually before them 
from all that interested and occupied the others 
restless and dissatisfied every where  her sister could
never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase 
however it might equally concern them both  she received
no pleasure from anything  was only impatient to be at
home again  and could with difficulty govern her vexation
at the tediousness of mrs  palmer  whose eye was caught
by every thing pretty  expensive  or new  who was wild
to buy all  could determine on none  and dawdled away her
time in rapture and indecision 

it was late in the morning before they returned home 
and no sooner had they entered the house than marianne flew
eagerly up stairs  and when elinor followed  she found
her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance 
which declared that no willoughby had been there 

 has no letter been left here for me since we went out  
said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels 
she was answered in the negative    are you quite sure
of it   she replied    are you certain that no servant 
no porter has left any letter or note  

the man replied that none had 

 how very odd   said she  in a low and disappointed
voice  as she turned away to the window 

 how odd  indeed   repeated elinor within herself 
regarding her sister with uneasiness    if she had not
known him to be in town she would not have written to him 
as she did  she would have written to combe magna 
and if he is in town  how odd that he should neither
come nor write   oh  my dear mother  you must be wrong
in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young 
a man so little known  to be carried on in so doubtful 
so mysterious a manner   i long to inquire  and how will my
interference be borne  

she determined  after some consideration  that if
appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they
now were  she would represent in the strongest manner
to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the
affair 

mrs  palmer and two elderly ladies of mrs  jennings s
intimate acquaintance  whom she had met and invited
in the morning  dined with them   the former left them
soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements 
and elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table
for the others   marianne was of no use on these occasions 
as she would never learn the game  but though her time
was therefore at her own disposal  the evening was by no
means more productive of pleasure to her than to elinor 
for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the
pain of disappointment   she sometimes endeavoured for a
few minutes to read  but the book was soon thrown aside 
and she returned to the more interesting employment
of walking backwards and forwards across the room 
pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window 
in hopes of distinguishing the long expected rap 



chapter 27


 if this open weather holds much longer   said mrs  jennings 
when they met at breakfast the following morning 
 sir john will not like leaving barton next week 
 tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day s pleasure 
poor souls   i always pity them when they do  they seem
to take it so much to heart  

 that is true   cried marianne  in a cheerful voice 
and walking to the window as she spoke  to examine the day 
 i had not thought of that   this weather will keep many
sportsmen in the country  

it was a lucky recollection  all her good spirits were
restored by it    it is charming weather for them indeed  
she continued  as she sat down to the breakfast table
with a happy countenance    how much they must enjoy
it  but   with a little return of anxiety   it cannot
be expected to last long   at this time of the year 
and after such a series of rain  we shall certainly
have very little more of it   frosts will soon set in 
and in all probability with severity   in another day
or two perhaps  this extreme mildness can hardly last
longer  nay  perhaps it may freeze tonight  

 at any rate   said elinor  wishing to prevent
mrs  jennings from seeing her sister s thoughts as clearly
as she did   i dare say we shall have sir john and lady
middleton in town by the end of next week  

 ay  my dear  i ll warrant you we do   mary always
has her own way  

 and now   silently conjectured elinor   she will
write to combe by this day s post  

but if she did  the letter was written and sent away
with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain
the fact   whatever the truth of it might be  and far
as elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it 
yet while she saw marianne in spirits  she could not be
very uncomfortable herself   and marianne was in spirits 
happy in the mildness of the weather  and still happier
in her expectation of a frost 

the morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at
the houses of mrs  jennings s acquaintance to inform
them of her being in town  and marianne was all the time
busy in observing the direction of the wind  watching the
variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air 

 don t you find it colder than it was in the morning 
elinor  there seems to me a very decided difference 
i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff   it was
not so yesterday  i think   the clouds seem parting too 
the sun will be out in a moment  and we shall have a
clear afternoon  

elinor was alternately diverted and pained 
but marianne persevered  and saw every night in the
brightness of the fire  and every morning in the appearance
of the atmosphere  the certain symptoms of approaching frost 

the miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be
dissatisfied with mrs  jennings s style of living  and set
of acquaintance  than with her behaviour to themselves 
which was invariably kind   every thing in her household
arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan 
and excepting a few old city friends  whom  to lady
middleton s regret  she had never dropped  she visited
no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose
the feelings of her young companions   pleased to find
herself more comfortably situated in that particular than
she had expected  elinor was very willing to compound
for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their
evening parties  which  whether at home or abroad 
formed only for cards  could have little to amuse her 

colonel brandon  who had a general invitation
to the house  was with them almost every day  he came
to look at marianne and talk to elinor  who often derived
more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any
other daily occurrence  but who saw at the same time
with much concern his continued regard for her sister 
she feared it was a strengthening regard   it grieved her
to see the earnestness with which he often watched marianne 
and his spirits were certainly worse than when at barton 

about a week after their arrival  it became
certain that willoughby was also arrived   his card
was on the table when they came in from the morning s drive 

 good god   cried marianne   he has been here while
we were out    elinor  rejoiced to be assured of his
being in london  now ventured to say   depend upon it 
he will call again tomorrow    but marianne seemed
hardly to hear her  and on mrs  jenning s entrance 
escaped with the precious card 

this event  while it raised the spirits of elinor 
restored to those of her sister all  and more than all 
their former agitation   from this moment her mind was
never quiet  the expectation of seeing him every hour
of the day  made her unfit for any thing   she insisted
on being left behind  the next morning  when the others
went out 

elinor s thoughts were full of what might be passing
in berkeley street during their absence  but a moment s
glance at her sister when they returned was enough to
inform her  that willoughby had paid no second visit there 
a note was just then brought in  and laid on the table 

 for me   cried marianne  stepping hastily forward 

 no  ma am  for my mistress  

but marianne  not convinced  took it instantly up 

 it is indeed for mrs  jennings  how provoking  

 you are expecting a letter  then   said elinor 
unable to be longer silent 

 yes  a little  not much  

after a short pause    you have no confidence
in me  marianne  

 nay  elinor  this reproach from you  you who have
confidence in no one  

 me   returned elinor in some confusion   indeed 
marianne  i have nothing to tell  

 nor i   answered marianne with energy   our situations
then are alike   we have neither of us any thing to tell 
you  because you do not communicate  and i  because
i conceal nothing  

elinor  distressed by this charge of reserve in herself 
which she was not at liberty to do away  knew not how 
under such circumstances  to press for greater openness
in marianne 

mrs  jennings soon appeared  and the note being
given her  she read it aloud   it was from lady middleton 
announcing their arrival in conduit street the night before 
and requesting the company of her mother and cousins
the following evening   business on sir john s part 
and a violent cold on her own  prevented their calling
in berkeley street   the invitation was accepted 
but when the hour of appointment drew near  necessary as
it was in common civility to mrs  jennings  that they
should both attend her on such a visit  elinor had some
difficulty in persuading her sister to go  for still
she had seen nothing of willoughby  and therefore was
not more indisposed for amusement abroad  than unwilling
to run the risk of his calling again in her absence 

elinor found  when the evening was over 
that disposition is not materially altered by a change
of abode  for although scarcely settled in town 
sir john had contrived to collect around him  nearly twenty
young people  and to amuse them with a ball   this was
an affair  however  of which lady middleton did not approve 
in the country  an unpremeditated dance was very allowable 
but in london  where the reputation of elegance was more
important and less easily attained  it was risking too much
for the gratification of a few girls  to have it known that
lady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple 
with two violins  and a mere side board collation 

mr  and mrs  palmer were of the party  from the former 
whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town 
as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention
to his mother in law  and therefore never came near her 
they received no mark of recognition on their entrance 
he looked at them slightly  without seeming to know
who they were  and merely nodded to mrs  jennings from
the other side of the room   marianne gave one glance
round the apartment as she entered  it was enough  he
was not there  and she sat down  equally ill disposed
to receive or communicate pleasure   after they had been
assembled about an hour  mr  palmer sauntered towards
the miss dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them
in town  though colonel brandon had been first informed
of their arrival at his house  and he had himself said
something very droll on hearing that they were to come 

 i thought you were both in devonshire   said he 

 did you   replied elinor 

 when do you go back again  

 i do not know   and thus ended their discourse 

never had marianne been so unwilling to dance
in her life  as she was that evening  and never so much
fatigued by the exercise   she complained of it
as they returned to berkeley street 

 aye  aye   said mrs  jennings   we know the reason
of all that very well  if a certain person who shall
be nameless  had been there  you would not have been a
bit tired  and to say the truth it was not very pretty
of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited  

 invited   cried marianne 

 so my daughter middleton told me  for it seems sir
john met him somewhere in the street this morning  
marianne said no more  but looked exceedingly hurt 
impatient in this situation to be doing something
that might lead to her sister s relief  elinor resolved
to write the next morning to her mother  and hoped
by awakening her fears for the health of marianne 
to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed 
and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure
by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow  that marianne
was again writing to willoughby  for she could not suppose
it to be to any other person 

about the middle of the day  mrs  jennings went out by
herself on business  and elinor began her letter directly 
while marianne  too restless for employment  too anxious
for conversation  walked from one window to the other 
or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation 
elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother 
relating all that had passed  her suspicions of
willoughby s inconstancy  urging her by every plea
of duty and affection to demand from marianne an account
of her real situation with respect to him 

her letter was scarcely finished  when a rap
foretold a visitor  and colonel brandon was announced 
marianne  who had seen him from the window  and who hated
company of any kind  left the room before he entered it 
he looked more than usually grave  and though expressing
satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone  as if he
had somewhat in particular to tell her  sat for some
time without saying a word   elinor  persuaded that he
had some communication to make in which her sister
was concerned  impatiently expected its opening 
it was not the first time of her feeling the same kind
of conviction  for  more than once before  beginning with
the observation of  your sister looks unwell to day  
or  your sister seems out of spirits   he had appeared
on the point  either of disclosing  or of inquiring 
something particular about her   after a pause of several
minutes  their silence was broken  by his asking her
in a voice of some agitation  when he was to congratulate
her on the acquisition of a brother   elinor was not
prepared for such a question  and having no answer ready 
was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient 
of asking what he meant   he tried to smile as he replied 
 your sister s engagement to mr  willoughby is very generally
known  

 it cannot be generally known   returned elinor 
 for her own family do not know it  

he looked surprised and said   i beg your pardon 
i am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent  but i had not
supposed any secrecy intended  as they openly correspond 
and their marriage is universally talked of  

 how can that be  by whom can you have heard
it mentioned  

 by many  by some of whom you know nothing  by others
with whom you are most intimate  mrs  jennings  mrs  palmer 
and the middletons   but still i might not have believed it 
for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to
be convinced  it will always find something to support
its doubts  if i had not  when the servant let me in today 
accidentally seen a letter in his hand  directed to
mr  willoughby in your sister s writing   i came to inquire 
but i was convinced before i could ask the question 
is every thing finally settled   is it impossible to  
but i have no right  and i could have no chance of succeeding 
excuse me  miss dashwood   i believe i have been wrong
in saying so much  but i hardly know what to do  and on
your prudence i have the strongest dependence   tell me
that it is all absolutely resolved on  that any attempt 
that in short concealment  if concealment be possible 
is all that remains  

these words  which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal
of his love for her sister  affected her very much 
she was not immediately able to say anything  and even
when her spirits were recovered  she debated for a short
time  on the answer it would be most proper to give 
the real state of things between willoughby and her sister
was so little known to herself  that in endeavouring
to explain it  she might be as liable to say too much
as too little   yet as she was convinced that marianne s
affection for willoughby  could leave no hope of colonel
brandon s success  whatever the event of that affection
might be  and at the same time wished to shield her conduct
from censure  she thought it most prudent and kind 
after some consideration  to say more than she really knew
or believed   she acknowledged  therefore  that though
she had never been informed by themselves of the terms
on which they stood with each other  of their mutual
affection she had no doubt  and of their correspondence
she was not astonished to hear 

he listened to her with silent attention  and on
her ceasing to speak  rose directly from his seat 
and after saying in a voice of emotion   to your sister
i wish all imaginable happiness  to willoughby that he
may endeavour to deserve her    took leave  and went away 

elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this
conversation  to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on
other points  she was left  on the contrary  with a
melancholy impression of colonel brandon s unhappiness 
and was prevented even from wishing it removed 
by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it 



chapter 28


nothing occurred during the next three or four days 
to make elinor regret what she had done  in applying
to her mother  for willoughby neither came nor wrote 
they were engaged about the end of that time to attend
lady middleton to a party  from which mrs  jennings was
kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter 
and for this party  marianne  wholly dispirited 
careless of her appearance  and seeming equally indifferent
whether she went or staid  prepared  without one look
of hope or one expression of pleasure   she sat by the
drawing room fire after tea  till the moment of lady
middleton s arrival  without once stirring from her seat 
or altering her attitude  lost in her own thoughts 
and insensible of her sister s presence  and when at
last they were told that lady middleton waited for them
at the door  she started as if she had forgotten that
any one was expected 

they arrived in due time at the place of destination 
and as soon as the string of carriages before them
would allow  alighted  ascended the stairs  heard their
names announced from one landing place to another in an
audible voice  and entered a room splendidly lit up 
quite full of company  and insufferably hot   when they had
paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady
of the house  they were permitted to mingle in the crowd 
and take their share of the heat and inconvenience  to
which their arrival must necessarily add   after some time
spent in saying little or doing less  lady middleton sat
down to cassino  and as marianne was not in spirits for
moving about  she and elinor luckily succeeding to chairs 
placed themselves at no great distance from the table 

they had not remained in this manner long  before elinor
perceived willoughby  standing within a few yards
of them  in earnest conversation with a very fashionable
looking young woman   she soon caught his eye  and he
immediately bowed  but without attempting to speak to her 
or to approach marianne  though he could not but see her 
and then continued his discourse with the same lady 
elinor turned involuntarily to marianne  to see whether
it could be unobserved by her   at that moment she first
perceived him  and her whole countenance glowing with
sudden delight  she would have moved towards him instantly 
had not her sister caught hold of her 

 good heavens   she exclaimed   he is there  he
is there  oh  why does he not look at me  why cannot
i speak to him  

 pray  pray be composed   cried elinor   and do
not betray what you feel to every body present 
perhaps he has not observed you yet  

this however was more than she could believe herself 
and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond
the reach of marianne  it was beyond her wish   she sat
in an agony of impatience which affected every feature 

at last he turned round again  and regarded them both 
she started up  and pronouncing his name in a tone
of affection  held out her hand to him   he approached 
and addressing himself rather to elinor than marianne 
as if wishing to avoid her eye  and determined not to
observe her attitude  inquired in a hurried manner after
mrs  dashwood  and asked how long they had been in town 
elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address 
and was unable to say a word   but the feelings of her sister
were instantly expressed   her face was crimsoned over 
and she exclaimed  in a voice of the greatest emotion 
 good god  willoughby  what is the meaning of this 
have you not received my letters   will you not shake
hands with me  

he could not then avoid it  but her touch seemed
painful to him  and he held her hand only for a moment 
during all this time he was evidently struggling for composure 
elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression
becoming more tranquil   after a moment s pause  he spoke
with calmness 

 i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley
street last tuesday  and very much regretted that i was
not fortunate enough to find yourselves and mrs  jennings
at home   my card was not lost  i hope  

 but have you not received my notes   cried marianne
in the wildest anxiety    here is some mistake i am
sure  some dreadful mistake   what can be the meaning
of it   tell me  willoughby  for heaven s sake tell me 
what is the matter  

he made no reply  his complexion changed and all his
embarrassment returned  but as if  on catching the eye
of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking 
he felt the necessity of instant exertion  he recovered
himself again  and after saying   yes  i had the pleasure
of receiving the information of your arrival in town 
which you were so good as to send me   turned hastily away
with a slight bow and joined his friend 

marianne  now looking dreadfully white  and unable
to stand  sunk into her chair  and elinor  expecting every
moment to see her faint  tried to screen her from the
observation of others  while reviving her with lavender water 

 go to him  elinor   she cried  as soon as she
could speak   and force him to come to me   tell him
i must see him again  must speak to him instantly   
i cannot rest  i shall not have a moment s peace till this
is explained  some dreadful misapprehension or other   
oh go to him this moment  

 how can that be done  no  my dearest marianne 
you must wait   this is not the place for explanations 
wait only till tomorrow  

with difficulty however could she prevent her
from following him herself  and to persuade her to check
her agitation  to wait  at least  with the appearance
of composure  till she might speak to him with more privacy
and more effect  was impossible  for marianne continued
incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery
of her feelings  by exclamations of wretchedness 
in a short time elinor saw willoughby quit the room by the
door towards the staircase  and telling marianne that he
was gone  urged the impossibility of speaking to him again
that evening  as a fresh argument for her to be calm 
she instantly begged her sister would entreat lady
middleton to take them home  as she was too miserable
to stay a minute longer 

lady middleton  though in the middle of a rubber 
on being informed that marianne was unwell  was too
polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away 
and making over her cards to a friend  they departed
as soon the carriage could be found   scarcely a word
was spoken during their return to berkeley street 
marianne was in a silent agony  too much oppressed even
for tears  but as mrs  jennings was luckily not come home 
they could go directly to their own room  where hartshorn
restored her a little to herself   she was soon undressed
and in bed  and as she seemed desirous of being alone 
her sister then left her  and while she waited the return
of mrs  jennings  had leisure enough for thinking over
the past 

that some kind of engagement had subsisted
between willoughby and marianne she could not doubt 
and that willoughby was weary of it  seemed equally clear 
for however marianne might still feed her own wishes 
she could not attribute such behaviour to mistake
or misapprehension of any kind   nothing but a thorough
change of sentiment could account for it   her indignation
would have been still stronger than it was  had she
not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak
a consciousness of his own misconduct  and prevented
her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been
sporting with the affections of her sister from the first 
without any design that would bear investigation 
absence might have weakened his regard  and convenience
might have determined him to overcome it  but that such
a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself
to doubt 

as for marianne  on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting
must already have given her  and on those still more
severe which might await her in its probable consequence 
she could not reflect without the deepest concern 
her own situation gained in the comparison  for while she
could esteem edward as much as ever  however they might be
divided in future  her mind might be always supported 
but every circumstance that could embitter such an evil
seemed uniting to heighten the misery of marianne
in a final separation from willoughby  in an immediate
and irreconcilable rupture with him 



chapter 29


before the house maid had lit their fire the next day 
or the sun gained any power over a cold  gloomy morning
in january  marianne  only half dressed  was kneeling
against one of the window seats for the sake of all
the little light she could command from it  and writing
as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her 
in this situation  elinor  roused from sleep by her agitation
and sobs  first perceived her  and after observing her
for a few moments with silent anxiety  said  in a tone
of the most considerate gentleness 

 marianne  may i ask   

 no  elinor   she replied   ask nothing  you will
soon know all  

the sort of desperate calmness with which this was said 
lasted no longer than while she spoke  and was immediately
followed by a return of the same excessive affliction 
it was some minutes before she could go on with her letter 
and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her 
at intervals  to withhold her pen  were proofs enough of her
feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing
for the last time to willoughby 

elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention
in her power  and she would have tried to sooth and
tranquilize her still more  had not marianne entreated her 
with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability 
not to speak to her for the world   in such circumstances 
it was better for both that they should not be long together 
and the restless state of marianne s mind not only prevented
her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed 
but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place 
made her wander about the house till breakfast time  avoiding
the sight of every body 

at breakfast she neither ate  nor attempted to eat
any thing  and elinor s attention was then all employed 
not in urging her  not in pitying her  nor in appearing
to regard her  but in endeavouring to engage mrs  jenning s
notice entirely to herself 

as this was a favourite meal with mrs  jennings 
it lasted a considerable time  and they were just setting
themselves  after it  round the common working table  when a
letter was delivered to marianne  which she eagerly caught
from the servant  and  turning of a death like paleness 
instantly ran out of the room   elinor  who saw as plainly
by this  as if she had seen the direction  that it must
come from willoughby  felt immediately such a sickness
at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head 
and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it
impossible to escape mrs  jenning s notice   that good lady 
however  saw only that marianne had received a letter
from willoughby  which appeared to her a very good joke 
and which she treated accordingly  by hoping  with a laugh 
that she would find it to her liking   of elinor s distress 
she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted
for her rug  to see any thing at all  and calmly continuing
her talk  as soon as marianne disappeared  she said 

 upon my word  i never saw a young woman so
desperately in love in my life   my girls were nothing
to her  and yet they used to be foolish enough  but as
for miss marianne  she is quite an altered creature 
i hope  from the bottom of my heart  he won t keep her
waiting much longer  for it is quite grievous to see her
look so ill and forlorn   pray  when are they to be married  

elinor  though never less disposed to speak than at
that moment  obliged herself to answer such an attack
as this  and  therefore  trying to smile  replied   and have
you really  ma am  talked yourself into a persuasion
of my sister s being engaged to mr  willoughby   i thought
it had been only a joke  but so serious a question seems
to imply more  and i must beg  therefore  that you will not
deceive yourself any longer   i do assure you that nothing
would surprise me more than to hear of their being going
to be married  

 for shame  for shame  miss dashwood  how can you
talk so   don t we all know that it must be a match  that
they were over head and ears in love with each other from
the first moment they met   did not i see them together
in devonshire every day  and all day long  and did not i
know that your sister came to town with me on purpose
to buy wedding clothes   come  come  this won t do 
because you are so sly about it yourself  you think nobody
else has any senses  but it is no such thing  i can tell you 
for it has been known all over town this ever so long 
i tell every body of it and so does charlotte  

 indeed  ma am   said elinor  very seriously 
 you are mistaken   indeed  you are doing a very unkind thing
in spreading the report  and you will find that you have
though you will not believe me now  

mrs  jennings laughed again  but elinor had not
spirits to say more  and eager at all events to know
what willoughby had written  hurried away to their room 
where  on opening the door  she saw marianne stretched on
the bed  almost choked by grief  one letter in her hand 
and two or three others laying by her   elinor drew near 
but without saying a word  and seating herself on the bed 
took her hand  kissed her affectionately several times 
and then gave way to a burst of tears  which at first
was scarcely less violent than marianne s  the latter 
though unable to speak  seemed to feel all the tenderness
of this behaviour  and after some time thus spent in
joint affliction  she put all the letters into elinor s hands 
and then covering her face with her handkerchief 
almost screamed with agony   elinor  who knew that such grief 
shocking as it was to witness it  must have its course 
watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat
spent itself  and then turning eagerly to willoughby s letter 
read as follows 

                               bond street  january 
      my dear madam 

      i have just had the honour of receiving your
     letter  for which i beg to return my sincere
     acknowledgments   i am much concerned to find there
     was anything in my behaviour last night that did
     not meet your approbation  and though i am quite at
     a loss to discover in what point i could be so
     unfortunate as to offend you  i entreat your
     forgiveness of what i can assure you to have been
     perfectly unintentional   i shall never reflect on
     my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire
     without the most grateful pleasure  and flatter
     myself it will not be broken by any mistake or
     misapprehension of my actions   my esteem for your
     whole family is very sincere  but if i have been so
     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than
     i felt  or meant to express  i shall reproach myself
     for not having been more guarded in my professions
     of that esteem   that i should ever have meant more
     you will allow to be impossible  when you understand
     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere 
     and it will not be many weeks  i believe  before
     this engagement is fulfilled   it is with great
     regret that i obey your commands in returning the
     letters with which i have been honoured from you 
     and the lock of hair  which you so obligingly bestowed
     on me 

      i am  dear madam 
                your most obedient
                     humble servant 
                                         john willoughby  


with what indignation such a letter as this must
be read by miss dashwood  may be imagined   though aware 
before she began it  that it must bring a confession
of his inconstancy  and confirm their separation for ever 
she was not aware that such language could be suffered
to announce it  nor could she have supposed willoughby
capable of departing so far from the appearance of every
honourable and delicate feeling  so far from the common
decorum of a gentleman  as to send a letter so impudently
cruel  a letter which  instead of bringing with his desire
of a release any professions of regret  acknowledged no
breach of faith  denied all peculiar affection whatever  
a letter of which every line was an insult  and which
proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy 

she paused over it for some time with indignant
astonishment  then read it again and again  but every
perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man 
and so bitter were her feelings against him  that she
dared not trust herself to speak  lest she might wound
marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement 
not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an
escape from the worst and most irremediable of all
evils  a connection  for life  with an unprincipled man 
as a deliverance the most real  a blessing the most important 

in her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter 
on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it 
and probably  on the very different mind of a very different
person  who had no other connection whatever with the affair
than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed 
elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister 
forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread 
and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room 
that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door 
she went to the window to see who could be coming so
unreasonably early  she was all astonishment to perceive
mrs  jennings s chariot  which she knew had not been
ordered till one   determined not to quit marianne 
though hopeless of contributing  at present  to her ease 
she hurried away to excuse herself from attending
mrs  jennings  on account of her sister being indisposed 
mrs  jennings  with a thoroughly good humoured concern
for its cause  admitted the excuse most readily  and elinor 
after seeing her safe off  returned to marianne  whom she
found attempting to rise from the bed  and whom she reached
just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor 
faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food 
for it was many days since she had any appetite  and many
nights since she had really slept  and now  when her
mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense 
the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head 
a weakened stomach  and a general nervous faintness 
a glass of wine  which elinor procured for her directly 
made her more comfortable  and she was at last able to express
some sense of her kindness  by saying 

 poor elinor  how unhappy i make you  

 i only wish   replied her sister   there were
any thing i could do  which might be of comfort to you  

this  as every thing else would have been 
was too much for marianne  who could only exclaim 
in the anguish of her heart   oh  elinor  i am miserable 
indeed   before her voice was entirely lost in sobs 

elinor could no longer witness this torrent
of unresisted grief in silence 

 exert yourself  dear marianne   she cried 
 if you would not kill yourself and all who love you 
think of your mother  think of her misery while you suffer 
for her sake you must exert yourself  

 i cannot  i cannot   cried marianne   leave me 
leave me  if i distress you  leave me  hate me  forget me 
but do not torture me so   oh  how easy for those 
who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion   happy 
happy elinor  you cannot have an idea of what i suffer  

 do you call me happy  marianne   ah  if you knew   and
can you believe me to be so  while i see you so wretched  

 forgive me  forgive me   throwing her arms round
her sister s neck   i know you feel for me  i know what
a heart you have  but yet you are  you must be happy 
edward loves you  what  oh what  can do away such happiness
as that  

 many  many circumstances   said elinor  solemnly 

 no  no  no   cried marianne wildly   he loves you 
and only you   you can have no grief  

 i can have no pleasure while i see you in this state  

 and you will never see me otherwise   mine is
a misery which nothing can do away  

 you must not talk so  marianne   have you no
comforts  no friends   is your loss such as leaves
no opening for consolation   much as you suffer now 
think of what you would have suffered if the discovery
of his character had been delayed to a later period  
if your engagement had been carried on for months and months 
as it might have been  before he chose to put an end to it 
every additional day of unhappy confidence  on your side 
would have made the blow more dreadful  

 engagement   cried marianne   there has been
no engagement  

 no engagement  

 no  he is not so unworthy as you believe him 
he has broken no faith with me  

 but he told you that he loved you  

 yes  no  never absolutely   it was every day implied 
but never professedly declared   sometimes i thought it
had been  but it never was  

 yet you wrote to him    

 yes  could that be wrong after all that had passed   
but i cannot talk  

elinor said no more  and turning again to the three
letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity
than before  directly ran over the contents of all 
the first  which was what her sister had sent him
on their arrival in town  was to this effect 

                         berkeley street  january 

      how surprised you will be  willoughby  on
     receiving this  and i think you will feel something
     more than surprise  when you know that i am in town 
     an opportunity of coming hither  though with mrs 
     jennings  was a temptation we could not resist 
     i wish you may receive this in time to come here
     to night  but i will not depend on it   at any rate
     i shall expect you to morrow  for the present  adieu 

                                              m d  

her second note  which had been written on the morning
after the dance at the middletons   was in these words   

      i cannot express my disappointment in having
     missed you the day before yesterday  nor my astonishment
     at not having received any answer to a note which
     i sent you above a week ago   i have been expecting
     to hear from you  and still more to see you  every
     hour of the day   pray call again as soon as possible 
     and explain the reason of my having expected this
     in vain   you had better come earlier another time 
     because we are generally out by one   we were last
     night at lady middleton s  where there was a dance 
     i have been told that you were asked to be of the
     party   but could it be so   you must be very much
     altered indeed since we parted  if that could be
     the case  and you not there   but i will not suppose
     this possible  and i hope very soon to receive your
     personal assurance of its being otherwise 

                                             m d  

the contents of her last note to him were these   

      what am i to imagine  willoughby  by your
     behaviour last night   again i demand an explanation
     of it   i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure
     which our separation naturally produced  with the
     familiarity which our intimacy at barton appeared
     to me to justify   i was repulsed indeed  i have
     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse
     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than
     insulting  but though i have not yet been able to
     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour 
     i am perfectly ready to hear your justification of
     it   you have perhaps been misinformed  or purposely
     deceived  in something concerning me  which may have
     lowered me in your opinion   tell me what it is 
     explain the grounds on which you acted  and i shall
     be satisfied  in being able to satisfy you   it
     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill
     of you  but if i am to do it  if i am to learn that
     you are not what we have hitherto believed you  that
     your regard for us all was insincere  that your
     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive  let
     it be told as soon as possible   my feelings are at
     present in a state of dreadful indecision  i wish
     to acquit you  but certainty on either side will be
     ease to what i now suffer   if your sentiments are
     no longer what they were  you will return my notes 
     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession 

                                              m d  

that such letters  so full of affection and confidence 
could have been so answered  elinor  for willoughby s sake 
would have been unwilling to believe   but her condemnation
of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their
having been written at all  and she was silently grieving
over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited
proofs of tenderness  not warranted by anything preceding 
and most severely condemned by the event  when marianne 
perceiving that she had finished the letters  observed to
her that they contained nothing but what any one would
have written in the same situation 

 i felt myself   she added   to be as solemnly
engaged to him  as if the strictest legal covenant
had bound us to each other  

 i can believe it   said elinor   but unfortunately
he did not feel the same  

 he did feel the same  elinor  for weeks and weeks he
felt it   i know he did   whatever may have changed him now   and
nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done
it   i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish 
this lock of hair  which now he can so readily give up 
was begged of me with the most earnest supplication 
had you seen his look  his manner  had you heard his voice
at that moment   have you forgot the last evening of our
being together at barton   the morning that we parted
too   when he told me that it might be many weeks before
we met again  his distress  can i ever forget his distress  

for a moment or two she could say no more 
but when this emotion had passed away  she added 
in a firmer tone 

 elinor  i have been cruelly used  but not by willoughby  

 dearest marianne  who but himself   by whom can he
have been instigated  

 by all the world  rather than by his own heart 
i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance
leagued together to ruin me in his opinion  than believe
his nature capable of such cruelty   this woman of whom he
writes  whoever she be  or any one  in short  but your own
dear self  mama  and edward  may have been so barbarous
to bely me   beyond you three  is there a creature
in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil
than willoughby  whose heart i know so well  

elinor would not contend  and only replied 
 whoever may have been so detestably your enemy  let them
be cheated of their malignant triumph  my dear sister 
by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own
innocence and good intentions supports your spirits 
it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists
such malevolence  

 no  no   cried marianne   misery such as mine has
no pride   i care not who knows that i am wretched 
the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world 
elinor  elinor  they who suffer little may be proud and
independent as they like  may resist insult  or return
mortification  but i cannot   i must feel  i must be
wretched  and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness
of it that can  

 but for my mother s sake and mine   

 i would do more than for my own   but to appear
happy when i am so miserable  oh  who can require it  

again they were both silent   elinor was employed
in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window 
from the window to the fire  without knowing that she
received warmth from one  or discerning objects through
the other  and marianne  seated at the foot of the bed 
with her head leaning against one of its posts 
again took up willoughby s letter  and  after shuddering
over every sentence  exclaimed  

 it is too much  oh  willoughby  willoughby  could this
be yours   cruel  cruel  nothing can acquit you   elinor 
nothing can   whatever he might have heard against me  
ought he not to have suspended his belief  ought he not to
have told me of it  to have given me the power of clearing
myself   the lock of hair   repeating it from the letter  
which you so obligingly bestowed on me   that is unpardonable 
willoughby  where was your heart when you wrote those words 
oh  barbarously insolent   elinor  can he be justified  

 no  marianne  in no possible way  

 and yet this woman  who knows what her art may
have been   how long it may have been premeditated 
and how deeply contrived by her   who is she   who can
she be   whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and
attractive among his female acquaintance   oh  no one 
no one  he talked to me only of myself  

another pause ensued  marianne was greatly agitated 
and it ended thus 

 elinor  i must go home   i must go and comfort mama 
can not we be gone to morrow  

 to morrow  marianne  

 yes  why should i stay here  i came only for
willoughby s sake  and now who cares for me  who regards me  

 it would be impossible to go to morrow  we owe
mrs  jennings much more than civility  and civility of
the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that  

 well then  another day or two  perhaps  but i cannot
stay here long  i cannot stay to endure the questions
and remarks of all these people   the middletons and
palmers  how am i to bear their pity   the pity of such
a woman as lady middleton   oh  what would he say to that  

elinor advised her to lie down again  and for a
moment she did so  but no attitude could give her ease 
and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one
posture to another  till growing more and more hysterical 
her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all 
and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call
for assistance   some lavender drops  however  which she
was at length persuaded to take  were of use  and from
that time till mrs  jennings returned  she continued
on the bed quiet and motionless 



chapter 30


mrs  jennings came immediately to their room on her return 
and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered 
opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern 

 how do you do my dear    said she in a voice of great
compassion to marianne  who turned away her face without
attempting to answer 

 how is she  miss dashwood   poor thing  she looks very bad   
no wonder   ay  it is but too true   he is to be married
very soon  a good for nothing fellow   i have no patience
with him   mrs  taylor told me of it half an hour ago 
and she was told it by a particular friend of miss
grey herself  else i am sure i should not have believed it 
and i was almost ready to sink as it was   well  said i 
all i can say is  that if this be true  he has used
a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill  and i
wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out 
and so i shall always say  my dear  you may depend on it 
i have no notion of men s going on in this way  and if ever
i meet him again  i will give him such a dressing as he
has not had this many a day   but there is one comfort 
my dear miss marianne  he is not the only young man
in the world worth having  and with your pretty face
you will never want admirers   well  poor thing   i won t
disturb her any longer  for she had better have her cry
out at once and have done with   the parrys and sandersons
luckily are coming tonight you know  and that will amuse her  

she then went away  walking on tiptoe out of the room 
as if she supposed her young friend s affliction could
be increased by noise 

marianne  to the surprise of her sister 
determined on dining with them   elinor even advised
her against it   but  no  she would go down  she could
bear it very well  and the bustle about her would
be less    elinor  pleased to have her governed for a
moment by such a motive  though believing it hardly
possible that she could sit out the dinner  said no more 
and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could 
while marianne still remained on the bed  was ready
to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were
summoned to it 

when there  though looking most wretchedly 
she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected 
had she tried to speak  or had she been conscious of half
mrs  jennings s well meant but ill judged attentions
to her  this calmness could not have been maintained 
but not a syllable escaped her lips  and the abstraction
of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing
that was passing before her 

elinor  who did justice to mrs  jennings s kindness 
though its effusions were often distressing  and sometimes
almost ridiculous  made her those acknowledgments 
and returned her those civilities  which her sister could
not make or return for herself   their good friend saw
that marianne was unhappy  and felt that every thing
was due to her which might make her at all less so 
she treated her therefore  with all the indulgent fondness
of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of
its holidays   marianne was to have the best place by the fire 
was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house 
and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day 
had not elinor  in the sad countenance of her sister 
seen a check to all mirth  she could have been entertained
by mrs  jennings s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love 
by a variety of sweetmeats and olives  and a good fire 
as soon  however  as the consciousness of all this was
forced by continual repetition on marianne  she could
stay no longer   with a hasty exclamation of misery 
and a sign to her sister not to follow her  she directly got
up and hurried out of the room 

 poor soul   cried mrs  jennings  as soon as she was gone 
 how it grieves me to see her   and i declare if she is
not gone away without finishing her wine   and the dried
cherries too   lord  nothing seems to do her any good 
i am sure if i knew of any thing she would like  i would
send all over the town for it   well  it is the oddest
thing to me  that a man should use such a pretty girl
so ill   but when there is plenty of money on one side 
and next to none on the other  lord bless you  they care
no more about such things    

 the lady then  miss grey i think you called her  
is very rich  

 fifty thousand pounds  my dear   did you ever see
her  a smart  stylish girl they say  but not handsome 
i remember her aunt very well  biddy henshawe  she married
a very wealthy man   but the family are all rich together 
fifty thousand pounds  and by all accounts  it won t come
before it s wanted  for they say he is all to pieces 
no wonder  dashing about with his curricle and hunters 
well  it don t signify talking  but when a young man 
be who he will  comes and makes love to a pretty girl 
and promises marriage  he has no business to fly off
from his word only because he grows poor  and a richer
girl is ready to have him   why don t he  in such a case 
sell his horses  let his house  turn off his servants 
and make a thorough reform at once  i warrant you 
miss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters
came round   but that won t do now a days  nothing in the
way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of
this age  

 do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is 
is she said to be amiable  

 i never heard any harm of her  indeed i hardly ever
heard her mentioned  except that mrs  taylor did say
this morning  that one day miss walker hinted to her 
that she believed mr  and mrs  ellison would not be sorry
to have miss grey married  for she and mrs  ellison could
never agree    

 and who are the ellisons  

 her guardians  my dear   but now she is of age
and may choose for herself  and a pretty choice she has
made   what now   after pausing a moment   your poor sister
is gone to her own room  i suppose  to moan by herself 
is there nothing one can get to comfort her   poor dear 
it seems quite cruel to let her be alone   well  by and by we
shall have a few friends  and that will amuse her a little 
what shall we play at   she hates whist i know  but is there
no round game she cares for  

 dear ma am  this kindness is quite unnecessary 
marianne  i dare say  will not leave her room again
this evening   i shall persuade her if i can to go
early to bed  for i am sure she wants rest  

 aye  i believe that will be best for her   let her name
her own supper  and go to bed   lord  no wonder she has
been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two 
for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as
long as that   and so the letter that came today finished it 
poor soul   i am sure if i had had a notion of it 
i would not have joked her about it for all my money 
but then you know  how should i guess such a thing   i made
sure of its being nothing but a common love letter  and
you know young people like to be laughed at about them   lord 
how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they
hear it   if i had my senses about me i might have called
in conduit street in my way home  and told them of it 
but i shall see them tomorrow  

 it would be unnecessary i am sure  for you to caution
mrs  palmer and sir john against ever naming mr  willoughby 
or making the slightest allusion to what has passed 
before my sister   their own good nature must point out
to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing
about it when she is present  and the less that may ever
be said to myself on the subject  the more my feelings
will be spared  as you my dear madam will easily believe  

 oh  lord  yes  that i do indeed   it must be terrible
for you to hear it talked of  and as for your sister 
i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her
for the world   you saw i did not all dinner time 
no more would sir john  nor my daughters  for they are
all very thoughtful and considerate  especially if i
give them a hint  as i certainly will   for my part 
i think the less that is said about such things  the better 
the sooner  tis blown over and forgot   and what does
talking ever do you know  

 in this affair it can only do harm  more so
perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind  for it
has been attended by circumstances which  for the sake
of every one concerned in it  make it unfit to become
the public conversation   i must do this justice to
mr  willoughby  he has broken no positive engagement
with my sister  

 law  my dear   don t pretend to defend him 
no positive engagement indeed  after taking her all
over allenham house  and fixing on the very rooms they
were to live in hereafter  

elinor  for her sister s sake  could not press the
subject farther  and she hoped it was not required of her
for willoughby s  since  though marianne might lose much 
he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth 
after a short silence on both sides  mrs  jennings 
with all her natural hilarity  burst forth again 

 well  my dear   tis a true saying about an ill wind 
for it will be all the better for colonel brandon 
he will have her at last  aye  that he will   mind me 
now  if they an t married by mid summer   lord  how he ll
chuckle over this news   i hope he will come tonight 
it will be all to one a better match for your sister 
two thousand a year without debt or drawback  except
the little love child  indeed  aye  i had forgot her 
but she may be  prenticed out at a small cost  and then
what does it signify   delaford is a nice place  i can
tell you  exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place 
full of comforts and conveniences  quite shut in with great
garden walls that are covered with the best fruit trees
in the country  and such a mulberry tree in one corner 
lord  how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we
were there   then  there is a dove cote  some delightful
stew ponds  and a very pretty canal  and every thing 
in short  that one could wish for  and  moreover  it is
close to the church  and only a quarter of a mile from
the turnpike road  so  tis never dull  for if you only
go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house 
you may see all the carriages that pass along 
oh   tis a nice place   a butcher hard by in the village 
and the parsonage house within a stone s throw 
to my fancy  a thousand times prettier than barton park 
where they are forced to send three miles for their meat 
and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother 
well  i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can 
one shoulder of mutton  you know  drives another down 
if we can but put willoughby out of her head  

 ay  if we can do that  ma am   said elinor 
 we shall do very well with or without colonel brandon  
and then rising  she went away to join marianne 
whom she found  as she expected  in her own room  leaning 
in silent misery  over the small remains of a fire 
which  till elinor s entrance  had been her only light 

 you had better leave me   was all the notice
that her sister received from her 

 i will leave you   said elinor   if you will go
to bed   but this  from the momentary perverseness
of impatient suffering  she at first refused to do 
her sister s earnest  though gentle persuasion  however 
soon softened her to compliance  and elinor saw her
lay her aching head on the pillow  and as she hoped 
in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her 

in the drawing room  whither she then repaired 
she was soon joined by mrs  jennings  with a wine glass 
full of something  in her hand 

 my dear   said she  entering   i have just recollected
that i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the
house that ever was tasted  so i have brought a glass of it
for your sister   my poor husband  how fond he was of it 
whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout  he said
it did him more good than any thing else in the world 
do take it to your sister  

 dear ma am   replied elinor  smiling at the difference
of the complaints for which it was recommended   how good
you are   but i have just left marianne in bed  and  i hope 
almost asleep  and as i think nothing will be of so much
service to her as rest  if you will give me leave 
i will drink the wine myself  

mrs  jennings  though regretting that she had not been
five minutes earlier  was satisfied with the compromise 
and elinor  as she swallowed the chief of it  reflected 
that though its effects on a colicky gout were  at present 
of little importance to her  its healing powers 
on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried
on herself as on her sister 

colonel brandon came in while the party were at tea 
and by his manner of looking round the room for marianne 
elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected
nor wished to see her there  and  in short  that he
was already aware of what occasioned her absence 
mrs  jennings was not struck by the same thought 
for soon after his entrance  she walked across the room
to the tea table where elinor presided  and whispered  
 the colonel looks as grave as ever you see   he knows
nothing of it  do tell him  my dear  

he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her s 
and  with a look which perfectly assured her of his
good information  inquired after her sister 

 marianne is not well   said she    she has been
indisposed all day  and we have persuaded her to go to bed  

 perhaps  then   he hesitatingly replied   what i
heard this morning may be  there may be more truth in it
than i could believe possible at first  

 what did you hear  

 that a gentleman  whom i had reason to think  in short 
that a man  whom i knew to be engaged  but how shall i
tell you   if you know it already  as surely you must 
i may be spared  

 you mean   answered elinor  with forced calmness 
 mr  willoughby s marriage with miss grey   yes  we do
know it all   this seems to have been a day of general
elucidation  for this very morning first unfolded it to us 
mr  willoughby is unfathomable   where did you hear it  

 in a stationer s shop in pall mall  where i
had business   two ladies were waiting for their carriage 
and one of them was giving the other an account of the
intended match  in a voice so little attempting concealment 
that it was impossible for me not to hear all   the name
of willoughby  john willoughby  frequently repeated 
first caught my attention  and what followed was a positive
assertion that every thing was now finally settled
respecting his marriage with miss grey  it was no longer
to be a secret  it would take place even within a few weeks 
with many particulars of preparations and other matters 
one thing  especially  i remember  because it served
to identify the man still more   as soon as the ceremony
was over  they were to go to combe magna  his seat
in somersetshire   my astonishment   but it would be
impossible to describe what i felt   the communicative
lady i learnt  on inquiry  for i stayed in the shop
till they were gone  was a mrs  ellison  and that  as i
have been since informed  is the name of miss grey s guardian  

 it is   but have you likewise heard that miss grey
has fifty thousand pounds   in that  if in any thing 
we may find an explanation  

 it may be so  but willoughby is capable  at least
i think   he stopped a moment  then added in a voice
which seemed to distrust itself   and your sister  
how did she   

 her sufferings have been very severe   i have
only to hope that they may be proportionately short 
it has been  it is a most cruel affliction   till yesterday 
i believe  she never doubted his regard  and even now 
perhaps  but i am almost convinced that he never was
really attached to her   he has been very deceitful  and 
in some points  there seems a hardness of heart about him  

 ah   said colonel brandon   there is  indeed   but
your sister does not  i think you said so  she does
not consider quite as you do  

 you know her disposition  and may believe how eagerly
she would still justify him if she could  

he made no answer  and soon afterwards  by the removal
of the tea things  and the arrangement of the card parties 
the subject was necessarily dropped   mrs  jennings  who had
watched them with pleasure while they were talking  and who
expected to see the effect of miss dashwood s communication 
in such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon s side 
as might have become a man in the bloom of youth  of hope
and happiness  saw him  with amazement  remain the whole
evening more serious and thoughtful than usual 



chapter 31


from a night of more sleep than she had expected 
marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness
of misery in which she had closed her eyes 

elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk
of what she felt  and before breakfast was ready  they had
gone through the subject again and again  and with the same
steady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinor s side 
the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on
marianne s  as before   sometimes she could believe
willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself 
and at others  lost every consolation in the impossibility
of acquitting him   at one moment she was absolutely
indifferent to the observation of all the world  at another
she would seclude herself from it for ever  and at a third
could resist it with energy   in one thing  however 
she was uniform  when it came to the point  in avoiding 
where it was possible  the presence of mrs  jennings 
and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it 
her heart was hardened against the belief of mrs  jennings s
entering into her sorrows with any compassion 

 no  no  no  it cannot be   she cried 
 she cannot feel   her kindness is not sympathy 
her good nature is not tenderness   all that she wants
is gossip  and she only likes me now because i supply it  

elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice
to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others 
by the irritable refinement of her own mind  and the too
great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a
strong sensibility  and the graces of a polished manner 
like half the rest of the world  if more than half there
be that are clever and good  marianne  with excellent
abilities and an excellent disposition  was neither
reasonable nor candid   she expected from other people
the same opinions and feelings as her own  and she judged
of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions
on herself   thus a circumstance occurred  while the
sisters were together in their own room after breakfast 
which sunk the heart of mrs  jennings still lower
in her estimation  because  through her own weakness 
it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself 
though mrs  jennings was governed in it by an impulse
of the utmost goodwill 

with a letter in her outstretched hand  and countenance
gaily smiling  from the persuasion of bringing comfort 
she entered their room  saying 

 now  my dear  i bring you something that i am sure
will do you good  

marianne heard enough   in one moment her imagination
placed before her a letter from willoughby  full of tenderness
and contrition  explanatory of all that had passed  satisfactory 
convincing  and instantly followed by willoughby himself 
rushing eagerly into the room to inforce  at her feet 
by the eloquence of his eyes  the assurances of his letter 
the work of one moment was destroyed by the next 
the hand writing of her mother  never till then unwelcome 
was before her  and  in the acuteness of the disappointment
which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope 
she felt as if  till that instant  she had never suffered 

the cruelty of mrs  jennings no language  within
her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence 
could have expressed  and now she could reproach her
only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with
passionate violence  a reproach  however  so entirely
lost on its object  that after many expressions of pity 
she withdrew  still referring her to the letter of comfort 
but the letter  when she was calm enough to read it 
brought little comfort   willoughby filled every page 
her mother  still confident of their engagement  and relying
as warmly as ever on his constancy  had only been roused
by elinor s application  to intreat from marianne greater
openness towards them both  and this  with such tenderness
towards her  such affection for willoughby  and such
a conviction of their future happiness in each other 
that she wept with agony through the whole of it 

all her impatience to be at home again now returned 
her mother was dearer to her than ever  dearer through
the very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby 
and she was wildly urgent to be gone   elinor  unable herself
to determine whether it were better for marianne to be
in london or at barton  offered no counsel of her own
except of patience till their mother s wishes could be known 
and at length she obtained her sister s consent to wait
for that knowledge 

mrs  jennings left them earlier than usual  for she
could not be easy till the middletons and palmers were able
to grieve as much as herself  and positively refusing
elinor s offered attendance  went out alone for the rest
of the morning   elinor  with a very heavy heart  aware of
the pain she was going to communicate  and perceiving 
by marianne s letter  how ill she had succeeded in laying
any foundation for it  then sat down to write her mother
an account of what had passed  and entreat her directions
for the future  while marianne  who came into the drawing room
on mrs  jennings s going away  remained fixed at the table
where elinor wrote  watching the advancement of her pen 
grieving over her for the hardship of such a task 
and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother 

in this manner they had continued about a quarter
of an hour  when marianne  whose nerves could not then
bear any sudden noise  was startled by a rap at the door 

 who can this be   cried elinor    so early too  i
thought we had been safe  

marianne moved to the window  

 it is colonel brandon   said she  with vexation 
 we are never safe from him  

 he will not come in  as mrs  jennings is from home  

 i will not trust to that   retreating to her own room 
 a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no
conscience in his intrusion on that of others  

the event proved her conjecture right  though it
was founded on injustice and error  for colonel brandon
did come in  and elinor  who was convinced that
solicitude for marianne brought him thither  and who saw
that solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look 
and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her 
could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly 

 i met mrs  jennings in bond street   said he 
after the first salutation   and she encouraged me
to come on  and i was the more easily encouraged 
because i thought it probable that i might find you alone 
which i was very desirous of doing   my object  my
wish  my sole wish in desiring it  i hope  i believe
it is  is to be a means of giving comfort   no  i must
not say comfort  not present comfort  but conviction 
lasting conviction to your sister s mind   my regard for her 
for yourself  for your mother  will you allow me to prove it 
by relating some circumstances which nothing but a very
sincere regard  nothing but an earnest desire of being
useful  i think i am justified  though where so many hours
have been spent in convincing myself that i am right 
is there not some reason to fear i may be wrong  
he stopped 

 i understand you   said elinor    you have something
to tell me of mr  willoughby  that will open his character
farther   your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship
that can be shewn marianne   my gratitude will be insured
immediately by any information tending to that end  and hers
must be gained by it in time   pray  pray let me hear it  

 you shall  and  to be brief  when i quitted barton
last october   but this will give you no idea  i must go
farther back   you will find me a very awkward narrator 
miss dashwood  i hardly know where to begin   a short
account of myself  i believe  will be necessary  and it
shall be a short one   on such a subject   sighing heavily 
 can i have little temptation to be diffuse  

he stopt a moment for recollection  and then 
with another sigh  went on 

 you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation  
 it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression
on you   a conversation between us one evening at barton
park  it was the evening of a dance  in which i alluded
to a lady i had once known  as resembling  in some measure 
your sister marianne  

 indeed   answered elinor   i have not forgotten it  
he looked pleased by this remembrance  and added 

 if i am not deceived by the uncertainty  the partiality
of tender recollection  there is a very strong resemblance
between them  as well in mind as person   the same warmth
of heart  the same eagerness of fancy and spirits 
this lady was one of my nearest relations  an orphan from
her infancy  and under the guardianship of my father 
our ages were nearly the same  and from our earliest years
we were playfellows and friends   i cannot remember the
time when i did not love eliza  and my affection for her 
as we grew up  was such  as perhaps  judging from my
present forlorn and cheerless gravity  you might think me
incapable of having ever felt   her s  for me  was  i believe 
fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr  willoughby
and it was  though from a different cause  no less unfortunate 
at seventeen she was lost to me for ever   she was
married  married against her inclination to my brother 
her fortune was large  and our family estate much encumbered 
and this  i fear  is all that can be said for the
conduct of one  who was at once her uncle and guardian 
my brother did not deserve her  he did not even love her 
i had hoped that her regard for me would support her
under any difficulty  and for some time it did  but at
last the misery of her situation  for she experienced
great unkindness  overcame all her resolution  and though
she had promised me that nothing  but how blindly i
relate   i have never told you how this was brought on 
we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland 
the treachery  or the folly  of my cousin s maid betrayed us 
i was banished to the house of a relation far distant 
and she was allowed no liberty  no society  no amusement 
till my father s point was gained   i had depended on her
fortitude too far  and the blow was a severe one  
but had her marriage been happy  so young as i then was 
a few months must have reconciled me to it  or at least
i should not have now to lament it   this however
was not the case   my brother had no regard for her 
his pleasures were not what they ought to have been 
and from the first he treated her unkindly   the consequence
of this  upon a mind so young  so lively  so inexperienced
as mrs  brandon s  was but too natural   she resigned
herself at first to all the misery of her situation 
and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those
regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned   but can we
wonder that  with such a husband to provoke inconstancy 
and without a friend to advise or restrain her  for
my father lived only a few months after their marriage 
and i was with my regiment in the east indies  she
should fall   had i remained in england  perhaps  but i
meant to promote the happiness of both by removing
from her for years  and for that purpose had procured
my exchange   the shock which her marriage had given me  
he continued  in a voice of great agitation   was of
trifling weight  was nothing to what i felt when i heard 
about two years afterwards  of her divorce   it was
that which threw this gloom   even now the recollection
of what i suffered   

he could say no more  and rising hastily walked for a few
minutes about the room   elinor  affected by his relation 
and still more by his distress  could not speak   he saw
her concern  and coming to her  took her hand  pressed it 
and kissed it with grateful respect   a few minutes more
of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure 

 it was nearly three years after this unhappy
period before i returned to england   my first care 
when i did arrive  was of course to seek for her 
but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy 
i could not trace her beyond her first seducer  and there
was every reason to fear that she had removed from him
only to sink deeper in a life of sin   her legal allowance
was not adequate to her fortune  nor sufficient for her
comfortable maintenance  and i learnt from my brother that
the power of receiving it had been made over some months
before to another person   he imagined  and calmly could he
imagine it  that her extravagance  and consequent distress 
had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief 
at last  however  and after i had been six months in england 
i did find her   regard for a former servant of my own 
who had since fallen into misfortune  carried me to visit
him in a spunging house  where he was confined for debt 
and there  the same house  under a similar confinement 
was my unfortunate sister   so altered  so faded  worn
down by acute suffering of every kind  hardly could i
believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me 
to be the remains of the lovely  blooming  healthful girl 
on whom i had once doted   what i endured in so beholding
her  but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting
to describe it  i have pained you too much already 
that she was  to all appearance  in the last stage
of a consumption  was  yes  in such a situation it was
my greatest comfort   life could do nothing for her 
beyond giving time for a better preparation for death 
and that was given   i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings 
and under proper attendants  i visited her every day
during the rest of her short life  i was with her in her
last moments  

again he stopped to recover himself  and elinor
spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern 
at the fate of his unfortunate friend 

 your sister  i hope  cannot be offended   said he 
 by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my
poor disgraced relation   their fates  their fortunes 
cannot be the same  and had the natural sweet
disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind 
or a happier marriage  she might have been all that you
will live to see the other be   but to what does all this
lead   i seem to have been distressing you for nothing 
ah  miss dashwood  a subject such as this  untouched
for fourteen years  it is dangerous to handle it at all 
i will be more collected  more concise   she left to my care
her only child  a little girl  the offspring of her first
guilty connection  who was then about three years old 
she loved the child  and had always kept it with her 
it was a valued  a precious trust to me  and gladly
would i have discharged it in the strictest sense 
by watching over her education myself  had the nature
of our situations allowed it  but i had no family  no home 
and my little eliza was therefore placed at school 
i saw her there whenever i could  and after the death of my
brother   which happened about five years ago  and which
left to me the possession of the family property   she
visited me at delaford   i called her a distant relation 
but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected
of a much nearer connection with her   it is now three
years ago  she had just reached her fourteenth year  
that i removed her from school  to place her under the care
of a very respectable woman  residing in dorsetshire 
who had the charge of four or five other girls of about
the same time of life  and for two years i had every reason
to be pleased with her situation   but last february 
almost a twelvemonth back  she suddenly disappeared 
i had allowed her   imprudently  as it has since turned
out   at her earnest desire  to go to bath with one of
her young friends  who was attending her father there
for his health   i knew him to be a very good sort of man 
and i thought well of his daughter  better than she deserved 
for  with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy 
she would tell nothing  would give no clue  though she
certainly knew all   he  her father  a well meaning 
but not a quick sighted man  could really  i believe 
give no information  for he had been generally confined
to the house  while the girls were ranging over the town
and making what acquaintance they chose  and he tried
to convince me  as thoroughly as he was convinced himself 
of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business 
in short  i could learn nothing but that she was gone 
all the rest  for eight long months  was left to conjecture 
what i thought  what i feared  may be imagined  and what i
suffered too  

 good heavens   cried elinor   could it be  could
willoughby    

 the first news that reached me of her   he continued 
 came in a letter from herself  last october 
it was forwarded to me from delaford  and i received it
on the very morning of our intended party to whitwell 
and this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly 
which i am sure must at the time have appeared strange
to every body  and which i believe gave offence to some 
little did mr  willoughby imagine  i suppose  when his
looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party 
that i was called away to the relief of one whom he
had made poor and miserable  but had he known it 
what would it have availed   would he have been less
gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister   no 
he had already done that  which no man who can feel
for another would do   he had left the girl whose
youth and innocence he had seduced  in a situation of
the utmost distress  with no creditable home  no help 
no friends  ignorant of his address   he had left her 
promising to return  he neither returned  nor wrote 
nor relieved her  

 this is beyond every thing   exclaimed elinor 

 his character is now before you  expensive  dissipated 
and worse than both   knowing all this  as i have now
known it many weeks  guess what i must have felt on seeing
your sister as fond of him as ever  and on being assured
that she was to marry him  guess what i must have felt
for all your sakes   when i came to you last week and
found you alone  i came determined to know the truth 
though irresolute what to do when it was known 
my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then 
but now you will comprehend it   to suffer you all to be
so deceived  to see your sister  but what could i do 
i had no hope of interfering with success  and sometimes
i thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him 
but now  after such dishonorable usage  who can tell what
were his designs on her   whatever they may have been 
however  she may now  and hereafter doubtless will
turn with gratitude towards her own condition  when she
compares it with that of my poor eliza  when she considers
the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl 
and pictures her to herself  with an affection for him so strong 
still as strong as her own  and with a mind tormented
by self reproach  which must attend her through life 
surely this comparison must have its use with her 
she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing   they
proceed from no misconduct  and can bring no disgrace 
on the contrary  every friend must be made still more
her friend by them   concern for her unhappiness 
and respect for her fortitude under it  must strengthen
every attachment   use your own discretion  however 
in communicating to her what i have told you   you must
know best what will be its effect  but had i not seriously 
and from my heart believed it might be of service 
might lessen her regrets  i would not have suffered
myself to trouble you with this account of my family
afflictions  with a recital which may seem to have been
intended to raise myself at the expense of others  

elinor s thanks followed this speech with grateful
earnestness  attended too with the assurance of her
expecting material advantage to marianne  from the
communication of what had passed 

 i have been more pained   said she   by her
endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest  for it
irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction
of his unworthiness can do   now  though at first she
will suffer much  i am sure she will soon become easier 
have you   she continued  after a short silence 
 ever seen mr  willoughby since you left him at barton  

 yes   he replied gravely   once i have   one meeting
was unavoidable  

elinor  startled by his manner  looked at him anxiously 
saying 

 what  have you met him to   

 i could meet him no other way   eliza had confessed
to me  though most reluctantly  the name of her lover 
and when he returned to town  which was within a fortnight
after myself  we met by appointment  he to defend 
i to punish his conduct   we returned unwounded 
and the meeting  therefore  never got abroad  

elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this 
but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it 

 such   said colonel brandon  after a pause 
 has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother
and daughter  and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust  

 is she still in town  

 no  as soon as she recovered from her lying in 
for i found her near her delivery  i removed her and her
child into the country  and there she remains  

recollecting  soon afterwards  that he was probably
dividing elinor from her sister  he put an end to his visit 
receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments 
and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him 



chapter 32


when the particulars of this conversation were repeated
by miss dashwood to her sister  as they very soon were 
the effect on her was not entirely such as the former
had hoped to see   not that marianne appeared to distrust
the truth of any part of it  for she listened to it all
with the most steady and submissive attention  made neither
objection nor remark  attempted no vindication of willoughby 
and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to
be impossible   but though this behaviour assured elinor
that the conviction of this guilt was carried home to
her mind  though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it 
in her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called 
in her speaking to him  even voluntarily speaking 
with a kind of compassionate respect  and though she
saw her spirits less violently irritated than before 
she did not see her less wretched   her mind did become
settled  but it was settled in a gloomy dejection 
she felt the loss of willoughby s character yet more heavily
than she had felt the loss of his heart  his seduction and
desertion of miss williams  the misery of that poor girl 
and the doubt of what his designs might once have been
on herself  preyed altogether so much on her spirits 
that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt
even to elinor  and  brooding over her sorrows in silence 
gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated
by the most open and most frequent confession of them 

to give the feelings or the language of mrs  dashwood
on receiving and answering elinor s letter would be only
to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt
and said  of a disappointment hardly less painful than
marianne s  and an indignation even greater than elinor s 
long letters from her  quickly succeeding each other 
arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought 
to express her anxious solicitude for marianne  and entreat
she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune 
bad indeed must the nature of marianne s affliction be 
when her mother could talk of fortitude  mortifying
and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets 
which she could wish her not to indulge 

against the interest of her own individual comfort 
mrs  dashwood had determined that it would be better for
marianne to be any where  at that time  than at barton 
where every thing within her view would be bringing back
the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner 
by constantly placing willoughby before her  such as
she had always seen him there   she recommended it to
her daughters  therefore  by all means not to shorten their
visit to mrs  jennings  the length of which  though never
exactly fixed  had been expected by all to comprise at least
five or six weeks   a variety of occupations  of objects 
and of company  which could not be procured at barton 
would be inevitable there  and might yet  she hoped 
cheat marianne  at times  into some interest beyond herself 
and even into some amusement  much as the ideas of both
might now be spurned by her 

from all danger of seeing willoughby again 
her mother considered her to be at least equally safe
in town as in the country  since his acquaintance must
now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends 
design could never bring them in each other s way 
negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise 
and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london
than even in the retirement of barton  where it might
force him before her while paying that visit at allenham
on his marriage  which mrs  dashwood  from foreseeing at
first as a probable event  had brought herself to expect
as a certain one 

she had yet another reason for wishing her children
to remain where they were  a letter from her son in law
had told her that he and his wife were to be in town
before the middle of february  and she judged it right
that they should sometimes see their brother 

marianne had promised to be guided by her mother s opinion 
and she submitted to it therefore without opposition 
though it proved perfectly different from what she wished
and expected  though she felt it to be entirely wrong 
formed on mistaken grounds  and that by requiring her
longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only
possible alleviation of her wretchedness  the personal
sympathy of her mother  and doomed her to such society and
such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment s rest 

but it was a matter of great consolation to her 
that what brought evil to herself would bring good to
her sister  and elinor  on the other hand  suspecting that
it would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely 
comforted herself by thinking  that though their longer
stay would therefore militate against her own happiness 
it would be better for marianne than an immediate return
into devonshire 

her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever
hearing willoughby s name mentioned  was not thrown away 
marianne  though without knowing it herself  reaped all
its advantage  for neither mrs  jennings  nor sir john 
nor even mrs  palmer herself  ever spoke of him before her 
elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended
towards herself  but that was impossible  and she was
obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all 

sir john  could not have thought it possible 
 a man of whom he had always had such reason to think well 
such a good natured fellow   he did not believe there was a
bolder rider in england   it was an unaccountable business 
he wished him at the devil with all his heart   he would
not speak another word to him  meet him where he might 
for all the world   no  not if it were to be by the side
of barton covert  and they were kept watching for two
hours together   such a scoundrel of a fellow  such
a deceitful dog   it was only the last time they met
that he had offered him one of folly s puppies  and this
was the end of it  

mrs  palmer  in her way  was equally angry 
 she was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately 
and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted
with him at all   she wished with all her heart combe
magna was not so near cleveland  but it did not signify 
for it was a great deal too far off to visit  she hated
him so much that she was resolved never to mention
his name again  and she should tell everybody she saw 
how good for nothing he was  

the rest of mrs  palmer s sympathy was shewn in procuring
all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage 
and communicating them to elinor   she could soon tell
at what coachmaker s the new carriage was building 
by what painter mr  willoughby s portrait was drawn 
and at what warehouse miss grey s clothes might be seen 

the calm and polite unconcern of lady middleton
on the occasion was a happy relief to elinor s spirits 
oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness
of the others   it was a great comfort to her to be sure
of exciting no interest in one person at least among their
circle of friends  a great comfort to know that there
was one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity
after particulars  or any anxiety for her sister s health 

every qualification is raised at times  by the
circumstances of the moment  to more than its real value 
and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence
to rate good breeding as more indispensable to comfort
than good nature 

lady middleton expressed her sense of the affair
about once every day  or twice  if the subject occurred
very often  by saying   it is very shocking  indeed  
and by the means of this continual though gentle vent 
was able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the
first without the smallest emotion  but very soon
to see them without recollecting a word of the matter 
and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex 
and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong
in the other  she thought herself at liberty to attend
to the interest of her own assemblies  and therefore
determined  though rather against the opinion of sir john 
that as mrs  willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance
and fortune  to leave her card with her as soon as she married 

colonel brandon s delicate  unobtrusive enquiries
were never unwelcome to miss dashwood   he had abundantly
earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her
sister s disappointment  by the friendly zeal with
which he had endeavoured to soften it  and they always
conversed with confidence   his chief reward for the
painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present
humiliations  was given in the pitying eye with which
marianne sometimes observed him  and the gentleness
of her voice whenever  though it did not often happen 
she was obliged  or could oblige herself to speak to him 
these assured him that his exertion had produced an
increase of good will towards himself  and these gave
elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter 
but mrs  jennings  who knew nothing of all this  who knew
only that the colonel continued as grave as ever  and that
she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself 
nor commission her to make it for him  began  at the
end of two days  to think that  instead of midsummer 
they would not be married till michaelmas  and by the
end of a week that it would not be a match at all 
the good understanding between the colonel and miss
dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours
of the mulberry tree  the canal  and the yew arbour 
would all be made over to her  and mrs  jennings had 
for some time ceased to think at all of mrs  ferrars 

early in february  within a fortnight from the
receipt of willoughby s letter  elinor had the painful
office of informing her sister that he was married 
she had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed
to herself  as soon as it was known that the ceremony
was over  as she was desirous that marianne should not
receive the first notice of it from the public papers 
which she saw her eagerly examining every morning 

she received the news with resolute composure 
made no observation on it  and at first shed no tears 
but after a short time they would burst out  and for the
rest of the day  she was in a state hardly less pitiable
than when she first learnt to expect the event 

the willoughbys left town as soon as they were married 
and elinor now hoped  as there could be no danger
of her seeing either of them  to prevail on her sister 
who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell 
to go out again by degrees as she had done before 

about this time the two miss steeles  lately arrived
at their cousin s house in bartlett s buildings 
holburn  presented themselves again before their more
grand relations in conduit and berkeley streets 
and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality 

elinor only was sorry to see them   their presence
always gave her pain  and she hardly knew how to make
a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of lucy
in finding her still in town 

 i should have been quite disappointed if i had not
found you here still   said she repeatedly  with a strong
emphasis on the word    but i always thought i should 
i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile 
though you told me  you know  at barton  that you should
not stay above a month   but i thought  at the time 
that you would most likely change your mind when it came
to the point   it would have been such a great pity
to have went away before your brother and sister came 
and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone 
i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word  

elinor perfectly understood her  and was forced
to use all her self command to make it appear that she
did not 

 well  my dear   said mrs  jennings   and how did
you travel  

 not in the stage  i assure you   replied miss steele 
with quick exultation   we came post all the way  and had
a very smart beau to attend us   dr  davies was coming
to town  and so we thought we d join him in a post chaise 
and he behaved very genteelly  and paid ten or twelve
shillings more than we did  

 oh  oh   cried mrs  jennings   very pretty 
indeed  and the doctor is a single man  i warrant you  

 there now   said miss steele  affectedly simpering 
 everybody laughs at me so about the doctor  and i
cannot think why   my cousins say they are sure i have
made a conquest  but for my part i declare i never think
about him from one hour s end to another    lord  here
comes your beau  nancy   my cousin said t other day 
when she saw him crossing the street to the house 
my beau  indeed  said i  i cannot think who you mean 
the doctor is no beau of mine  

 aye  aye  that is very pretty talking  but it won t do  
the doctor is the man  i see  

 no  indeed   replied her cousin  with affected earnestness 
 and i beg you will contradict it  if you ever hear it talked
of  

mrs  jennings directly gave her the gratifying
assurance that she certainly would not  and miss steele
was made completely happy 

 i suppose you will go and stay with your brother
and sister  miss dashwood  when they come to town  
said lucy  returning  after a cessation of hostile hints 
to the charge 

 no  i do not think we shall  

 oh  yes  i dare say you will  

elinor would not humour her by farther opposition 

 what a charming thing it is that mrs  dashwood can
spare you both for so long a time together  

 long a time  indeed   interposed mrs  jennings 
 why  their visit is but just begun  

lucy was silenced 

 i am sorry we cannot see your sister  miss dashwood  
said miss steele    i am sorry she is not well   
for marianne had left the room on their arrival 

 you are very good   my sister will be equally
sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you  but she has
been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches 
which make her unfit for company or conversation  

 oh  dear  that is a great pity  but such old
friends as lucy and me   i think she might see us 
and i am sure we would not speak a word  

elinor  with great civility  declined the proposal 
her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed  or in her
dressing gown  and therefore not able to come to them 

 oh  if that s all   cried miss steele   we can
just as well go and see her  

elinor began to find this impertinence too much for
her temper  but she was saved the trouble of checking it 
by lucy s sharp reprimand  which now  as on many occasions 
though it did not give much sweetness to the manners
of one sister  was of advantage in governing those of
the other 



chapter 33


after some opposition  marianne yielded to her
sister s entreaties  and consented to go out with her
and mrs  jennings one morning for half an hour  she
expressly conditioned  however  for paying no visits 
and would do no more than accompany them to gray s in
sackville street  where elinor was carrying on a negotiation
for the exchange of a few old fashioned jewels of her mother 

when they stopped at the door  mrs  jennings recollected
that there was a lady at the other end of the street
on whom she ought to call  and as she had no business
at gray s  it was resolved  that while her young friends
transacted their s  she should pay her visit and
return for them 

on ascending the stairs  the miss dashwoods found
so many people before them in the room  that there was
not a person at liberty to tend to their orders  and they
were obliged to wait   all that could be done was  to sit
down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the
quickest succession  one gentleman only was standing there 
and it is probable that elinor was not without hope
of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch 
but the correctness of his eye  and the delicacy
of his taste  proved to be beyond his politeness 
he was giving orders for a toothpick case for himself 
and till its size  shape  and ornaments were determined 
all of which  after examining and debating for a quarter
of an hour over every toothpick case in the shop 
were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy  he had
no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies 
than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares 
a kind of notice which served to imprint on elinor
the remembrance of a person and face  of strong 
natural  sterling insignificance  though adorned in
the first style of fashion 

marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings
of contempt and resentment  on this impertinent examination
of their features  and on the puppyism of his manner
in deciding on all the different horrors of the different
toothpick cases presented to his inspection  by remaining
unconscious of it all  for she was as well able to collect
her thoughts within herself  and be as ignorant of what was
passing around her  in mr  gray s shop  as in her own bedroom 

at last the affair was decided   the ivory 
the gold  and the pearls  all received their appointment 
and the gentleman having named the last day on which his
existence could be continued without the possession of the
toothpick case  drew on his gloves with leisurely care 
and bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods  but such
a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration 
walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected
indifference 

elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward 
was on the point of concluding it  when another gentleman
presented himself at her side   she turned her eyes towards
his face  and found him with some surprise to be her brother 

their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough
to make a very creditable appearance in mr  gray s shop 
john dashwood was really far from being sorry to see
his sisters again  it rather gave them satisfaction 
and his inquiries after their mother were respectful
and attentive 

elinor found that he and fanny had been in town
two days 

 i wished very much to call upon you yesterday  
said he   but it was impossible  for we were obliged
to take harry to see the wild beasts at exeter exchange 
and we spent the rest of the day with mrs  ferrars 
harry was vastly pleased   this morning i had fully intended
to call on you  if i could possibly find a spare half hour 
but one has always so much to do on first coming to town 
i am come here to bespeak fanny a seal   but tomorrow i
think i shall certainly be able to call in berkeley street 
and be introduced to your friend mrs  jennings 
i understand she is a woman of very good fortune 
and the middletons too  you must introduce me to them 
as my mother in law s relations  i shall be happy to show
them every respect   they are excellent neighbours to you in
the country  i understand  

 excellent indeed   their attention to our comfort 
their friendliness in every particular  is more than i
can express  

 i am extremely glad to hear it  upon my word 
extremely glad indeed   but so it ought to be  they are
people of large fortune  they are related to you  and
every civility and accommodation that can serve to make
your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected 
and so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage
and want for nothing   edward brought us a most charming
account of the place  the most complete thing of its kind 
he said  that ever was  and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond
any thing   it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it 
i assure you  

elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother 
and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him 
by the arrival of mrs  jennings s servant  who came to tell
her that his mistress waited for them at the door 

mr  dashwood attended them down stairs  was introduced
to mrs  jennings at the door of her carriage  and repeating
his hope of being able to call on them the next day 
took leave 

his visit was duly paid   he came with a pretence at
an apology from their sister in law  for not coming too 
 but she was so much engaged with her mother  that really
she had no leisure for going any where    mrs  jennings 
however  assured him directly  that she should not stand
upon ceremony  for they were all cousins  or something
like it  and she should certainly wait on mrs  john
dashwood very soon  and bring her sisters to see her 
his manners to them  though calm  were perfectly kind 
to mrs  jennings  most attentively civil  and on colonel
brandon s coming in soon after himself  he eyed him with a
curiosity which seemed to say  that he only wanted to know
him to be rich  to be equally civil to him 

after staying with them half an hour  he asked
elinor to walk with him to conduit street  and introduce
him to sir john and lady middleton   the weather was
remarkably fine  and she readily consented   as soon
as they were out of the house  his enquiries began 

 who is colonel brandon   is he a man of fortune  

 yes  he has very good property in dorsetshire  

 i am glad of it   he seems a most gentlemanlike man 
and i think  elinor  i may congratulate you on the prospect
of a very respectable establishment in life  

 me  brother  what do you mean  

 he likes you   i observed him narrowly  and am
convinced of it   what is the amount of his fortune  

 i believe about two thousand a year  

 two thousand a year   and then working himself
up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity  he added 
 elinor  i wish with all my heart it were twice as much 
for your sake  

 indeed i believe you   replied elinor   but i am
very sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish
of marrying me  

 you are mistaken  elinor  you are very much mistaken 
a very little trouble on your side secures him 
perhaps just at present he may be undecided  the smallness
of your fortune may make him hang back  his friends
may all advise him against it   but some of those little
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily
give will fix him  in spite of himself   and there can be
no reason why you should not try for him   it is not to be
supposed that any prior attachment on your side  in short 
you know as to an attachment of that kind  it is quite
out of the question  the objections are insurmountable  
you have too much sense not to see all that   colonel brandon
must be the man  and no civility shall be wanting on
my part to make him pleased with you and your family 
it is a match that must give universal satisfaction 
in short  it is a kind of thing that   lowering his voice
to an important whisper   will be exceedingly welcome
to all parties   recollecting himself  however  he added 
 that is  i mean to say  your friends are all truly
anxious to see you well settled  fanny particularly 
for she has your interest very much at heart  i assure you 
and her mother too  mrs  ferrars  a very good natured woman 
i am sure it would give her great pleasure  she said as much
the other day  

elinor would not vouchsafe any answer 

 it would be something remarkable  now   he continued 
 something droll  if fanny should have a brother and i
a sister settling at the same time   and yet it is not
very unlikely  

 is mr  edward ferrars   said elinor  with resolution 
 going to be married  

 it is not actually settled  but there is such
a thing in agitation   he has a most excellent mother 
mrs  ferrars  with the utmost liberality  will come forward 
and settle on him a thousand a year  if the match
takes place   the lady is the hon  miss morton  only daughter
of the late lord morton  with thirty thousand pounds 
a very desirable connection on both sides  and i have not
a doubt of its taking place in time   a thousand a year
is a great deal for a mother to give away  to make over
for ever  but mrs  ferrars has a noble spirit   to give
you another instance of her liberality   the other day 
as soon as we came to town  aware that money could
not be very plenty with us just now  she put bank notes
into fanny s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds 
and extremely acceptable it is  for we must live at a great
expense while we are here  

he paused for her assent and compassion  and she
forced herself to say 

 your expenses both in town and country must certainly
be considerable  but your income is a large one  

 not so large  i dare say  as many people suppose 
i do not mean to complain  however  it is undoubtedly
a comfortable one  and i hope will in time be better 
the enclosure of norland common  now carrying on 
is a most serious drain   and then i have made a little
purchase within this half year  east kingham farm 
you must remember the place  where old gibson used to live 
the land was so very desirable for me in every respect 
so immediately adjoining my own property  that i felt it
my duty to buy it   i could not have answered it to my
conscience to let it fall into any other hands   a man must
pay for his convenience  and it has cost me a vast deal
of money  

 more than you think it really and intrinsically worth  

 why  i hope not that   i might have sold it again 
the next day  for more than i gave  but  with regard to the
purchase money  i might have been very unfortunate indeed 
for the stocks were at that time so low  that if i had not
happened to have the necessary sum in my banker s hands 
i must have sold out to very great loss  

elinor could only smile 

 other great and inevitable expenses too we have
had on first coming to norland   our respected father 
as you well know  bequeathed all the stanhill effects
that remained at norland  and very valuable they were 
to your mother   far be it from me to repine at his
doing so  he had an undoubted right to dispose of his
own property as he chose  but  in consequence of it 
we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen 
china   c  to supply the place of what was taken away 
you may guess  after all these expenses  how very far we
must be from being rich  and how acceptable mrs  ferrars s
kindness is  

 certainly   said elinor   and assisted by her liberality 
i hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances  

 another year or two may do much towards it  
he gravely replied   but however there is still a great
deal to be done   there is not a stone laid of fanny s
green house  and nothing but the plan of the flower garden
marked out  

 where is the green house to be  

 upon the knoll behind the house   the old
walnut trees are all come down to make room for it 
it will be a very fine object from many parts of the park 
and the flower garden will slope down just before it 
and be exceedingly pretty   we have cleared away all the old
thorns that grew in patches over the brow  

elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself 
and was very thankful that marianne was not present 
to share the provocation 

having now said enough to make his poverty clear 
and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear rings
for each of his sisters  in his next visit at gray s
his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn  and he began to
congratulate elinor on having such a friend as mrs  jennings 

 she seems a most valuable woman indeed  her house 
her style of living  all bespeak an exceeding good income 
and it is an acquaintance that has not only been
of great use to you hitherto  but in the end may prove
materially advantageous   her inviting you to town is
certainly a vast thing in your favour  and indeed  it
speaks altogether so great a regard for you  that in all
probability when she dies you will not be forgotten   
she must have a great deal to leave  

 nothing at all  i should rather suppose  for she has
only her jointure  which will descend to her children  

 but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to
her income   few people of common prudence will do that 
and whatever she saves  she will be able to dispose of  

 and do you not think it more likely that she
should leave it to her daughters  than to us  

 her daughters are both exceedingly well married 
and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her
remembering them farther   whereas  in my opinion  by her
taking so much notice of you  and treating you in this
kind of way  she has given you a sort of claim on her
future consideration  which a conscientious woman would
not disregard   nothing can be kinder than her behaviour 
and she can hardly do all this  without being aware
of the expectation it raises  

 but she raises none in those most concerned 
indeed  brother  your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity
carries you too far  

 why  to be sure   said he  seeming to recollect himself 
 people have little  have very little in their power 
but  my dear elinor  what is the matter with marianne   
she looks very unwell  has lost her colour  and is grown
quite thin   is she ill  

 she is not well  she has had a nervous complaint
on her for several weeks  

 i am sorry for that   at her time of life 
any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever 
her s has been a very short one   she was as handsome a girl
last september  as i ever saw  and as likely to attract
the man   there was something in her style of beauty 
to please them particularly   i remember fanny used to say
that she would marry sooner and better than you did 
not but what she is exceedingly fond of you  but so it
happened to strike her   she will be mistaken  however 
i question whether marianne now  will marry a man worth
more than five or six hundred a year  at the utmost 
and i am very much deceived if you do not do better 
dorsetshire   i know very little of dorsetshire  but  my dear
elinor  i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it 
and i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself
among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors  

elinor tried very seriously to convince him that
there was no likelihood of her marrying colonel brandon 
but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself
to be relinquished  and he was really resolved on seeking
an intimacy with that gentleman  and promoting the marriage
by every possible attention   he had just compunction
enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself 
to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should
do a great deal  and an offer from colonel brandon 
or a legacy from mrs  jennings  was the easiest means
of atoning for his own neglect 

they were lucky enough to find lady middleton
at home  and sir john came in before their visit ended 
abundance of civilities passed on all sides   sir john
was ready to like anybody  and though mr  dashwood did
not seem to know much about horses  he soon set him
down as a very good natured fellow  while lady middleton
saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his
acquaintance worth having  and mr  dashwood went away
delighted with both 

 i shall have a charming account to carry
to fanny   said he  as he walked back with his sister 
 lady middleton is really a most elegant woman   such
a woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know 
and mrs  jennings too  an exceedingly well behaved woman 
though not so elegant as her daughter   your sister need
not have any scruple even of visiting her  which  to say
the truth  has been a little the case  and very naturally 
for we only knew that mrs  jennings was the widow of a man
who had got all his money in a low way  and fanny and
mrs  ferrars were both strongly prepossessed  that neither
she nor her daughters were such kind of women as fanny
would like to associate with   but now i can carry her
a most satisfactory account of both  



chapter 34


mrs  john dashwood had so much confidence in her
husband s judgment  that she waited the very next day
both on mrs  jennings and her daughter  and her
confidence was rewarded by finding even the former 
even the woman with whom her sisters were staying 
by no means unworthy her notice  and as for lady middleton 
she found her one of the most charming women in the world 

lady middleton was equally pleased with mrs  dashwood 
there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides 
which mutually attracted them  and they sympathised
with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor 
and a general want of understanding 

the same manners  however  which recommended mrs  john
dashwood to the good opinion of lady middleton did not suit
the fancy of mrs  jennings  and to her she appeared nothing
more than a little proud looking woman of uncordial address 
who met her husband s sisters without any affection 
and almost without having anything to say to them 
for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street 
she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence 

elinor wanted very much to know  though she did
not chuse to ask  whether edward was then in town 
but nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily
to mention his name before her  till able to tell her
that his marriage with miss morton was resolved on 
or till her husband s expectations on colonel brandon
were answered  because she believed them still so very
much attached to each other  that they could not be too
sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion 
the intelligence however  which she would not give 
soon flowed from another quarter   lucy came very shortly
to claim elinor s compassion on being unable to see edward 
though he had arrived in town with mr  and mrs  dashwood 
he dared not come to bartlett s buildings for fear
of detection  and though their mutual impatience to meet 
was not to be told  they could do nothing at present
but write 

edward assured them himself of his being in town 
within a very short time  by twice calling in berkeley street 
twice was his card found on the table  when they returned
from their morning s engagements   elinor was pleased
that he had called  and still more pleased that she had
missed him 

the dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted
with the middletons  that  though not much in the habit
of giving anything  they determined to give them  
a dinner  and soon after their acquaintance began 
invited them to dine in harley street  where they had
taken a very good house for three months   their sisters
and mrs  jennings were invited likewise  and john dashwood
was careful to secure colonel brandon  who  always glad
to be where the miss dashwoods were  received his eager
civilities with some surprise  but much more pleasure 
they were to meet mrs  ferrars  but elinor could not learn
whether her sons were to be of the party   the expectation
of seeing her  however  was enough to make her interested
in the engagement  for though she could now meet edward s
mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised
to attend such an introduction  though she could now see
her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself 
her desire of being in company with mrs  ferrars 
her curiosity to know what she was like  was as lively as ever 

the interest with which she thus anticipated the
party  was soon afterwards increased  more powerfully
than pleasantly  by her hearing that the miss steeles
were also to be at it 

so well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton 
so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her 
that though lucy was certainly not so elegant  and her
sister not even genteel  she was as ready as sir john
to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street 
and it happened to be particularly convenient to the miss
steeles  as soon as the dashwoods  invitation was known 
that their visit should begin a few days before the party
took place 

their claims to the notice of mrs  john dashwood 
as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had
had the care of her brother  might not have done much 
however  towards procuring them seats at her table 
but as lady middleton s guests they must be welcome  and lucy 
who had long wanted to be personally known to the family 
to have a nearer view of their characters and her own
difficulties  and to have an opportunity of endeavouring
to please them  had seldom been happier in her life 
than she was on receiving mrs  john dashwood s card 

on elinor its effect was very different   she began
immediately to determine  that edward who lived with
his mother  must be asked as his mother was  to a party
given by his sister  and to see him for the first time 
after all that passed  in the company of lucy   she hardly
knew how she could bear it 

these apprehensions  perhaps  were not founded
entirely on reason  and certainly not at all on truth 
they were relieved however  not by her own recollection 
but by the good will of lucy  who believed herself to be
inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her
that edward certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday 
and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther
by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme
affection for herself  which he could not conceal when they
were together 

the important tuesday came that was to introduce
the two young ladies to this formidable mother in law 

 pity me  dear miss dashwood   said lucy  as they
walked up the stairs together  for the middletons arrived
so directly after mrs  jennings  that they all followed
the servant at the same time   there is nobody here but
you  that can feel for me   i declare i can hardly stand 
good gracious   in a moment i shall see the person that all
my happiness depends on  that is to be my mother    

elinor could have given her immediate relief
by suggesting the possibility of its being miss morton s mother 
rather than her own  whom they were about to behold 
but instead of doing that  she assured her  and with
great sincerity  that she did pity her  to the utter
amazement of lucy  who  though really uncomfortable herself 
hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor 

mrs  ferrars was a little  thin woman  upright 
even to formality  in her figure  and serious 
even to sourness  in her aspect   her complexion was sallow 
and her features small  without beauty  and naturally
without expression  but a lucky contraction of the brow
had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity 
by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature 
she was not a woman of many words  for  unlike people
in general  she proportioned them to the number of
her ideas  and of the few syllables that did escape her 
not one fell to the share of miss dashwood  whom she eyed
with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events 

elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour   
a few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly  but it
was not in mrs  ferrars  power to distress her by it now   
and the difference of her manners to the miss steeles 
a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more 
only amused her   she could not but smile to see the graciousness
of both mother and daughter towards the very person  
for lucy was particularly distinguished  whom of all others 
had they known as much as she did  they would have been most
anxious to mortify  while she herself  who had comparatively
no power to wound them  sat pointedly slighted by both 
but while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied 
she could not reflect on the mean spirited folly from
which it sprung  nor observe the studied attentions
with which the miss steeles courted its continuance 
without thoroughly despising them all four 

lucy was all exultation on being so honorably
distinguished  and miss steele wanted only to be teazed
about dr  davies to be perfectly happy 

the dinner was a grand one  the servants were numerous 
and every thing bespoke the mistress s inclination
for show  and the master s ability to support it 
in spite of the improvements and additions which were
making to the norland estate  and in spite of its owner
having once been within some thousand pounds of being
obliged to sell out at a loss  nothing gave any symptom
of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it   
no poverty of any kind  except of conversation  appeared  
but there  the deficiency was considerable   john dashwood
had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing 
and his wife had still less   but there was no peculiar
disgrace in this  for it was very much the case with
the chief of their visitors  who almost all laboured
under one or other of these disqualifications for being
agreeable  want of sense  either natural or improved  want
of elegance  want of spirits  or want of temper 

when the ladies withdrew to the drawing room
after dinner  this poverty was particularly evident 
for the gentlemen had supplied the discourse with some
variety  the variety of politics  inclosing land 
and breaking horses  but then it was all over  and one
subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in 
which was the comparative heights of harry dashwood 
and lady middleton s second son william  who were nearly
of the same age 

had both the children been there  the affair might
have been determined too easily by measuring them at once 
but as harry only was present  it was all conjectural
assertion on both sides  and every body had a right to
be equally positive in their opinion  and to repeat it
over and over again as often as they liked 

the parties stood thus 

the two mothers  though each really convinced that
her own son was the tallest  politely decided in favour
of the other 

the two grandmothers  with not less partiality 
but more sincerity  were equally earnest in support
of their own descendant 

lucy  who was hardly less anxious to please one parent
than the other  thought the boys were both remarkably tall
for their age  and could not conceive that there could
be the smallest difference in the world between them 
and miss steele  with yet greater address gave it 
as fast as she could  in favour of each 

elinor  having once delivered her opinion on
william s side  by which she offended mrs  ferrars and
fanny still more  did not see the necessity of enforcing
it by any farther assertion  and marianne  when called
on for her s  offended them all  by declaring that she
had no opinion to give  as she had never thought about it 

before her removing from norland  elinor had painted
a very pretty pair of screens for her sister in law 
which being now just mounted and brought home 
ornamented her present drawing room  and these screens 
catching the eye of john dashwood on his following
the other gentlemen into the room  were officiously
handed by him to colonel brandon for his admiration 

 these are done by my eldest sister   said he   and you 
as a man of taste  will  i dare say  be pleased with them 
i do not know whether you have ever happened to see any
of her performances before  but she is in general reckoned
to draw extremely well  

the colonel  though disclaiming all pretensions
to connoisseurship  warmly admired the screens  as he
would have done any thing painted by miss dashwood 
and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited 
they were handed round for general inspection 
mrs  ferrars  not aware of their being elinor s work 
particularly requested to look at them  and after they had
received gratifying testimony of lady middletons s approbation 
fanny presented them to her mother  considerately informing
her  at the same time  that they were done by miss dashwood 

 hum   said mrs  ferrars   very pretty    and without
regarding them at all  returned them to her daughter 

perhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother
had been quite rude enough   for  colouring a little 
she immediately said 

 they are very pretty  ma am  an t they   but then again 
the dread of having been too civil  too encouraging herself 
probably came over her  for she presently added 

 do you not think they are something in miss
morton s style of painting  ma am   she does paint most
delightfully   how beautifully her last landscape is done  

 beautifully indeed   but she does every thing well  

marianne could not bear this   she was already
greatly displeased with mrs  ferrars  and such ill timed
praise of another  at elinor s expense  though she
had not any notion of what was principally meant by it 
provoked her immediately to say with warmth 

 this is admiration of a very particular kind   
what is miss morton to us   who knows  or who cares 
for her   it is elinor of whom we think and speak  

and so saying  she took the screens out of her
sister in law s hands  to admire them herself as they
ought to be admired 

mrs  ferrars looked exceedingly angry  and drawing
herself up more stiffly than ever  pronounced in retort
this bitter philippic   miss morton is lord morton s daughter  

fanny looked very angry too  and her husband was
all in a fright at his sister s audacity   elinor was
much more hurt by marianne s warmth than she had been
by what produced it  but colonel brandon s eyes  as they
were fixed on marianne  declared that he noticed only
what was amiable in it  the affectionate heart which could
not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point 

marianne s feelings did not stop here   the cold
insolence of mrs  ferrars s general behaviour to her sister 
seemed  to her  to foretell such difficulties and distresses
to elinor  as her own wounded heart taught her to think
of with horror  and urged by a strong impulse of
affectionate sensibility  she moved after a moment 
to her sister s chair  and putting one arm round her neck 
and one cheek close to hers  said in a low  but eager 
voice 

 dear  dear elinor  don t mind them   don t let them
make you unhappy  

she could say no more  her spirits were quite overcome 
and hiding her face on elinor s shoulder  she burst
into tears   every body s attention was called  and almost
every body was concerned   colonel brandon rose up and went
to them without knowing what he did   mrs  jennings 
with a very intelligent  ah  poor dear   immediately gave
her her salts  and sir john felt so desperately enraged
against the author of this nervous distress  that he
instantly changed his seat to one close by lucy steele 
and gave her  in a whisper  a brief account of the whole
shocking affair 

in a few minutes  however  marianne was recovered
enough to put an end to the bustle  and sit down among
the rest  though her spirits retained the impression
of what had passed  the whole evening 

 poor marianne   said her brother to colonel brandon 
in a low voice  as soon as he could secure his attention   
 she has not such good health as her sister   she is very
nervous   she has not elinor s constitution   and one must
allow that there is something very trying to a young woman
who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions 
you would not think it perhaps  but marianne was remarkably
handsome a few months ago  quite as handsome as elinor   
now you see it is all gone  



chapter 35


elinor s curiosity to see mrs  ferrars was satisfied   
she had found in her every thing that could tend to make
a farther connection between the families undesirable   
she had seen enough of her pride  her meanness  and her
determined prejudice against herself  to comprehend all
the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement 
and retarded the marriage  of edward and herself  had he been
otherwise free   and she had seen almost enough to be thankful
for her own sake  that one greater obstacle preserved her
from suffering under any other of mrs  ferrars s creation 
preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice  or any
solicitude for her good opinion   or at least  if she did not
bring herself quite to rejoice in edward s being fettered
to lucy  she determined  that had lucy been more amiable 
she ought to have rejoiced 

she wondered that lucy s spirits could be so very much
elevated by the civility of mrs  ferrars   that her interest
and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make
the attention which seemed only paid her because she was
not elinor  appear a compliment to herself  or to allow
her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her 
because her real situation was unknown   but that it was so 
had not only been declared by lucy s eyes at the time 
but was declared over again the next morning more openly 
for at her particular desire  lady middleton set her down
in berkeley street on the chance of seeing elinor alone 
to tell her how happy she was 

the chance proved a lucky one  for a message from
mrs  palmer soon after she arrived  carried mrs  jennings away 

 my dear friend   cried lucy  as soon as they were
by themselves   i come to talk to you of my happiness 
could anything be so flattering as mrs  ferrars s way
of treating me yesterday   so exceeding affable as she
was   you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her   
but the very moment i was introduced  there was such an
affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say 
she had quite took a fancy to me   now was not it so   
you saw it all  and was not you quite struck with it  

 she was certainly very civil to you  

 civil   did you see nothing but only civility   
i saw a vast deal more   such kindness as fell to the share
of nobody but me   no pride  no hauteur  and your sister
just the same  all sweetness and affability  

elinor wished to talk of something else  but lucy still
pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness 
and elinor was obliged to go on   

 undoubtedly  if they had known your engagement  
said she   nothing could be more flattering than their
treatment of you   but as that was not the case   

 i guessed you would say so   replied lucy
quickly   but there was no reason in the world why
mrs  ferrars should seem to like me  if she did not 
and her liking me is every thing   you shan t talk me
out of my satisfaction   i am sure it will all end well 
and there will be no difficulties at all  to what i
used to think   mrs  ferrars is a charming woman 
and so is your sister   they are both delightful women 
indeed   i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable
mrs  dashwood was  

to this elinor had no answer to make  and did not
attempt any 

 are you ill  miss dashwood   you seem low  you
don t speak   sure you an t well  

 i never was in better health  

 i am glad of it with all my heart  but really you did
not look it   i should be sorry to have you ill  you  that have
been the greatest comfort to me in the world   heaven
knows what i should have done without your friendship    

elinor tried to make a civil answer  though doubting
her own success   but it seemed to satisfy lucy  for she
directly replied 

 indeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard
for me  and next to edward s love  it is the greatest
comfort i have   poor edward   but now there is one
good thing  we shall be able to meet  and meet pretty often 
for lady middleton s delighted with mrs  dashwood 
so we shall be a good deal in harley street  i dare say 
and edward spends half his time with his sister  besides 
lady middleton and mrs  ferrars will visit now   
and mrs  ferrars and your sister were both so good to say
more than once  they should always be glad to see me   
they are such charming women   i am sure if ever you
tell your sister what i think of her  you cannot speak
too high  

but elinor would not give her any encouragement
to hope that she should tell her sister   lucy continued 

 i am sure i should have seen it in a moment 
if mrs  ferrars had took a dislike to me   if she had only
made me a formal courtesy  for instance  without saying
a word  and never after had took any notice of me 
and never looked at me in a pleasant way  you know
what i mean  if i had been treated in that forbidding
sort of way  i should have gave it all up in despair 
i could not have stood it   for where she does dislike 
i know it is most violent  

elinor was prevented from making any reply to this
civil triumph  by the door s being thrown open  the servant s
announcing mr  ferrars  and edward s immediately walking in 

it was a very awkward moment  and the countenance of each
shewed that it was so   they all looked exceedingly foolish 
and edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk
out of the room again  as to advance farther into it 
the very circumstance  in its unpleasantest form 
which they would each have been most anxious to avoid 
had fallen on them   they were not only all three together 
but were together without the relief of any other person 
the ladies recovered themselves first   it was not lucy s
business to put herself forward  and the appearance of
secrecy must still be kept up   she could therefore only
look her tenderness  and after slightly addressing him 
said no more 

but elinor had more to do  and so anxious was she 
for his sake and her own  to do it well  that she
forced herself  after a moment s recollection 
to welcome him  with a look and manner that were almost easy 
and almost open  and another struggle  another effort still
improved them   she would not allow the presence of lucy 
nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself 
to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him 
and that she had very much regretted being from home 
when he called before in berkeley street   she would
not be frightened from paying him those attentions which 
as a friend and almost a relation  were his due  by the
observant eyes of lucy  though she soon perceived them
to be narrowly watching her 

her manners gave some re assurance to edward  and he
had courage enough to sit down  but his embarrassment still
exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion  which the case
rendered reasonable  though his sex might make it rare 
for his heart had not the indifference of lucy s  nor
could his conscience have quite the ease of elinor s 

lucy  with a demure and settled air  seemed determined
to make no contribution to the comfort of the others 
and would not say a word  and almost every thing that was
said  proceeded from elinor  who was obliged to volunteer
all the information about her mother s health  their coming
to town   c  which edward ought to have inquired about 
but never did 

her exertions did not stop here  for she soon
afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as
to determine  under pretence of fetching marianne 
to leave the others by themselves  and she really did it 
and that in the handsomest manner  for she loitered away
several minutes on the landing place  with the most
high minded fortitude  before she went to her sister 
when that was once done  however  it was time for the raptures
of edward to cease  for marianne s joy hurried her into
the drawing room immediately   her pleasure in seeing him
was like every other of her feelings  strong in itself 
and strongly spoken   she met him with a hand that would
be taken  and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister 

 dear edward   she cried   this is a moment of great
happiness   this would almost make amends for every thing  

edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved 
but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he
really felt   again they all sat down  and for a moment
or two all were silent  while marianne was looking with the
most speaking tenderness  sometimes at edward and sometimes
at elinor  regretting only that their delight in each
other should be checked by lucy s unwelcome presence 
edward was the first to speak  and it was to notice
marianne s altered looks  and express his fear of her
not finding london agree with her 

 oh  don t think of me   she replied with spirited
earnestness  though her eyes were filled with tears
as she spoke   don t think of my health   elinor is well 
you see   that must be enough for us both  

this remark was not calculated to make edward or
elinor more easy  nor to conciliate the good will of lucy 
who looked up at marianne with no very benignant expression 

 do you like london   said edward  willing to say
any thing that might introduce another subject 

 not at all   i expected much pleasure in it 
but i have found none   the sight of you  edward  is the
only comfort it has afforded  and thank heaven  you
are what you always were  

she paused  no one spoke 

 i think  elinor   she presently added   we must
employ edward to take care of us in our return to barton 
in a week or two  i suppose  we shall be going  and  i trust 
edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge  

poor edward muttered something  but what it was 
nobody knew  not even himself   but marianne  who saw
his agitation  and could easily trace it to whatever
cause best pleased herself  was perfectly satisfied 
and soon talked of something else 

 we spent such a day  edward  in harley street
yesterday   so dull  so wretchedly dull   but i have much
to say to you on that head  which cannot be said now  

and with this admirable discretion did she defer
the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more
disagreeable than ever  and of her being particularly
disgusted with his mother  till they were more in private 

 but why were you not there  edward   why did you
not come  

 i was engaged elsewhere  

 engaged   but what was that  when such friends
were to be met  

 perhaps  miss marianne   cried lucy  eager to take
some revenge on her   you think young men never stand
upon engagements  if they have no mind to keep them 
little as well as great  

elinor was very angry  but marianne seemed entirely
insensible of the sting  for she calmly replied 

 not so  indeed  for  seriously speaking  i am very
sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street 
and i really believe he has the most delicate conscience
in the world  the most scrupulous in performing
every engagement  however minute  and however it
may make against his interest or pleasure   he is the
most fearful of giving pain  of wounding expectation 
and the most incapable of being selfish  of any body
i ever saw   edward  it is so  and i will say it 
what  are you never to hear yourself praised   then you
must be no friend of mine  for those who will accept
of my love and esteem  must submit to my open commendation  

the nature of her commendation  in the present case 
however  happened to be particularly ill suited to the
feelings of two thirds of her auditors  and was so very
unexhilarating to edward  that he very soon got up to go away 

 going so soon   said marianne   my dear edward 
this must not be  

and drawing him a little aside  she whispered
her persuasion that lucy could not stay much longer 
but even this encouragement failed  for he would go 
and lucy  who would have outstaid him  had his visit lasted
two hours  soon afterwards went away 

 what can bring her here so often   said marianne 
on her leaving them    could not she see that we wanted
her gone   how teazing to edward  

 why so   we were all his friends  and lucy has been
the longest known to him of any   it is but natural
that he should like to see her as well as ourselves  

marianne looked at her steadily  and said   you know 
elinor  that this is a kind of talking which i cannot bear 
if you only hope to have your assertion contradicted 
as i must suppose to be the case  you ought to recollect
that i am the last person in the world to do it 
i cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances  that are
not really wanted  

she then left the room  and elinor dared not follow
her to say more  for bound as she was by her promise
of secrecy to lucy  she could give no information that
would convince marianne  and painful as the consequences
of her still continuing in an error might be  she was
obliged to submit to it   all that she could hope  was
that edward would not often expose her or himself to the
distress of hearing marianne s mistaken warmth  nor to the
repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended
their recent meeting  and this she had every reason to expect 



chapter 36


within a few days after this meeting  the newspapers
announced to the world  that the lady of thomas palmer 
esq  was safely delivered of a son and heir  a very
interesting and satisfactory paragraph  at least to all
those intimate connections who knew it before 

this event  highly important to mrs  jennings s happiness 
produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time 
and influenced  in a like degree  the engagements
of her young friends  for as she wished to be as much
as possible with charlotte  she went thither every morning
as soon as she was dressed  and did not return till late
in the evening  and the miss dashwoods  at the particular
request of the middletons  spent the whole of every day 
in every day in conduit street   for their own comfort
they would much rather have remained  at least all
the morning  in mrs  jennings s house  but it was not
a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody 
their hours were therefore made over to lady middleton
and the two miss steeles  by whom their company  in fact
was as little valued  as it was professedly sought 

they had too much sense to be desirable companions
to the former  and by the latter they were considered with
a jealous eye  as intruding on their ground  and sharing
the kindness which they wanted to monopolize   though nothing
could be more polite than lady middleton s behaviour to
elinor and marianne  she did not really like them at all 
because they neither flattered herself nor her children 
she could not believe them good natured  and because they
were fond of reading  she fancied them satirical  perhaps
without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical 
but that did not signify   it was censure in common use 
and easily given 

their presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy 
it checked the idleness of one  and the business of the other 
lady middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them 
and the flattery which lucy was proud to think of
and administer at other times  she feared they would despise
her for offering   miss steele was the least discomposed
of the three  by their presence  and it was in their power
to reconcile her to it entirely   would either of them
only have given her a full and minute account of the whole
affair between marianne and mr  willoughby  she would
have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice
of the best place by the fire after dinner  which their
arrival occasioned   but this conciliation was not granted 
for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her
sister to elinor  and more than once dropt a reflection
on the inconstancy of beaux before marianne  no effect
was produced  but a look of indifference from the former 
or of disgust in the latter   an effort even yet lighter
might have made her their friend   would they only have
laughed at her about the doctor   but so little were they 
anymore than the others  inclined to oblige her 
that if sir john dined from home  she might spend a whole
day without hearing any other raillery on the subject 
than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself 

all these jealousies and discontents  however  were so
totally unsuspected by mrs  jennings  that she thought
it a delightful thing for the girls to be together 
and generally congratulated her young friends every night 
on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long 
she joined them sometimes at sir john s  sometimes
at her own house  but wherever it was  she always came
in excellent spirits  full of delight and importance 
attributing charlotte s well doing to her own care  and ready
to give so exact  so minute a detail of her situation 
as only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire 
one thing did disturb her  and of that she made her
daily complaint   mr  palmer maintained the common 
but unfatherly opinion among his sex  of all infants being alike 
and though she could plainly perceive  at different times 
the most striking resemblance between this baby and every
one of his relations on both sides  there was no convincing
his father of it  no persuading him to believe that it
was not exactly like every other baby of the same age 
nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple
proposition of its being the finest child in the world 

i come now to the relation of a misfortune 
which about this time befell mrs  john dashwood 
it so happened that while her two sisters with
mrs  jennings were first calling on her in harley street 
another of her acquaintance had dropt in  a circumstance
in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her 
but while the imaginations of other people will carry
them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct 
and to decide on it by slight appearances  one s happiness
must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance 
in the present instance  this last arrived lady allowed
her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability 
that on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods 
and understanding them to be mr  dashwood s sisters 
she immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street 
and this misconstruction produced within a day
or two afterwards  cards of invitation for them
as well as for their brother and sister  to a small
musical party at her house   the consequence of which was 
that mrs  john dashwood was obliged to submit not only
to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her
carriage for the miss dashwoods  but  what was still worse 
must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing
to treat them with attention  and who could tell that they
might not expect to go out with her a second time   the power
of disappointing them  it was true  must always be her s 
but that was not enough  for when people are determined
on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong  they feel
injured by the expectation of any thing better from them 

marianne had now been brought by degrees  so much
into the habit of going out every day  that it was become
a matter of indifference to her  whether she went or not 
and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every
evening s engagement  though without expecting the smallest
amusement from any  and very often without knowing 
till the last moment  where it was to take her 

to her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly
indifferent  as not to bestow half the consideration on it 
during the whole of her toilet  which it received from
miss steele in the first five minutes of their being
together  when it was finished   nothing escaped her minute
observation and general curiosity  she saw every thing 
and asked every thing  was never easy till she knew the price
of every part of marianne s dress  could have guessed the
number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than
marianne herself  and was not without hopes of finding out
before they parted  how much her washing cost per week 
and how much she had every year to spend upon herself 
the impertinence of these kind of scrutinies  moreover 
was generally concluded with a compliment  which
though meant as its douceur  was considered by marianne
as the greatest impertinence of all  for after undergoing
an examination into the value and make of her gown 
the colour of her shoes  and the arrangement of her hair 
she was almost sure of being told that upon  her word
she looked vastly smart  and she dared to say she would
make a great many conquests  

with such encouragement as this  was she dismissed
on the present occasion  to her brother s carriage 
which they were ready to enter five minutes after it
stopped at the door  a punctuality not very agreeable
to their sister in law  who had preceded them to the house
of her acquaintance  and was there hoping for some delay
on their part that might inconvenience either herself
or her coachman 

the events of this evening were not very remarkable 
the party  like other musical parties  comprehended a
great many people who had real taste for the performance 
and a great many more who had none at all  and the performers
themselves were  as usual  in their own estimation 
and that of their immediate friends  the first private
performers in england 

as elinor was neither musical  nor affecting to be so 
she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand
pianoforte  whenever it suited her  and unrestrained even
by the presence of a harp  and violoncello  would fix
them at pleasure on any other object in the room   in one
of these excursive glances she perceived among a group
of young men  the very he  who had given them a lecture
on toothpick cases at gray s   she perceived him soon
afterwards looking at herself  and speaking familiarly
to her brother  and had just determined to find out his
name from the latter  when they both came towards her 
and mr  dashwood introduced him to her as mr  robert ferrars 

he addressed her with easy civility  and twisted
his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as
words could have done  that he was exactly the coxcomb
she had heard him described to be by lucy   happy had
it been for her  if her regard for edward had depended
less on his own merit  than on the merit of his nearest
relations   for then his brother s bow must have given
the finishing stroke to what the ill humour of his mother
and sister would have begun   but while she wondered
at the difference of the two young men  she did not find
that the emptiness of conceit of the one  put her out
of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other 
why they were different  robert exclaimed to her himself
in the course of a quarter of an hour s conversation 
for  talking of his brother  and lamenting the extreme
gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing
in proper society  he candidly and generously attributed it
much less to any natural deficiency  than to the misfortune
of a private education  while he himself  though probably
without any particular  any material superiority
by nature  merely from the advantage of a public school 
was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man 

 upon my soul   he added   i believe it is nothing more 
and so i often tell my mother  when she is grieving
about it    my dear madam   i always say to her   you must
make yourself easy   the evil is now irremediable 
and it has been entirely your own doing   why would
you be persuaded by my uncle  sir robert  against your
own judgment  to place edward under private tuition 
at the most critical time of his life   if you had only sent
him to westminster as well as myself  instead of sending
him to mr  pratt s  all this would have been prevented  
this is the way in which i always consider the matter 
and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error  

elinor would not oppose his opinion  because 
whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage
of a public school  she could not think of edward s
abode in mr  pratt s family  with any satisfaction 

 you reside in devonshire  i think    was his
next observation   in a cottage near dawlish  

elinor set him right as to its situation 
and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody
could live in devonshire  without living near dawlish 
he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their
species of house 

 for my own part   said he   i am excessively fond
of a cottage  there is always so much comfort  so much
elegance about them   and i protest  if i had any money
to spare  i should buy a little land and build one myself 
within a short distance of london  where i might drive
myself down at any time  and collect a few friends
about me  and be happy   i advise every body who is going
to build  to build a cottage   my friend lord courtland
came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice 
and laid before me three different plans of bonomi s 
i was to decide on the best of them    my dear courtland  
said i  immediately throwing them all into the fire   do not
adopt either of them  but by all means build a cottage  
and that i fancy  will be the end of it 

 some people imagine that there can be no accommodations 
no space in a cottage  but this is all a mistake 
i was last month at my friend elliott s  near dartford 
lady elliott wished to give a dance    but how can it
be done   said she   my dear ferrars  do tell me how it
is to be managed   there is not a room in this cottage
that will hold ten couple  and where can the supper be  
i immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it 
so i said   my dear lady elliott  do not be uneasy 
the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease 
card tables may be placed in the drawing room  the library
may be open for tea and other refreshments  and let the
supper be set out in the saloon    lady elliott was delighted
with the thought   we measured the dining room  and found
it would hold exactly eighteen couple  and the affair
was arranged precisely after my plan   so that  in fact 
you see  if people do but know how to set about it 
every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage
as in the most spacious dwelling  

elinor agreed to it all  for she did not think
he deserved the compliment of rational opposition 

as john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his
eldest sister  his mind was equally at liberty to fix on
any thing else  and a thought struck him during the evening 
which he communicated to his wife  for her approbation 
when they got home   the consideration of mrs  dennison s
mistake 
in supposing his sisters their guests  had suggested the
propriety of their being really invited to become such 
while mrs  jenning s engagements kept her from home 
the expense would be nothing  the inconvenience not more 
and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy
of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its
complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father 
fanny was startled at the proposal 

 i do not see how it can be done   said she 
 without affronting lady middleton  for they spend every day
with her  otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it 
you know i am always ready to pay them any attention
in my power  as my taking them out this evening shews 
but they are lady middleton s visitors   how can i ask them
away from her  

her husband  but with great humility  did not see
the force of her objection    they had already spent a week
in this manner in conduit street  and lady middleton
could not be displeased at their giving the same number
of days to such near relations  

fanny paused a moment  and then  with fresh vigor  said 

 my love i would ask them with all my heart  if it
was in my power   but i had just settled within myself
to ask the miss steeles to spend a few days with us 
they are very well behaved  good kind of girls  and i think
the attention is due to them  as their uncle did so very
well by edward   we can ask your sisters some other year 
you know  but the miss steeles may not be in town any more 
i am sure you will like them  indeed  you do like them 
you know  very much already  and so does my mother  and they
are such favourites with harry  

mr  dashwood was convinced   he saw the necessity
of inviting the miss steeles immediately  and his conscience
was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters
another year  at the same time  however  slyly suspecting
that another year would make the invitation needless 
by bringing elinor to town as colonel brandon s wife 
and marianne as their visitor 

fanny  rejoicing in her escape  and proud of the ready
wit that had procured it  wrote the next morning to lucy 
to request her company and her sister s  for some days 
in harley street  as soon as lady middleton could spare them 
this was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy 
mrs  dashwood seemed actually working for her  herself 
cherishing all her hopes  and promoting all her views 
such an opportunity of being with edward and his family was 
above all things  the most material to her interest 
and such an invitation the most gratifying to her
feelings   it was an advantage that could not be too
gratefully acknowledged  nor too speedily made use of 
and the visit to lady middleton  which had not before had
any precise limits  was instantly discovered to have been
always meant to end in two days  time 

when the note was shown to elinor  as it was within ten
minutes after its arrival  it gave her  for the first time 
some share in the expectations of lucy  for such a mark
of uncommon kindness  vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance 
seemed to declare that the good will towards her arose
from something more than merely malice against herself 
and might be brought  by time and address  to do
every thing that lucy wished   her flattery had already
subdued the pride of lady middleton  and made an entry
into the close heart of mrs  john dashwood  and these
were effects that laid open the probability of greater 

the miss steeles removed to harley street  and all
that reached elinor of their influence there  strengthened
her expectation of the event   sir john  who called on
them more than once  brought home such accounts of the
favour they were in  as must be universally striking 
mrs  dashwood had never been so much pleased with any
young women in her life  as she was with them  had given
each of them a needle book made by some emigrant 
called lucy by her christian name  and did not know
whether she should ever be able to part with them 





 at this point in the first and second edtions  volume ii ended  




chapter 37


mrs  palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight 
that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up
the whole of her time to her  and  contenting herself with
visiting her once or twice a day  returned from that period
to her own home  and her own habits  in which she found
the miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share 

about the third or fourth morning after their
being thus resettled in berkeley street  mrs  jennings 
on returning from her ordinary visit to mrs  palmer 
entered the drawing room  where elinor was sitting
by herself  with an air of such hurrying importance
as prepared her to hear something wonderful  and giving her
time only to form that idea  began directly to justify it 
by saying 

 lord  my dear miss dashwood  have you heard the news  

 no  ma am   what is it  

 something so strange   but you shall hear it all   
when i got to mr  palmer s  i found charlotte quite
in a fuss about the child   she was sure it was very
ill  it cried  and fretted  and was all over pimples 
so i looked at it directly  and   lord  my dear  
says i   it is nothing in the world  but the red gum   
and nurse said just the same   but charlotte  she would
not be satisfied  so mr  donavan was sent for  and luckily
he happened to just come in from harley street  so he
stepped over directly  and as soon as ever he saw the child 
be said just as we did  that it was nothing in the world
but the red gum  and then charlotte was easy   and so 
just as he was going away again  it came into my head 
i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it 
but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news 
so upon that  he smirked  and simpered  and looked grave 
and seemed to know something or other  and at last he
said in a whisper   for fear any unpleasant report
should reach the young ladies under your care as to their
sister s indisposition  i think it advisable to say 
that i believe there is no great reason for alarm  i hope
mrs  dashwood will do very well   

 what  is fanny ill  

 that is exactly what i said  my dear    lord   says i 
 is mrs  dashwood ill   so then it all came out  and the
long and the short of the matter  by all i can learn 
seems to be this   mr  edward ferrars  the very young
man i used to joke with you about  but however  as it
turns out  i am monstrous glad there was never any thing
in it   mr  edward ferrars  it seems  has been engaged
above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy   there s for you 
my dear   and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter 
except nancy   could you have believed such a thing possible   
there is no great wonder in their liking one another 
but that matters should be brought so forward between them 
and nobody suspect it   that is strange   i never happened
to see them together  or i am sure i should have found it
out directly   well  and so this was kept a great secret 
for fear of mrs  ferrars  and neither she nor your
brother or sister suspected a word of the matter   
till this very morning  poor nancy  who  you know  is a
well meaning creature  but no conjurer  popt it all out 
 lord   thinks she to herself   they are all so fond
of lucy  to be sure they will make no difficulty about it  
and so  away she went to your sister  who was sitting all
alone at her carpet work  little suspecting what was to
come  for she had just been saying to your brother  only five
minutes before  that she thought to make a match between
edward and some lord s daughter or other  i forget who 
so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity
and pride   she fell into violent hysterics immediately 
with such screams as reached your brother s ears 
as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs 
thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country 
so up he flew directly  and a terrible scene took place 
for lucy was come to them by that time  little dreaming
what was going on   poor soul   i pity her   and i must say 
i think she was used very hardly  for your sister scolded
like any fury  and soon drove her into a fainting fit 
nancy  she fell upon her knees  and cried bitterly 
and your brother  he walked about the room  and said
he did not know what to do   mrs  dashwood declared
they should not stay a minute longer in the house 
and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too 
to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed
up their clothes   then she fell into hysterics again 
and he was so frightened that he would send for mr  donavan 
and mr  donavan found the house in all this uproar 
the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor
cousins away  and they were just stepping in as he
came off  poor lucy in such a condition  he says 
she could hardly walk  and nancy  she was almost as bad 
i declare  i have no patience with your sister  and i hope 
with all my heart  it will be a match in spite of her 
lord  what a taking poor mr  edward will be in when he
hears of it   to have his love used so scornfully  for
they say he is monstrous fond of her  as well he may 
i should not wonder  if he was to be in the greatest
passion   and mr  donavan thinks just the same   he and i
had a great deal of talk about it  and the best of all is 
that he is gone back again to harley street  that he may
be within call when mrs  ferrars is told of it  for she
was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house 
for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too 
and so she may  for what i care   i have no pity for
either of them   i have no notion of people s making
such a to do about money and greatness   there is no
reason on earth why mr  edward and lucy should not marry 
for i am sure mrs  ferrars may afford to do very well
by her son  and though lucy has next to nothing herself 
she knows better than any body how to make the most
of every thing  i dare say  if mrs  ferrars would only
allow him five hundred a year  she would make as good
an appearance with it as any body else would with eight 
lord  how snug they might live in such another cottage
as yours  or a little bigger  with two maids  and two men 
and i believe i could help them to a housemaid  for my
betty has a sister out of place  that would fit them
exactly  

here mrs  jennings ceased  and as elinor had had
time enough to collect her thoughts  she was able
to give such an answer  and make such observations 
as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce 
happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary
interest in it  that mrs  jennings  as she had of late
often hoped might be the case  had ceased to imagine her
at all attached to edward  and happy above all the rest 
in the absence of marianne  she felt very well able
to speak of the affair without embarrassment  and to
give her judgment  as she believed  with impartiality
on the conduct of every one concerned in it 

she could hardly determine what her own expectation
of its event really was  though she earnestly tried
to drive away the notion of its being possible to end
otherwise at last  than in the marriage of edward and lucy 
what mrs  ferrars would say and do  though there could
not be a doubt of its nature  she was anxious to hear 
and still more anxious to know how edward would
conduct himself   for him she felt much compassion   
for lucy very little  and it cost her some pains to procure
that little   for the rest of the party none at all 

as mrs  jennings could talk on no other subject 
elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing marianne for
its discussion   no time was to be lost in undeceiving her 
in making her acquainted with the real truth  and in
endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others 
without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister 
or any resentment against edward 

elinor s office was a painful one   she was going
to remove what she really believed to be her sister s
chief consolation   to give such particulars of edward as she
feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion  and
to make marianne  by a resemblance in their situations 
which to her fancy would seem strong  feel all her own
disappointment over again   but unwelcome as such a task
must be  it was necessary to be done  and elinor therefore
hastened to perform it 

she was very far from wishing to dwell on her own
feelings  or to represent herself as suffering much 
any otherwise than as the self command she had practised
since her first knowledge of edward s engagement  might
suggest a hint of what was practicable to marianne 
her narration was clear and simple  and though it could
not be given without emotion  it was not accompanied
by violent agitation  nor impetuous grief   that belonged
rather to the hearer  for marianne listened with horror 
and cried excessively   elinor was to be the comforter
of others in her own distresses  no less than in theirs 
and all the comfort that could be given by assurances
of her own composure of mind  and a very earnest
vindication of edward from every charge but of imprudence 
was readily offered 

but marianne for some time would give credit to neither 
edward seemed a second willoughby  and acknowledging
as elinor did  that she had loved him most sincerely 
could she feel less than herself   as for lucy steele 
she considered her so totally unamiable  so absolutely
incapable of attaching a sensible man  that she could
not be persuaded at first to believe  and afterwards
to pardon  any former affection of edward for her 
she would not even admit it to have been natural 
and elinor left her to be convinced that it was so 
by that which only could convince her  a better knowledge
of mankind 

her first communication had reached no farther than
to state the fact of the engagement  and the length of time
it had existed   marianne s feelings had then broken in 
and put an end to all regularity of detail  and for some
time all that could be done was to soothe her distress 
lessen her alarms  and combat her resentment   the first
question on her side  which led to farther particulars 
was 

 how long has this been known to you  elinor  has
he written to you  

 i have known it these four months   when lucy
first came to barton park last november  she told me
in confidence of her engagement  

at these words  marianne s eyes expressed the astonishment
which her lips could not utter   after a pause of wonder 
she exclaimed  

 four months   have you known of this four months  

elinor confirmed it 

 what   while attending me in all my misery  has this
been on your heart   and i have reproached you for being
happy    

 it was not fit that you should then know how much
i was the reverse  

 four months    cried marianne again    so calm   
so cheerful   how have you been supported    

 by feeling that i was doing my duty   my promise to
lucy  obliged me to be secret   i owed it to her  therefore 
to avoid giving any hint of the truth  and i owed it to my
family and friends  not to create in them a solicitude about me 
which it could not be in my power to satisfy  

marianne seemed much struck 

 i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my
mother   added elinor   and once or twice i have attempted it   
but without betraying my trust  i never could have convinced
you  

 four months   and yet you loved him    

 yes  but i did not love only him   and while the comfort
of others was dear to me  i was glad to spare them from knowing
how much i felt   now  i can think and speak of it with
little emotion   i would not have you suffer on my account 
for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself 
i have many things to support me   i am not conscious of having
provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own 
i have borne it as much as possible without spreading
it farther   i acquit edward of essential misconduct 
i wish him very happy  and i am so sure of his always
doing his duty  that though now he may harbour some regret 
in the end he must become so   lucy does not want sense 
and that is the foundation on which every thing good may
be built   and after all  marianne  after all that is
bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment 
and all that can be said of one s happiness depending
entirely on any particular person  it is not meant  it
is not fit  it is not possible that it should be so   
edward will marry lucy  he will marry a woman superior
in person and understanding to half her sex  and time
and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought
another superior to her    

 if such is your way of thinking   said marianne 
 if the loss of what is most valued is so easily
to be made up by something else  your resolution 
your self command  are  perhaps  a little less to be
wondered at   they are brought more within my comprehension  

 i understand you   you do not suppose that i have ever
felt much   for four months  marianne  i have had all this
hanging on my mind  without being at liberty to speak
of it to a single creature  knowing that it would make
you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained
to you  yet unable to prepare you for it in the least   
it was told me   it was in a manner forced on me by the
very person herself  whose prior engagement ruined all
my prospects  and told me  as i thought  with triumph   
this person s suspicions  therefore  i have had to oppose 
by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most
deeply interested   and it has not been only once   i have
had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again   
i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever 
without hearing one circumstance that could make me less
desire the connection   nothing has proved him unworthy 
nor has anything declared him indifferent to me   
i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister 
and the insolence of his mother  and have suffered the
punishment of an attachment  without enjoying its advantages   
and all this has been going on at a time  when  as you
know too well  it has not been my only unhappiness   
if you can think me capable of ever feeling  surely you
may suppose that i have suffered now   the composure
of mind with which i have brought myself at present
to consider the matter  the consolation that i have been
willing to admit  have been the effect of constant and
painful exertion   they did not spring up of themselves   
they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first   
no  marianne   then  if i had not been bound to silence 
perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely  not even what i
owed to my dearest friends  from openly shewing that i was
very unhappy    

marianne was quite subdued   

 oh  elinor   she cried   you have made me hate
myself for ever   how barbarous have i been to you   
you  who have been my only comfort  who have borne with me
in all my misery  who have seemed to be only suffering
for me   is this my gratitude   is this the only return i
can make you   because your merit cries out upon myself 
i have been trying to do it away  

the tenderest caresses followed this confession 
in such a frame of mind as she was now in  elinor had
no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise
she required  and at her request  marianne engaged
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least
appearance of bitterness   to meet lucy without betraying
the smallest increase of dislike to her   and even to see
edward himself  if chance should bring them together 
without any diminution of her usual cordiality   
these were great concessions   but where marianne felt
that she had injured  no reparation could be too much
for her to make 

she performed her promise of being discreet 
to admiration   she attended to all that mrs  jennings
had to say upon the subject  with an unchanging complexion 
dissented from her in nothing  and was heard three
times to say   yes  ma am    she listened to her praise
of lucy with only moving from one chair to another 
and when mrs  jennings talked of edward s affection 
it cost her only a spasm in her throat   such advances
towards heroism in her sister  made elinor feel equal
to any thing herself 

the next morning brought a farther trial of it 
in a visit from their brother  who came with a most serious
aspect to talk over the dreadful affair  and bring them
news of his wife 

 you have heard  i suppose   said he with great solemnity 
as soon as he was seated   of the very shocking discovery
that took place under our roof yesterday  

they all looked their assent  it seemed too awful
a moment for speech 

 your sister   he continued   has suffered dreadfully 
mrs  ferrars too  in short it has been a scene of such
complicated distress  but i will hope that the storm may
be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome 
poor fanny  she was in hysterics all yesterday 
but i would not alarm you too much   donavan says there
is nothing materially to be apprehended  her constitution
is a good one  and her resolution equal to any thing 
she has borne it all  with the fortitude of an angel 
she says she never shall think well of anybody again 
and one cannot wonder at it  after being so deceived   
meeting with such ingratitude  where so much kindness
had been shewn  so much confidence had been placed   it
was quite out of the benevolence of her heart  that she
had asked these young women to her house  merely because
she thought they deserved some attention  were harmless 
well behaved girls  and would be pleasant companions 
for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you
and marianne to be with us  while your kind friend there 
was attending her daughter   and now to be so rewarded 
 i wish  with all my heart   says poor fanny in her
affectionate way   that we had asked your sisters instead
of them   

here he stopped to be thanked  which being done 
he went on 

 what poor mrs  ferrars suffered  when first fanny
broke it to her  is not to be described   while she with
the truest affection had been planning a most eligible
connection for him  was it to be supposed that he could
be all the time secretly engaged to another person   such
a suspicion could never have entered her head   if she
suspected any prepossession elsewhere  it could not be
in that quarter    there  to be sure   said she   i might
have thought myself safe   she was quite in an agony 
we consulted together  however  as to what should be done 
and at last she determined to send for edward 
he came   but i am sorry to relate what ensued 
all that mrs  ferrars could say to make him put an end
to the engagement  assisted too as you may well suppose
by my arguments  and fanny s entreaties  was of
no avail   duty  affection  every thing was disregarded 
i never thought edward so stubborn  so unfeeling before 
his mother explained to him her liberal designs  in case
of his marrying miss morton  told him she would settle on
him the norfolk estate  which  clear of land tax  brings
in a good thousand a year  offered even  when matters
grew desperate  to make it twelve hundred  and in opposition
to this  if he still persisted in this low connection 
represented to him the certain penury that must attend
the match   his own two thousand pounds she protested
should be his all  she would never see him again  and so far
would she be from affording him the smallest assistance 
that if he were to enter into any profession with a view
of better support  she would do all in her power to prevent
him advancing in it  

here marianne  in an ecstasy of indignation 
clapped her hands together  and cried   gracious god 
can this be possible  

 well may you wonder  marianne   replied her brother 
 at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these 
your exclamation is very natural  

marianne was going to retort  but she remembered
her promises  and forbore 

 all this  however   he continued   was urged in vain 
edward said very little  but what he did say  was in
the most determined manner   nothing should prevail on
him to give up his engagement   he would stand to it 
cost him what it might  

 then   cried mrs  jennings with blunt sincerity 
no longer able to be silent   he has acted like an honest
man  i beg your pardon  mr  dashwood  but if he had
done otherwise  i should have thought him a rascal 
i have some little concern in the business  as well
as yourself  for lucy steele is my cousin  and i believe
there is not a better kind of girl in the world  nor one
who more deserves a good husband  

john dashwood was greatly astonished  but his nature
was calm  not open to provocation  and he never wished
to offend anybody  especially anybody of good fortune 
he therefore replied  without any resentment 

 i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any
relation of yours  madam   miss lucy steele is  i dare say 
a very deserving young woman  but in the present case
you know  the connection must be impossible 
and to have entered into a secret engagement with a
young man under her uncle s care  the son of a woman
especially of such very large fortune as mrs  ferrars 
is perhaps  altogether a little extraordinary  in short 
i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person
whom you have a regard for  mrs  jennings   we all wish
her extremely happy  and mrs  ferrars s conduct throughout
the whole  has been such as every conscientious  good mother 
in like circumstances  would adopt   it has been dignified
and liberal   edward has drawn his own lot  and i fear
it will be a bad one  

marianne sighed out her similar apprehension 
and elinor s heart wrung for the feelings of edward 
while braving his mother s threats  for a woman who could
not reward him 

 well  sir   said mrs  jennings   and how did it end  

 i am sorry to say  ma am  in a most unhappy rupture   
edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s notice 
he left her house yesterday  but where he is gone  or whether
he is still in town  i do not know  for we of course can
make no inquiry  

 poor young man   and what is to become of him  

 what  indeed  ma am   it is a melancholy consideration 
born to the prospect of such affluence   i cannot conceive
a situation more deplorable   the interest of two thousand
pounds  how can a man live on it   and when to that is added
the recollection  that he might  but for his own folly 
within three months have been in the receipt of two
thousand  five hundred a year  for miss morton has
thirty thousand pounds   i cannot picture to myself
a more wretched condition   we must all feel for him 
and the more so  because it is totally out of our power
to assist him  

 poor young man   cried mrs  jennings   i am sure
he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house 
and so i would tell him if i could see him   it is not fit
that he should be living about at his own charge now 
at lodgings and taverns  

elinor s heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward 
though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it 

 if he would only have done as well by himself  
said john dashwood   as all his friends were disposed to do
by him  he might now have been in his proper situation 
and would have wanted for nothing   but as it is  it must
be out of anybody s power to assist him   and there is one
thing more preparing against him  which must be worse than
all  his mother has determined  with a very natural kind
of spirit  to settle that estate upon robert immediately 
which might have been edward s  on proper conditions 
i left her this morning with her lawyer  talking over
the business  

 well   said mrs  jennings   that is her revenge 
everybody has a way of their own   but i don t think mine
would be  to make one son independent  because another had
plagued me  

marianne got up and walked about the room 

 can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man  
continued john   than to see his younger brother in
possession of an estate which might have been his own 
poor edward   i feel for him sincerely  

a few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion 
concluded his visit  and with repeated assurances to his
sisters that he really believed there was no material
danger in fanny s indisposition  and that they need
not therefore be very uneasy about it  he went away 
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments
on the present occasion  as far at least as it regarded
mrs  ferrars s conduct  the dashwoods   and edward s 

marianne s indignation burst forth as soon as he
quitted the room  and as her vehemence made reserve
impossible in elinor  and unnecessary in mrs  jennings 
they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party 



chapter 38


mrs  jennings was very warm in her praise of edward s
conduct  but only elinor and marianne understood its
true merit   they only knew how little he had had to tempt
him to be disobedient  and how small was the consolation 
beyond the consciousness of doing right  that could
remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune 
elinor gloried in his integrity  and marianne forgave all
his offences in compassion for his punishment   but though
confidence between them was  by this public discovery 
restored to its proper state  it was not a subject on
which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone 
elinor avoided it upon principle  as tending to fix still
more upon her thoughts  by the too warm  too positive
assurances of marianne  that belief of edward s continued
affection for herself which she rather wished to do away 
and marianne s courage soon failed her  in trying
to converse upon a topic which always left her more
dissatisfied with herself than ever  by the comparison
it necessarily produced between elinor s conduct and her own 

she felt all the force of that comparison  but not
as her sister had hoped  to urge her to exertion now 
she felt it with all the pain of continual self reproach 
regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted
herself before  but it brought only the torture of penitence 
without the hope of amendment   her mind was so much weakened
that she still fancied present exertion impossible 
and therefore it only dispirited her more 

nothing new was heard by them  for a day or two afterwards 
of affairs in harley street  or bartlett s buildings 
but though so much of the matter was known to them already 
that mrs  jennings might have had enough to do in spreading
that knowledge farther  without seeking after more 
she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort
and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could 
and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual 
had prevented her going to them within that time 

the third day succeeding their knowledge of the
particulars  was so fine  so beautiful a sunday as to draw
many to kensington gardens  though it was only the second
week in march   mrs  jennings and elinor were of the number 
but marianne  who knew that the willoughbys were again
in town  and had a constant dread of meeting them 
chose rather to stay at home  than venture into so public
a place 

an intimate acquaintance of mrs  jennings joined
them soon after they entered the gardens  and elinor was
not sorry that by her continuing with them  and engaging
all mrs  jennings s conversation  she was herself left
to quiet reflection   she saw nothing of the willoughbys 
nothing of edward  and for some time nothing of anybody
who could by any chance whether grave or gay  be interesting
to her   but at last she found herself with some surprise 
accosted by miss steele  who  though looking rather shy 
expressed great satisfaction in meeting them  and on receiving
encouragement from the particular kindness of mrs  jennings 
left her own party for a short time  to join their s 
mrs  jennings immediately whispered to elinor 

 get it all out of her  my dear   she will tell you
any thing if you ask   you see i cannot leave mrs  clarke  

it was lucky  however  for mrs  jennings s curiosity
and elinor s too  that she would tell any thing without
being asked  for nothing would otherwise have been learnt 

 i am so glad to meet you   said miss steele 
taking her familiarly by the arm   for i wanted to see you
of all things in the world    and then lowering her voice 
 i suppose mrs  jennings has heard all about it 
is she angry  

 not at all  i believe  with you  

 that is a good thing   and lady middleton  is she angry  

 i cannot suppose it possible that she should  

 i am monstrous glad of it   good gracious   i have
had such a time of it   i never saw lucy in such a rage
in my life   she vowed at first she would never trim me
up a new bonnet  nor do any thing else for me again 
so long as she lived  but now she is quite come to 
and we are as good friends as ever   look  she made me
this bow to my hat  and put in the feather last night 
there now  you are going to laugh at me too   but why
should not i wear pink ribbons   i do not care if it is
the doctor s favourite colour   i am sure  for my part 
i should never have known he did like it better than
any other colour  if he had not happened to say so 
my cousins have been so plaguing me   i declare sometimes
i do not know which way to look before them  

she had wandered away to a subject on which elinor
had nothing to say  and therefore soon judged it expedient
to find her way back again to the first 

 well  but miss dashwood   speaking triumphantly 
 people may say what they chuse about mr  ferrars s
declaring he would not have lucy  for it is no such thing
i can tell you  and it is quite a shame for such ill natured
reports to be spread abroad   whatever lucy might think
about it herself  you know  it was no business of other
people to set it down for certain  

 i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before 
i assure you   said elinor 

 oh  did not you   but it was said  i know  very well 
and by more than one  for miss godby told miss sparks 
that nobody in their senses could expect mr  ferrars
to give up a woman like miss morton  with thirty thousand
pounds to her fortune  for lucy steele that had
nothing at all  and i had it from miss sparks myself 
and besides that  my cousin richard said himself 
that when it came to the point he was afraid mr  ferrars
would be off  and when edward did not come near us
for three days  i could not tell what to think myself 
and i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost 
for we came away from your brother s wednesday 
and we saw nothing of him not all thursday  friday 
and saturday  and did not know what was become of him 
once lucy thought to write to him  but then her spirits
rose against that   however this morning he came just
as we came home from church  and then it all came out 
how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street 
and been talked to by his mother and all of them 
and how he had declared before them all that he loved
nobody but lucy  and nobody but lucy would he have 
and how he had been so worried by what passed 
that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house 
he had got upon his horse  and rid into the country 
some where or other  and how he had stayed about at an inn
all thursday and friday  on purpose to get the better
of it   and after thinking it all over and over again 
he said  it seemed to him as if  now he had no fortune 
and no nothing at all  it would be quite unkind to keep
her on to the engagement  because it must be for her loss 
for he had nothing but two thousand pounds  and no hope
of any thing else  and if he was to go into orders 
as he had some thoughts  he could get nothing but a curacy 
and how was they to live upon that   he could not bear
to think of her doing no better  and so he begged 
if she had the least mind for it  to put an end to the
matter directly  and leave him shift for himself 
i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be 
and it was entirely for her sake  and upon her account 
that he said a word about being off  and not upon his own 
i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being
tired of her  or of wishing to marry miss morton  or any
thing like it   but  to be sure  lucy would not give
ear to such kind of talking  so she told him directly
 with a great deal about sweet and love  you know 
and all that  oh  la  one can t repeat such kind of things
you know   she told him directly  she had not the least
mind in the world to be off  for she could live with him
upon a trifle  and how little so ever he might have 
she should be very glad to have it all  you know 
or something of the kind   so then he was monstrous happy 
and talked on some time about what they should do 
and they agreed he should take orders directly 
and they must wait to be married till he got a living 
and just then i could not hear any more  for my cousin
called from below to tell me mrs  richardson was come in
her coach  and would take one of us to kensington gardens 
so i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them 
to ask lucy if she would like to go  but she did not
care to leave edward  so i just run up stairs and put
on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons  

 i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them  
said elinor   you were all in the same room together 
were not you  

 no  indeed  not us   la  miss dashwood  do you
think people make love when any body else is by   oh 
for shame   to be sure you must know better than that 
 laughing affectedly    no  no  they were shut up in the
drawing room together  and all i heard was only by listening
at the door  

 how   cried elinor   have you been repeating to me
what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door 
i am sorry i did not know it before  for i certainly
would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a
conversation which you ought not to have known yourself 
how could you behave so unfairly by your sister  

 oh  la  there is nothing in that   i only stood at
the door  and heard what i could   and i am sure lucy would
have done just the same by me  for a year or two back 
when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together 
she never made any bones of hiding in a closet  or behind
a chimney board  on purpose to hear what we said  

elinor tried to talk of something else  but miss
steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes 
from what was uppermost in her mind 

 edward talks of going to oxford soon   said she 
 but now he is lodging at no      pall mall   what an
ill natured woman his mother is  an t she  and your
brother and sister were not very kind  however 
i shan t say anything against them to you  and to be sure
they did send us home in their own chariot  which
was more than i looked for   and for my part  i was all
in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the
huswifes she had gave us a day or two before  but  however 
nothing was said about them  and i took care to keep mine
out of sight   edward have got some business at oxford 
he says  so he must go there for a time  and after that 
as soon as he can light upon a bishop  he will be ordained 
i wonder what curacy he will get   good gracious 
 giggling as she spoke  i d lay my life i know what
my cousins will say  when they hear of it   they will
tell me i should write to the doctor  to get edward
the curacy of his new living   i know they will  but i am
sure i would not do such a thing for all the world   
 la   i shall say directly   i wonder how you could think
of such a thing   i write to the doctor  indeed   

 well   said elinor   it is a comfort to be prepared
against the worst   you have got your answer ready  

miss steele was going to reply on the same subject 
but the approach of her own party made another more necessary 

 oh  la  here come the richardsons   i had a vast deal
more to say to you  but i must not stay away from them not
any longer   i assure you they are very genteel people 
he makes a monstrous deal of money  and they keep their
own coach   i have not time to speak to mrs  jennings about
it myself  but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she
is not in anger against us  and lady middleton the same 
and if anything should happen to take you and your
sister away  and mrs  jennings should want company 
i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her
for as long a time as she likes   i suppose lady middleton
won t ask us any more this bout   good by  i am sorry
miss marianne was not here   remember me kindly to her 
la  if you have not got your spotted muslin on   i wonder
you was not afraid of its being torn  

such was her parting concern  for after this  she had
time only to pay her farewell compliments to mrs  jennings 
before her company was claimed by mrs  richardson 
and elinor was left in possession of knowledge which
might feed her powers of reflection some time  though she
had learnt very little more than what had been already
foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind   edward s marriage
with lucy was as firmly determined on  and the time
of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain 
as she had concluded it would be   every thing depended 
exactly after her expectation  on his getting that preferment 
of which  at present  there seemed not the smallest chance 

as soon as they returned to the carriage 
mrs  jennings was eager for information  but as elinor
wished to spread as little as possible intelligence
that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained 
she confined herself to the brief repetition of such
simple particulars  as she felt assured that lucy 
for the sake of her own consequence  would choose
to have known   the continuance of their engagement 
and the means that were able to be taken for promoting
its end  was all her communication  and this produced
from mrs  jennings the following natural remark 

 wait for his having a living   ay  we all know how
that will end   they will wait a twelvemonth  and finding
no good comes of it  will set down upon a curacy of fifty
pounds a year  with the interest of his two thousand pounds 
and what little matter mr  steele and mr  pratt can
give her   then they will have a child every year  and
lord help  em  how poor they will be   i must see
what i can give them towards furnishing their house 
two maids and two men  indeed   as i talked of t other
day   no  no  they must get a stout girl of all works   
betty s sister would never do for them now  

the next morning brought elinor a letter by the
two penny post from lucy herself   it was as follows 

                     bartlett s building  march 

      i hope my dear miss dashwood will excuse the
     liberty i take of writing to her  but i know your
     friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such
     a good account of myself and my dear edward  after
     all the troubles we have went through lately 
     therefore will make no more apologies  but proceed
     to say that  thank god  though we have suffered
     dreadfully  we are both quite well now  and as happy
     as we must always be in one another s love   we have
     had great trials  and great persecutions  but
     however  at the same time  gratefully acknowledge
     many friends  yourself not the least among them 
     whose great kindness i shall always thankfully
     remember  as will edward too  who i have told of
     it   i am sure you will be glad to hear  as likewise
     dear mrs  jennings  i spent two happy hours with
     him yesterday afternoon  he would not hear of our
     parting  though earnestly did i  as i thought my
     duty required  urge him to it for prudence sake 
     and would have parted for ever on the spot  would
     he consent to it  but he said it should never be 
     he did not regard his mother s anger  while he could
     have my affections  our prospects are not very
     bright  to be sure  but we must wait  and hope for
     the best  he will be ordained shortly  and should
     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any
     body that has a living to bestow  am very sure you
     will not forget us  and dear mrs  jennings too 
     trust she will speak a good word for us to sir john 
     or mr  palmer  or any friend that may be able to
     assist us   poor anne was much to blame for what
     she did  but she did it for the best  so i say
     nothing  hope mrs  jennings won t think it too much
     trouble to give us a call  should she come this way
     any morning   twould be a great kindness  and my
     cousins would be proud to know her   my paper reminds
     me to conclude  and begging to be most gratefully
     and respectfully remembered to her  and to sir john 
     and lady middleton  and the dear children  when you
     chance to see them  and love to miss marianne 

                                       i am   c  

as soon as elinor had finished it  she performed
what she concluded to be its writer s real design 
by placing it in the hands of mrs  jennings  who read it
aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise 

 very well indeed   how prettily she writes   aye 
that was quite proper to let him be off if he would 
that was just like lucy   poor soul  i wish i could get
him a living  with all my heart   she calls me dear
mrs  jennings  you see   she is a good hearted girl
as ever lived   very well upon my word   that sentence
is very prettily turned   yes  yes  i will go and see her 
sure enough   how attentive she is  to think of every
body   thank you  my dear  for shewing it me   it is
as pretty a letter as ever i saw  and does lucy s head
and heart great credit  



chapter 39


the miss dashwoods had now been rather more than
two months in town  and marianne s impatience to be gone
increased every day   she sighed for the air  the liberty 
the quiet of the country  and fancied that if any place
could give her ease  barton must do it   elinor was hardly
less anxious than herself for their removal  and only so much
less bent on its being effected immediately  as that she
was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey 
which marianne could not be brought to acknowledge 
she began  however  seriously to turn her thoughts towards
its accomplishment  and had already mentioned their wishes
to their kind hostess  who resisted them with all the
eloquence of her good will  when a plan was suggested 
which  though detaining them from home yet a few weeks
longer  appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible
than any other  the palmers were to remove to cleveland
about the end of march  for the easter holidays 
and mrs  jennings  with both her friends  received a very
warm invitation from charlotte to go with them   this would
not  in itself  have been sufficient for the delicacy of
miss dashwood   but it was inforced with so much real
politeness by mr  palmer himself  as  joined to the very
great amendment of his manners towards them since her
sister had been known to be unhappy  induced her to accept
it with pleasure 

when she told marianne what she had done  however 
her first reply was not very auspicious 

 cleveland    she cried  with great agitation 
 no  i cannot go to cleveland    

 you forget   said elinor gently   that its situation
is not   that it is not in the neighbourhood of    

 but it is in somersetshire   i cannot go
into somersetshire   there  where i looked forward
to going   no  elinor  you cannot expect me to go there  

elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming
such feelings   she only endeavoured to counteract them by
working on others   represented it  therefore  as a measure
which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother 
whom she so much wished to see  in a more eligible 
more comfortable manner  than any other plan could do 
and perhaps without any greater delay   from cleveland 
which was within a few miles of bristol  the distance to
barton was not beyond one day  though a long day s journey 
and their mother s servant might easily come there to attend
them down  and as there could be no occasion of their
staying above a week at cleveland  they might now be at
home in little more than three weeks  time   as marianne s
affection for her mother was sincere  it must triumph
with little difficulty  over the imaginary evils she had started 

mrs  jennings was so far from being weary of her guest 
that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again
from cleveland   elinor was grateful for the attention 
but it could not alter her design  and their mother s
concurrence being readily gained  every thing relative
to their return was arranged as far as it could be   
and marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement
of the hours that were yet to divide her from barton 

 ah  colonel  i do not know what you and i shall
do without the miss dashwoods    was mrs  jennings s
address to him when he first called on her  after their
leaving her was settled   for they are quite resolved
upon going home from the palmers   and how forlorn we
shall be  when i come back   lord  we shall sit and gape
at one another as dull as two cats  

perhaps mrs  jennings was in hopes  by this vigorous
sketch of their future ennui  to provoke him to make
that offer  which might give himself an escape from it   
and if so  she had soon afterwards good reason to think
her object gained  for  on elinor s moving to the window
to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print 
which she was going to copy for her friend  he followed
her to it with a look of particular meaning  and conversed
with her there for several minutes   the effect of his
discourse on the lady too  could not escape her observation 
for though she was too honorable to listen  and had even
changed her seat  on purpose that she might not hear 
to one close by the piano forte on which marianne
was playing  she could not keep herself from seeing
that elinor changed colour  attended with agitation 
and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment   
still farther in confirmation of her hopes  in the interval
of marianne s turning from one lesson to another 
some words of the colonel s inevitably reached her ear 
in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness
of his house   this set the matter beyond a doubt 
she wondered  indeed  at his thinking it necessary
to do so  but supposed it to be the proper etiquette 
what elinor said in reply she could not distinguish 
but judged from the motion of her lips  that she did
not think that any material objection   and mrs  jennings
commended her in her heart for being so honest 
they then talked on for a few minutes longer without her
catching a syllable  when another lucky stop in marianne s
performance brought her these words in the colonel s calm voice   

 i am afraid it cannot take place very soon  

astonished and shocked at so unlover like a speech 
she was almost ready to cry out   lord  what should
hinder it    but checking her desire  confined herself
to this silent ejaculation 

 this is very strange   sure he need not wait to be older  

this delay on the colonel s side  however  did not
seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least 
for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards 
and moving different ways  mrs  jennings very plainly heard
elinor say  and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said 

 i shall always think myself very much obliged to you  

mrs  jennings was delighted with her gratitude 
and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence 
the colonel should be able to take leave of them  as he
immediately did  with the utmost sang froid  and go away
without making her any reply   she had not thought her old
friend could have made so indifferent a suitor 

what had really passed between them was to this effect 

 i have heard   said he  with great compassion 
 of the injustice your friend mr  ferrars has suffered
from his family  for if i understand the matter right 
he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering
in his engagement with a very deserving young woman   
have i been rightly informed   is it so    

elinor told him that it was 

 the cruelty  the impolitic cruelty    he replied 
with great feeling    of dividing  or attempting to divide 
two young people long attached to each other  is terrible   
mrs  ferrars does not know what she may be doing  what
she may drive her son to   i have seen mr  ferrars two
or three times in harley street  and am much pleased
with him   he is not a young man with whom one can
be intimately acquainted in a short time  but i have
seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake 
and as a friend of yours  i wish it still more 
i understand that he intends to take orders   will you
be so good as to tell him that the living of delaford 
now just vacant  as i am informed by this day s post 
is his  if he think it worth his acceptance  but that 
perhaps  so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now 
it may be  nonsense to appear to doubt  i only wish it
were more  valuable    it is a rectory  but a small one 
the late incumbent  i believe  did not make more than
200 l per annum  and though it is certainly capable
of improvement  i fear  not to such an amount as
to afford him a very comfortable income   such as it is 
however  my pleasure in presenting him to it 
will be very great   pray assure him of it  

elinor s astonishment at this commission could
hardly have been greater  had the colonel been really
making her an offer of his hand   the preferment 
which only two days before she had considered as hopeless
for edward  was already provided to enable him to marry   
and she  of all people in the world  was fixed on to
bestow it   her emotion was such as mrs  jennings had
attributed to a very different cause   but whatever minor
feelings less pure  less pleasing  might have a share
in that emotion  her esteem for the general benevolence 
and her gratitude for the particular friendship 
which together prompted colonel brandon to this act 
were strongly felt  and warmly expressed   she thanked him
for it with all her heart  spoke of edward s principles and
disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve 
and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure 
if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office
to another   but at the same time  she could not help
thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself 
it was an office in short  from which  unwilling to give
edward the pain of receiving an obligation from her 
she would have been very glad to be spared herself   
but colonel brandon  on motives of equal delicacy 
declining it likewise  still seemed so desirous of its being
given through her means  that she would not on any account
make farther opposition   edward  she believed  was still in
town 
and fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele 
she could undertake therefore to inform him of it 
in the course of the day   after this had been settled 
colonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage
in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour 
and then it was that he mentioned with regret  that the
house was small and indifferent   an evil which elinor 
as mrs  jennings had supposed her to do  made very light of 
at least as far as regarded its size 

 the smallness of the house   said she 
 i cannot imagine any inconvenience to them 
for it will be in proportion to their family and income  

by which the colonel was surprised to find that she
was considering mr  ferrars s marriage as the certain
consequence of the presentation  for he did not suppose it
possible that delaford living could supply such an income 
as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on  
and he said so 

 this little rectory can do no more than make mr  ferrars
comfortable as a bachelor  it cannot enable him to marry 
i am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this 
and my interest is hardly more extensive   if  however 
by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve
him farther  i must think very differently of him
from what i now do  if i am not as ready to be useful
to him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present 
what i am now doing indeed  seems nothing at all 
since it can advance him so little towards what must
be his principal  his only object of happiness 
his marriage must still be a distant good   at least 
i am afraid it cannot take place very soon    

such was the sentence which  when misunderstood 
so justly offended the delicate feelings of mrs  jennings 
but after this narration of what really passed between
colonel brandon and elinor  while they stood at the window 
the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting  may
perhaps appear in general  not less reasonably excited 
nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from
an offer of marriage 



chapter 40


 well  miss dashwood   said mrs  jennings 
sagaciously smiling  as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn 
 i do not ask you what the colonel has been saying to you 
for though  upon my honour  i tried to keep out of hearing 
i could not help catching enough to understand his business 
and i assure you i never was better pleased in my life 
and i wish you joy of it with all my heart  

 thank you  ma am   said elinor    it is a matter
of great joy to me  and i feel the goodness of colonel
brandon most sensibly   there are not many men who would
act as he has done   few people who have so compassionate
a heart   i never was more astonished in my life  

 lord  my dear  you are very modest   i an t the least
astonished at it in the world  for i have often thought
of late  there was nothing more likely to happen  

 you judged from your knowledge of the colonel s
general benevolence  but at least you could not foresee
that the opportunity would so very soon occur  

 opportunity   repeated mrs  jennings   oh  as to that 
when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing 
somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity 
well  my dear  i wish you joy of it again and again 
and if ever there was a happy couple in the world  i think
i shall soon know where to look for them  

 you mean to go to delaford after them i suppose  
said elinor  with a faint smile 

 aye  my dear  that i do  indeed   and as to the house
being a bad one  i do not know what the colonel would be at 
for it is as good a one as ever i saw  

 he spoke of its being out of repair  

 well  and whose fault is that  why don t he repair it   
who should do it but himself  

they were interrupted by the servant s coming in to
announce the carriage being at the door  and mrs  jennings
immediately preparing to go  said   

 well  my dear  i must be gone before i have had half
my talk out   but  however  we may have it all over in
the evening  for we shall be quite alone   i do not ask
you to go with me  for i dare say your mind is too full
of the matter to care for company  and besides  you must
long to tell your sister all about it  

marianne had left the room before the conversation began 

 certainly  ma am  i shall tell marianne of it 
but i shall not mention it at present to any body else  

 oh  very well   said mrs  jennings rather disappointed 
 then you would not have me tell it to lucy  for i think
of going as far as holborn to day  

 no  ma am  not even lucy if you please 
one day s delay will not be very material  and till i
have written to mr  ferrars  i think it ought not to be
mentioned to any body else   i shall do that directly 
it is of importance that no time should be lost with him 
for he will of course have much to do relative to
his ordination  

this speech at first puzzled mrs  jennings exceedingly 
why mr  ferrars was to have been written to about it
in such a hurry  she could not immediately comprehend 
a few moments  reflection  however  produced a very happy idea 
and she exclaimed   

 oh  ho   i understand you   mr  ferrars is to be
the man   well  so much the better for him   ay  to be sure 
he must be ordained in readiness  and i am very glad
to find things are so forward between you   but  my dear 
is not this rather out of character   should not the colonel
write himself   sure  he is the proper person  

elinor did not quite understand the beginning of
mrs  jennings s speech  neither did she think it worth
inquiring into  and therefore only replied to its conclusion 

 colonel brandon is so delicate a man  that he rather
wished any one to announce his intentions to mr  ferrars
than himself  

 and so you are forced to do it   well that is an odd
kind of delicacy   however  i will not disturb you  seeing
her preparing to write    you know your own concerns best 
so goodby  my dear   i have not heard of any thing to
please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed  

and away she went  but returning again in a moment 

 i have just been thinking of betty s sister  my dear 
i should be very glad to get her so good a mistress 
but whether she would do for a lady s maid  i am sure i
can t tell   she is an excellent housemaid  and works
very well at her needle   however  you will think of all
that at your leisure  

 certainly  ma am   replied elinor  not hearing
much of what she said  and more anxious to be alone 
than to be mistress of the subject 

how she should begin  how she should express
herself in her note to edward  was now all her concern 
the particular circumstances between them made
a difficulty of that which to any other person would
have been the easiest thing in the world  but she
equally feared to say too much or too little  and sat
deliberating over her paper  with the pen in her band 
till broken in on by the entrance of edward himself 

he had met mrs  jennings at the door in her way to
the carriage  as he came to leave his farewell card  and she 
after apologising for not returning herself  had obliged
him to enter  by saying that miss dashwood was above 
and wanted to speak with him on very particular business 

elinor had just been congratulating herself 
in the midst of her perplexity  that however difficult it
might be to express herself properly by letter  it was
at least preferable to giving the information by word
of mouth  when her visitor entered  to force her upon this
greatest exertion of all   her astonishment and confusion
were very great on his so sudden appearance   she had
not seen him before since his engagement became public 
and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted
with it  which  with the consciousness of what she
had been thinking of  and what she had to tell him 
made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes 
he too was much distressed  and they sat down together
in a most promising state of embarrassment   whether he
had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming
into the room  he could not recollect  but determining
to be on the safe side  he made his apology in form
as soon as he could say any thing  after taking a chair 

 mrs  jennings told me   said he   that you wished
to speak with me  at least i understood her so  or i
certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner 
though at the same time  i should have been extremely
sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister 
especially as it will most likely be some time  it
is not probable that i should soon have the pleasure
of meeting you again   i go to oxford tomorrow  

 you would not have gone  however   said elinor 
recovering herself  and determined to get over what she
so much dreaded as soon as possible   without receiving
our good wishes  even if we had not been able to give them
in person   mrs  jennings was quite right in what she said 
i have something of consequence to inform you of 
which i was on the point of communicating by paper 
i am charged with a most agreeable office  breathing
rather faster than usual as she spoke    colonel brandon 
who was here only ten minutes ago  has desired me to say 
that understanding you mean to take orders  he has
great pleasure in offering you the living of delaford
now just vacant  and only wishes it were more valuable 
allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable
and well judging a friend  and to join in his wish that
the living  it is about two hundred a year  were much
more considerable  and such as might better enable you
to  as might be more than a temporary accommodation to
yourself  such  in short  as might establish all your views
of happiness  

what edward felt  as he could not say it himself 
it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him 
he looked all the astonishment which such unexpected 
such unthought of information could not fail of exciting 
but he said only these two words 

 colonel brandon  

 yes   continued elinor  gathering more resolution 
as some of the worst was over   colonel brandon means
it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately
passed  for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable
conduct of your family has placed you  a concern
which i am sure marianne  myself  and all your friends 
must share  and likewise as a proof of his high esteem
for your general character  and his particular approbation
of your behaviour on the present occasion  

 colonel brandon give me a living   can it be possible  

 the unkindness of your own relations has made you
astonished to find friendship any where  

 no   replied be  with sudden consciousness   not to
find it in you  for i cannot be ignorant that to you 
to your goodness  i owe it all   i feel it  i would express
it if i could  but  as you well know  i am no orator  

 you are very much mistaken   i do assure you
that you owe it entirely  at least almost entirely 
to your own merit  and colonel brandon s discernment
of it   i have had no hand in it   i did not even know 
till i understood his design  that the living was vacant 
nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have
had such a living in his gift   as a friend of mine 
of my family  he may  perhaps  indeed i know he has 
still greater pleasure in bestowing it  but  upon my word 
you owe nothing to my solicitation  

truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share
in the action  but she was at the same time so unwilling
to appear as the benefactress of edward  that she acknowledged
it with hesitation  which probably contributed to fix
that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it 
for a short time he sat deep in thought  after elinor had ceased
to speak   at last  and as if it were rather an effort  he said 

 colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability 
i have always heard him spoken of as such  and your brother
i know esteems him highly   he is undoubtedly a sensible man 
and in his manners perfectly the gentleman  

 indeed   replied elinor   i believe that you will find him 
on farther acquaintance  all that you have heard him to be 
and as you will be such very near neighbours  for i understand
the parsonage is almost close to the mansion house  
it is particularly important that he should be all this  

edward made no answer  but when she had turned
away her head  gave her a look so serious  so earnest 
so uncheerful  as seemed to say  that he might hereafter wish
the distance between the parsonage and the mansion house
much greater 

 colonel brandon  i think  lodges in st  james street  
said he  soon afterwards  rising from his chair 

elinor told him the number of the house 

 i must hurry away then  to give him those thanks
which you will not allow me to give you  to assure him
that he has made me a very  an exceedingly happy man  

elinor did not offer to detain him  and they parted 
with a very earnest assurance on her side of her unceasing
good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation
that might befall him  on his  with rather an attempt to
return the same good will  than the power of expressing it 

 when i see him again   said elinor to herself 
as the door shut him out   i shall see him the husband
of lucy  

and with this pleasing anticipation  she sat down
to reconsider the past  recall the words and endeavour
to comprehend all the feelings of edward  and  of course 
to reflect on her own with discontent 

when mrs  jennings came home  though she returned
from seeing people whom she had never seen before 
and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say 
her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret
in her possession  than by anything else  that she
reverted to it again as soon as elinor appeared 

 well  my dear   she cried   i sent you up to the
young man   did not i do right   and i suppose you had
no great difficulty  you did not find him very unwilling
to accept your proposal  

 no  ma am  that was not very likely  

 well  and how soon will he be ready   for it seems
all to depend upon that  

 really   said elinor   i know so little of these kind
of forms  that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time 
or the preparation necessary  but i suppose two or three
months will complete his ordination  

 two or three months   cried mrs  jennings   lord  my dear 
how calmly you talk of it  and can the colonel wait two
or three months  lord bless me   i am sure it would put me
quite out of patience   and though one would be very glad
to do a kindness by poor mr  ferrars  i do think it is
not worth while to wait two or three months for him 
sure somebody else might be found that would do as well 
somebody that is in orders already  

 my dear ma am   said elinor   what can you be thinking of   
why  colonel brandon s only object is to be of use to mr  ferrars  

 lord bless you  my dear   sure you do not mean to persuade
me that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving
ten guineas to mr  ferrars  

the deception could not continue after this 
and an explanation immediately took place  by which both
gained considerable amusement for the moment  without any
material loss of happiness to either  for mrs  jennings
only exchanged one form of delight for another  and still
without forfeiting her expectation of the first 

 aye  aye  the parsonage is but a small one   said she 
after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction
was over   and very likely may be out of repair  but to hear
a man apologising  as i thought  for a house that to my
knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground floor  and i
think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds   
and to you too  that had been used to live in barton cottage   
it seems quite ridiculous   but  my dear  we must
touch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonage 
and make it comfortable for them  before lucy goes to it  

 but colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea
of the living s being enough to allow them to marry  

 the colonel is a ninny  my dear  because he has two
thousand a year himself  he thinks that nobody else can marry
on less   take my word for it  that  if i am alive  i shall
be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas 
and i am sure i sha nt go if lucy an t there  

elinor was quite of her opinion  as to the probability
of their not waiting for any thing more 



chapter 41


edward  having carried his thanks to colonel brandon 
proceeded with his happiness to lucy  and such was the
excess of it by the time he reached bartlett s buildings 
that she was able to assure mrs  jennings  who called
on her again the next day with her congratulations 
that she had never seen him in such spirits before
in her life 

her own happiness  and her own spirits  were at
least very certain  and she joined mrs  jennings most
heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably
together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas 
so far was she  at the same time  from any backwardness
to give elinor that credit which edward would give her 
that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most
grateful warmth  was ready to own all their obligation
to her  and openly declared that no exertion for their
good on miss dashwood s part  either present or future 
would ever surprise her  for she believed her capable of
doing any thing in the world for those she really valued 
as for colonel brandon  she was not only ready to worship
him as a saint  but was moreover truly anxious that
he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns 
anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost 
and scarcely resolved to avail herself  at delaford 
as far as she possibly could  of his servants  his carriage 
his cows  and his poultry 

it was now above a week since john dashwood had
called in berkeley street  and as since that time no notice
had been taken by them of his wife s indisposition 
beyond one verbal enquiry  elinor began to feel it
necessary to pay her a visit   this was an obligation 
however  which not only opposed her own inclination 
but which had not the assistance of any encouragement
from her companions   marianne  not contented with
absolutely refusing to go herself  was very urgent
to prevent her sister s going at all  and mrs  jennings 
though her carriage was always at elinor s service 
so very much disliked mrs  john dashwood  that not even her
curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery 
nor her strong desire to affront her by taking edward s part 
could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again 
the consequence was  that elinor set out by herself
to pay a visit  for which no one could really have
less inclination  and to run the risk of a tete a tete
with a woman  whom neither of the others had so much
reason to dislike 

mrs  dashwood was denied  but before the carriage could
turn from the house  her husband accidentally came out 
he expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor  told her
that he had been just going to call in berkeley street 
and  assuring her that fanny would be very glad to see her 
invited her to come in 

they walked up stairs in to the drawing room   nobody was there 

 fanny is in her own room  i suppose   said he    i
will go to her presently  for i am sure she will not
have the least objection in the world to seeing you   
very far from it  indeed   now especially there
cannot be  but however  you and marianne were always
great favourites   why would not marianne come    

elinor made what excuse she could for her 

 i am not sorry to see you alone   he replied 
 for i have a good deal to say to you   this living
of colonel brandon s  can it be true   has he really given
it to edward   i heard it yesterday by chance  and was
coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it  

 it is perfectly true   colonel brandon has given
the living of delaford to edward  

 really   well  this is very astonishing   no
relationship   no connection between them   and now
that livings fetch such a price   what was the value of this  

 about two hundred a year  

 very well  and for the next presentation to a living
of that value  supposing the late incumbent to have
been old and sickly  and likely to vacate it soon  he
might have got i dare say  fourteen hundred pounds 
and how came he not to have settled that matter before this
person s death   now indeed it would be too late to sell it 
but a man of colonel brandon s sense   i wonder he should
be so improvident in a point of such common  such natural 
concern   well  i am convinced that there is a vast deal
of inconsistency in almost every human character   i suppose 
however  on recollection  that the case may probably be this 
edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom
the colonel has really sold the presentation  is old enough
to take it   aye  aye  that is the fact  depend upon it  

elinor contradicted it  however  very positively 
and by relating that she had herself been employed
in conveying the offer from colonel brandon to edward 
and  therefore  must understand the terms on which it
was given  obliged him to submit to her authority 

 it is truly astonishing    he cried  after hearing
what she said   what could be the colonel s motive  

 a very simple one  to be of use to mr  ferrars  

 well  well  whatever colonel brandon may be 
edward is a very lucky man   you will not mention the matter
to fanny  however  for though i have broke it to her 
and she bears it vastly well   she will not like to hear
it much talked of  

elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing 
that she thought fanny might have borne with composure 
an acquisition of wealth to her brother  by which neither
she nor her child could be possibly impoverished 

 mrs  ferrars   added he  lowering his voice to the
tone becoming so important a subject   knows nothing
about it at present  and i believe it will be best to
keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be   
when the marriage takes place  i fear she must hear
of it all  

 but why should such precaution be used   though
it is not to be supposed that mrs  ferrars can have
the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has
money enough to live upon   for that must be quite
out of the question  yet why  upon her late behaviour 
is she supposed to feel at all   she has done with her
son  she cast him off for ever  and has made all those
over whom she had any influence  cast him off likewise 
surely  after doing so  she cannot be imagined liable
to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account  
she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him   
she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort
of a child  and yet retain the anxiety of a parent  

 ah  elinor   said john   your reasoning is very good 
but it is founded on ignorance of human nature 
when edward s unhappy match takes place  depend upon it
his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him 
and  therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that
dreadful event  must be concealed from her as much as possible 
mrs  ferrars can never forget that edward is her son  

 you surprise me  i should think it must nearly
have escaped her memory by this time  

 you wrong her exceedingly   mrs  ferrars is one
of the most affectionate mothers in the world  

elinor was silent 

 we think now    said mr  dashwood  after a short pause 
 of robert s marrying miss morton  

elinor  smiling at the grave and decisive importance
of her brother s tone  calmly replied 

 the lady  i suppose  has no choice in the affair  

 choice   how do you mean  

 i only mean that i suppose  from your manner
of speaking  it must be the same to miss morton whether
she marry edward or robert  

 certainly  there can be no difference  for robert
will now to all intents and purposes be considered
as the eldest son   and as to any thing else  they are
both very agreeable young men  i do not know that one
is superior to the other  

elinor said no more  and john was also for a short
time silent   his reflections ended thus 

 of one thing  my dear sister   kindly taking her hand 
and speaking in an awful whisper    i may assure you   
and i will do it  because i know it must gratify you 
i have good reason to think  indeed i have it from the
best authority  or i should not repeat it  for otherwise
it would be very wrong to say any thing about it  but
i have it from the very best authority  not that i ever
precisely heard mrs  ferrars say it herself  but her
daughter did  and i have it from her  that in short 
whatever objections there might be against a certain  a
certain connection  you understand me  it would have been
far preferable to her  it would not have given her half
the vexation that this does   i was exceedingly pleased
to hear that mrs  ferrars considered it in that light  
a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all 
 it would have been beyond comparison   she said   the least
evil of the two  and she would be glad to compound now
for nothing worse   but however  all that is quite out
of the question  not to be thought of or mentioned  
as to any attachment you know  it never could be  all
that is gone by   but i thought i would just tell you
of this  because i knew how much it must please you 
not that you have any reason to regret  my dear elinor   there
is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well  quite as well 
or better  perhaps  all things considered   has colonel
brandon been with you lately  

elinor had heard enough  if not to gratify her vanity 
and raise her self importance  to agitate her nerves
and fill her mind   and she was therefore glad to be
spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself 
and from the danger of hearing any thing more from
her brother  by the entrance of mr  robert ferrars 
after a few moments  chat  john dashwood  recollecting that
fanny was yet uninformed of her sister s being there 
quitted the room in quest of her  and elinor was left
to improve her acquaintance with robert  who  by the
gay unconcern  the happy self complacency of his manner
while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother s love
and liberality  to the prejudice of his banished brother 
earned only by his own dissipated course of life  and that
brother s integrity  was confirming her most unfavourable
opinion of his head and heart 

they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves 
before he began to speak of edward  for he  too  had heard
of the living  and was very inquisitive on the subject 
elinor repeated the particulars of it  as she had given them
to john  and their effect on robert  though very different 
was not less striking than it had been on him   he laughed
most immoderately   the idea of edward s being a clergyman 
and living in a small parsonage house  diverted him
beyond measure   and when to that was added the fanciful
imagery of edward reading prayers in a white surplice 
and publishing the banns of marriage between john smith and
mary brown  he could conceive nothing more ridiculous 

elinor  while she waited in silence and immovable
gravity  the conclusion of such folly  could not restrain
her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke
all the contempt it excited   it was a look  however 
very well bestowed  for it relieved her own feelings  and gave
no intelligence to him   he was recalled from wit to wisdom 
not by any reproof of her s  but by his own sensibility 

 we may treat it as a joke   said he  at last 
recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably
lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment   but  upon
my soul  it is a most serious business   poor edward 
he is ruined for ever   i am extremely sorry for it  
for i know him to be a very good hearted creature  as
well meaning a fellow perhaps  as any in the world 
you must not judge of him  miss dashwood  from your
slight acquaintance   poor edward   his manners are certainly
not the happiest in nature   but we are not all born 
you know  with the same powers   the same address   
poor fellow   to see him in a circle of strangers   
to be sure it was pitiable enough   but upon my soul 
i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom 
and i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my
life  as when it all burst forth   i could not believe it   
my mother was the first person who told me of it 
and i  feeling myself called on to act with resolution 
immediately said to her   my dear madam  i do not know
what you may intend to do on the occasion  but as for myself 
i must say  that if edward does marry this young woman 
i never will see him again   that was what i said immediately   
i was most uncommonly shocked  indeed   poor edward   he has
done for himself completely  shut himself out for ever from
all decent society   but  as i directly said to my mother 
i am not in the least surprised at it  from his style
of education  it was always to be expected   my poor mother
was half frantic  

 have you ever seen the lady  

 yes  once  while she was staying in this house 
i happened to drop in for ten minutes  and i saw
quite enough of her   the merest awkward country girl 
without style  or elegance  and almost without beauty   
i remember her perfectly   just the kind of girl i
should suppose likely to captivate poor edward 
i offered immediately  as soon as my mother related
the affair to me  to talk to him myself  and dissuade
him from the match  but it was too late then  i found 
to do any thing  for unluckily  i was not in the way
at first  and knew nothing of it till after the breach
had taken place  when it was not for me  you know 
to interfere   but had i been informed of it a few
hours earlier  i think it is most probable  that something
might have been hit on   i certainly should have represented
it to edward in a very strong light    my dear fellow  
i should have said   consider what you are doing 
you are making a most disgraceful connection  and such a one
as your family are unanimous in disapproving   i cannot
help thinking  in short  that means might have been found 
but now it is all too late   he must be starved  you know   
that is certain  absolutely starved  

he had just settled this point with great composure 
when the entrance of mrs  john dashwood put an end to the
subject 
but though she never spoke of it out of her own family 
elinor could see its influence on her mind  in the something
like confusion of countenance with which she entered 
and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself 
she even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find
that elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town 
as she had hoped to see more of them   an exertion
in which her husband  who attended her into the room 
and hung enamoured over her accents  seemed to distinguish
every thing that was most affectionate and graceful 



chapter 42


one other short call in harley street  in which elinor
received her brother s congratulations on their travelling
so far towards barton without any expense  and on colonel
brandon s being to follow them to cleveland in a day or two 
completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters
in town   and a faint invitation from fanny  to come
to norland whenever it should happen to be in their way 
which of all things was the most unlikely to occur 
with a more warm  though less public  assurance  from john
to elinor  of the promptitude with which he should come
to see her at delaford  was all that foretold any meeting
in the country 

it amused her to observe that all her friends seemed
determined to send her to delaford   a place  in which 
of all others  she would now least chuse to visit 
or wish to reside  for not only was it considered as
her future home by her brother and mrs  jennings  but even lucy 
when they parted  gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there 

very early in april  and tolerably early in the day 
the two parties from hanover square and berkeley street set
out from their respective homes  to meet  by appointment 
on the road   for the convenience of charlotte and her child 
they were to be more than two days on their journey 
and mr  palmer  travelling more expeditiously with colonel brandon 
was to join them at cleveland soon after their arrival 

marianne  few as had been her hours of comfort
in london  and eager as she had long been to quit it 
could not  when it came to the point  bid adieu to
the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed
those hopes  and that confidence  in willoughby 
which were now extinguished for ever  without great pain 
nor could she leave the place in which willoughby remained 
busy in new engagements  and new schemes  in which she
could have no share  without shedding many tears 

elinor s satisfaction  at the moment of removal 
was more positive   she had no such object for her lingering
thoughts to fix on  she left no creature behind  from whom
it would give her a moment s regret to be divided for ever 
she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution
of lucy s friendship  she was grateful for bringing
her sister away unseen by willoughby since his marriage 
and she looked forward with hope to what a few months
of tranquility at barton might do towards restoring
marianne s peace of mind  and confirming her own 

their journey was safely performed   the second
day brought them into the cherished  or the prohibited 
county of somerset  for as such was it dwelt on by turns
in marianne s imagination  and in the forenoon of the third
they drove up to cleveland 

cleveland was a spacious  modern built house 
situated on a sloping lawn   it had no park  but the
pleasure grounds were tolerably extensive  and like
every other place of the same degree of importance 
it had its open shrubbery  and closer wood walk 
a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation 
led to the front  the lawn was dotted over with timber 
the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir 
the mountain ash  and the acacia  and a thick screen of
them altogether  interspersed with tall lombardy poplars 
shut out the offices 

marianne entered the house with a heart swelling
with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty
miles from barton  and not thirty from combe magna 
and before she had been five minutes within its walls 
while the others were busily helping charlotte to show
her child to the housekeeper  she quitted it again 
stealing away through the winding shrubberies  now just
beginning to be in beauty  to gain a distant eminence 
where  from its grecian temple  her eye  wandering over
a wide tract of country to the south east  could fondly
rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon 
and fancy that from their summits combe magna might be seen 

in such moments of precious  invaluable misery 
she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at cleveland 
and as she returned by a different circuit to the house 
feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty 
of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude 
she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day
while she remained with the palmers  in the indulgence of
such solitary rambles 

she returned just in time to join the others
as they quitted the house  on an excursion through its
more immediate premises  and the rest of the morning was
easily whiled away  in lounging round the kitchen garden 
examining the bloom upon its walls  and listening to the
gardener s lamentations upon blights  in dawdling through
the green house  where the loss of her favourite plants 
unwarily exposed  and nipped by the lingering frost 
raised the laughter of charlotte   and in visiting her
poultry yard  where  in the disappointed hopes of her
dairy maid  by hens forsaking their nests  or being
stolen by a fox  or in the rapid decrease of a promising
young brood  she found fresh sources of merriment 

the morning was fine and dry  and marianne 
in her plan of employment abroad  had not calculated
for any change of weather during their stay at cleveland 
with great surprise therefore  did she find herself prevented
by a settled rain from going out again after dinner 
she had depended on a twilight walk to the grecian temple 
and perhaps all over the grounds  and an evening merely
cold or damp would not have deterred her from it 
but a heavy and settled rain even she could not fancy dry
or pleasant weather for walking 

their party was small  and the hours passed quietly away 
mrs  palmer had her child  and mrs  jennings her carpet work 
they talked of the friends they had left behind 
arranged lady middleton s engagements  and wondered
whether mr  palmer and colonel brandon would get farther
than reading that night   elinor  however little concerned
in it  joined in their discourse  and marianne  who had
the knack of finding her way in every house to the library 
however it might be avoided by the family in general 
soon procured herself a book 

nothing was wanting on mrs  palmer s side that constant
and friendly good humour could do  to make them feel
themselves welcome   the openness and heartiness of her
manner more than atoned for that want of recollection
and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms
of politeness  her kindness  recommended by so pretty
a face  was engaging  her folly  though evident
was not disgusting  because it was not conceited 
and elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh 

the two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very
late dinner  affording a pleasant enlargement of the party 
and a very welcome variety to their conversation  which a
long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low 

elinor had seen so little of mr  palmer  and in that
little had seen so much variety in his address to her
sister and herself  that she knew not what to expect
to find him in his own family   she found him  however 
perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors 
and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother 
she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion 
and only prevented from being so always  by too great
an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people
in general  as he must feel himself to be to mrs  jennings
and charlotte   for the rest of his character and habits 
they were marked  as far as elinor could perceive 
with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life 
he was nice in his eating  uncertain in his hours 
fond of his child  though affecting to slight it 
and idled away the mornings at billiards  which ought
to have been devoted to business   she liked him  however 
upon the whole  much better than she had expected  and in
her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more   
not sorry to be driven by the observation of his epicurism 
his selfishness  and his conceit  to rest with complacency
on the remembrance of edward s generous temper  simple taste 
and diffident feelings 

of edward  or at least of some of his concerns 
she now received intelligence from colonel brandon 
who had been into dorsetshire lately  and who 
treating her at once as the disinterested friend
of mr  ferrars  and the kind of confidant of himself 
talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at delaford 
described its deficiencies  and told her what he meant
to do himself towards removing them   his behaviour
to her in this  as well as in every other particular 
his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence
of only ten days  his readiness to converse with her 
and his deference for her opinion  might very well
justify mrs  jennings s persuasion of his attachment 
and would have been enough  perhaps  had not elinor still 
as from the first  believed marianne his real favourite 
to make her suspect it herself   but as it was 
such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head 
except by mrs  jennings s suggestion  and she could
not help believing herself the nicest observer of the
two   she watched his eyes  while mrs  jennings thought
only of his behaviour   and while his looks of anxious
solicitude on marianne s feeling  in her head and throat 
the beginning of a heavy cold  because unexpressed by words 
entirely escaped the latter lady s observation   she could
discover in them the quick feelings  and needless alarm
of a lover 

two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth
evenings of her being there  not merely on the dry gravel
of the shrubbery  but all over the grounds  and especially
in the most distant parts of them  where there was something
more of wildness than in the rest  where the trees were
the oldest  and the grass was the longest and wettest 
had  assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting
in her wet shoes and stockings  given marianne a cold
so violent as  though for a day or two trifled with
or denied  would force itself by increasing ailments on
the concern of every body  and the notice of herself 
prescriptions poured in from all quarters  and as usual 
were all declined   though heavy and feverish  with a pain
in her limbs  and a cough  and a sore throat  a good night s
rest was to cure her entirely  and it was with difficulty
that elinor prevailed on her  when she went to bed 
to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies 



chapter 43


marianne got up the next morning at her usual time 
to every inquiry replied that she was better  and tried to
prove herself so  by engaging in her accustomary employments 
but a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire
with a book in her hand  which she was unable to read 
or in lying  weary and languid  on a sofa  did not speak
much in favour of her amendment  and when  at last 
she went early to bed  more and more indisposed  colonel
brandon was only astonished at her sister s composure 
who  though attending and nursing her the whole day 
against marianne inclination  and forcing proper medicines
on her at night  trusted  like marianne  to the certainty
and efficacy of sleep  and felt no real alarm 

a very restless and feverish night  however 
disappointed the expectation of both  and when marianne 
after persisting in rising  confessed herself unable
to sit up  and returned voluntarily to her bed 
elinor was very ready to adopt mrs  jennings s advice 
of sending for the palmers  apothecary 

he came  examined his patient  and though encouraging
miss dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore
her sister to health  yet  by pronouncing her disorder
to have a putrid tendency  and allowing the word  infection 
to pass his lips  gave instant alarm to mrs  palmer 
on her baby s account   mrs  jennings  who had been inclined
from the first to think marianne s complaint more serious
than elinor  now looked very grave on mr  harris s report 
and confirming charlotte s fears and caution  urged the
necessity of her immediate removal with her infant 
and mr  palmer  though treating their apprehensions as idle 
found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great
to be withstood   her departure  therefore  was fixed on 
and within an hour after mr  harris s arrival  she set off 
with her little boy and his nurse  for the house of a
near relation of mr  palmer s  who lived a few miles
on the other side of bath  whither her husband promised 
at her earnest entreaty  to join her in a day or two 
and whither she was almost equally urgent with her
mother to accompany her   mrs  jennings  however  with a
kindness of heart which made elinor really love her 
declared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland
as long as marianne remained ill  and of endeavouring 
by her own attentive care  to supply to her the place
of the mother she had taken her from  and elinor found her
on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate 
desirous to share in all her fatigues  and often by her
better experience in nursing  of material use 

poor marianne  languid and low from the nature
of her malady  and feeling herself universally ill 
could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered 
and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced 
but for this unlucky illness  made every ailment severe 
for on that day they were to have begun their journey home 
and  attended the whole way by a servant of mrs  jennings 
were to have taken their mother by surprise on the
following forenoon   the little she said was all in
lamentation of this inevitable delay  though elinor tried
to raise her spirits  and make her believe  as she then
really believed herself  that it would be a very short one 

the next day produced little or no alteration in the
state of the patient  she certainly was not better  and 
except that there was no amendment  did not appear worse 
their party was now farther reduced  for mr  palmer 
though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity
and good nature  as from a dislike of appearing to be
frightened away by his wife  was persuaded at last
by colonel brandon to perform his promise of following her 
and while he was preparing to go  colonel brandon himself 
with a much greater exertion  began to talk of going
likewise   here  however  the kindness of mrs  jennings
interposed most acceptably  for to send the colonel away
while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister s
account  would be to deprive them both  she thought 
of every comfort  and therefore telling him at once
that his stay at cleveland was necessary to herself 
that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening 
while miss dashwood was above with her sister   c  she
urged him so strongly to remain  that he  who was gratifying
the first wish of his own heart by a compliance  could not
long even affect to demur  especially as mrs  jennings s
entreaty was warmly seconded by mr  palmer  who seemed
to feel a relief to himself  in leaving behind him a person
so well able to assist or advise miss dashwood in any emergence 

marianne was  of course  kept in ignorance of all
these arrangements   she knew not that she had been
the means of sending the owners of cleveland away 
in about seven days from the time of their arrival 
it gave her no surprise that she saw nothing
of mrs  palmer  and as it gave her likewise no concern 
she never mentioned her name 

two days passed away from the time of mr  palmer s departure 
and her situation continued  with little variation 
the same   mr  harris  who attended her every day 
still talked boldly of a speedy recovery  and miss dashwood
was equally sanguine  but the expectation of the others
was by no means so cheerful   mrs  jennings had determined
very early in the seizure that marianne would never
get over it  and colonel brandon  who was chiefly
of use in listening to mrs  jennings s forebodings 
was not in a state of mind to resist their influence 
he tried to reason himself out of fears  which the different
judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd 
but the many hours of each day in which he was left
entirely alone  were but too favourable for the admission
of every melancholy idea  and he could not expel from
his mind the persuasion that he should see marianne no more 

on the morning of the third day however  the gloomy
anticipations of both were almost done away  for when
mr  harris arrived  he declared his patient materially better 
her pulse was much stronger  and every symptom more favourable
than on the preceding visit   elinor  confirmed in every
pleasant hope  was all cheerfulness  rejoicing that
in her letters to her mother  she had pursued her own
judgment rather than her friend s  in making very light
of the indisposition which delayed them at cleveland 
and almost fixing on the time when marianne would be
able to travel 

but the day did not close so auspiciously as it began   
towards the evening marianne became ill again  growing
more heavy  restless  and uncomfortable than before 
her sister  however  still sanguine  was willing to
attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue
of having sat up to have her bed made  and carefully
administering the cordials prescribed  saw her  with
satisfaction  sink at last into a slumber  from which
she expected the most beneficial effects   her sleep 
though not so quiet as elinor wished to see it 
lasted a considerable time  and anxious to observe
the result of it herself  she resolved to sit with her
during the whole of it   mrs  jennings  knowing nothing
of any change in the patient  went unusually early to bed 
her maid  who was one of the principal nurses  was recreating
herself in the housekeeper s room  and elinor remained
alone with marianne 

the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed 
and her sister  who watched  with unremitting attention
her continual change of posture  and heard the frequent
but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips 
was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber 
when marianne  suddenly awakened by some accidental noise
in the house  started hastily up  and  with feverish wildness 
cried out   

 is mama coming    

 not yet   cried the other  concealing her terror 
and assisting marianne to lie down again   but she will
be here  i hope  before it is long   it is a great way 
you know  from hence to barton  

 but she must not go round by london   cried marianne 
in the same hurried manner    i shall never see her 
if she goes by london  

elinor perceived with alarm that she was not
quite herself  and  while attempting to soothe her 
eagerly felt her pulse   it was lower and quicker than ever 
and marianne  still talking wildly of mama  her alarm
increased so rapidly  as to determine her on sending
instantly for mr  harris  and despatching a messenger
to barton for her mother   to consult with colonel brandon
on the best means of effecting the latter  was a thought
which immediately followed the resolution of its performance 
and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place
by her sister  she hastened down to the drawing room 
where she knew he was generally to be found at a much
later hour than the present 

it was no time for hesitation   her fears and her
difficulties were immediately before him   her fears 
he had no courage  no confidence to attempt the removal of   
he listened to them in silent despondence   but her
difficulties were instantly obviated  for with a readiness
that seemed to speak the occasion  and the service
pre arranged in his mind  he offered himself as the
messenger who should fetch mrs  dashwood   elinor made no
resistance that was not easily overcome   she thanked him
with brief  though fervent gratitude  and while he went
to hurry off his servant with a message to mr  harris  and
an order for post horses directly  she wrote a few lines
to her mother 

the comfort of such a friend at that moment as colonel
brandon  or such a companion for her mother   how gratefully
was it felt   a companion whose judgment would guide 
whose attendance must relieve  and whose friendship might
soothe her   as far as the shock of such a summons could
be lessened to her  his presence  his manners  his assistance 
would lessen it 

he  meanwhile  whatever he might feel  acted with all
the firmness of a collected mind  made every necessary
arrangement with the utmost despatch  and calculated
with exactness the time in which she might look for
his return   not a moment was lost in delay of any kind 
the horses arrived  even before they were expected 
and colonel brandon only pressing her hand with a look
of solemnity  and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear 
hurried into the carriage   it was then about twelve
o clock  and she returned to her sister s apartment to wait
for the arrival of the apothecary  and to watch by her
the rest of the night   it was a night of almost equal
suffering to both   hour after hour passed away in sleepless
pain and delirium on marianne s side  and in the most
cruel anxiety on elinor s  before mr  harris appeared 
her apprehensions once raised  paid by their excess for all
her former security  and the servant who sat up with her 
for she would not allow mrs  jennings to be called 
only tortured her more  by hints of what her mistress
had always thought 

marianne s ideas were still  at intervals 
fixed incoherently on her mother  and whenever she
mentioned her name  it gave a pang to the heart of
poor elinor  who  reproaching herself for having trifled
with so many days of illness  and wretched for some
immediate relief  fancied that all relief might soon
be in vain  that every thing had been delayed too long 
and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving
too late to see this darling child  or to see her rational 

she was on the point of sending again for mr  harris 
or if he could not come  for some other advice 
when the former  but not till after five o clock  arrived 
his opinion  however  made some little amends for his delay 
for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant
alteration in his patient  he would not allow the danger
to be material  and talked of the relief which a fresh
mode of treatment must procure  with a confidence which 
in a lesser degree  was communicated to elinor   he promised
to call again in the course of three or four hours 
and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more
composed than he had found them 

with strong concern  and with many reproaches for not
being called to their aid  did mrs  jennings hear in the
morning of what had passed   her former apprehensions 
now with greater reason restored  left her no doubt of
the event  and though trying to speak comfort to elinor 
her conviction of her sister s danger would not allow her
to offer the comfort of hope   her heart was really grieved 
the rapid decay  the early death of a girl so young 
so lovely as marianne  must have struck a less interested
person with concern   on mrs  jennings s compassion
she had other claims   she had been for three months
her companion  was still under her care  and she was
known to have been greatly injured  and long unhappy 
the distress of her sister too  particularly a favourite 
was before her   and as for their mother  when mrs  jennings
considered that marianne might probably be to her what
charlotte was to herself  her sympathy in her sufferings
was very sincere 

mr  harris was punctual in his second visit   
but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the
last would produce   his medicines had failed   the fever
was unabated  and marianne only more quiet  not more
herself  remained in a heavy stupor   elinor  catching all 
and more than all  his fears in a moment  proposed to call
in further advice   but he judged it unnecessary  he had
still something more to try  some more fresh application 
of whose success he was as confident as the last  and his
visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached
the ear  but could not enter the heart of miss dashwood 
she was calm  except when she thought of her mother 
but she was almost hopeless  and in this state she continued
till noon  scarcely stirring from her sister s bed 
her thoughts wandering from one image of grief 
one suffering friend to another  and her spirits oppressed
to the utmost by the conversation of mrs  jennings 
who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger
of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition
which marianne s disappointment had brought on 
elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea  and it
gave fresh misery to her reflections 

about noon  however  she began  but with a caution  a
dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent 
even to her friend  to fancy  to hope she could perceive
a slight amendment in her sister s pulse   she waited 
watched  and examined it again and again   and at last 
with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness 
than all her foregoing distress  ventured to communicate
her hopes   mrs  jennings  though forced  on examination 
to acknowledge a temporary revival  tried to keep her
young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance   
and elinor  conning over every injunction of distrust 
told herself likewise not to hope   but it was too late 
hope had already entered  and feeling all its anxious flutter 
she bent over her sister to watch  she hardly knew for what 
half an hour passed away  and the favourable symptom
yet blessed her   others even arose to confirm it 
her breath  her skin  her lips  all flattered elinor
with signs of amendment  and marianne fixed her eyes on
her with a rational  though languid  gaze   anxiety and
hope now oppressed her in equal degrees  and left her no
moment of tranquillity till the arrival of mr  harris at
four o clock   when his assurances  his felicitations on
a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation 
gave her confidence  comfort  and tears of joy 

marianne was in every respect materially better 
and he declared her entirely out of danger   mrs  jennings 
perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her
forebodings which had been found in their late alarm 
allowed herself to trust in his judgment  and admitted 
with unfeigned joy  and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness 
the probability of an entire recovery 

elinor could not be cheerful   her joy was of a
different kind  and led to any thing rather than to gaiety 
marianne restored to life  health  friends  and to her
doting mother  was an idea to fill her heart with sensations
of exquisite comfort  and expand it in fervent gratitude   
but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy  no words 
no smiles   all within elinor s breast was satisfaction 
silent and strong 

she continued by the side of her sister  with little
intermission the whole afternoon  calming every fear 
satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits 
supplying every succour  and watching almost every look and
every breath   the possibility of a relapse would of course 
in some moments  occur to remind her of what anxiety was  
but when she saw  on her frequent and minute examination 
that every symptom of recovery continued  and saw marianne
at six o clock sink into a quiet  steady  and to all
appearance comfortable  sleep  she silenced every doubt 

the time was now drawing on  when colonel brandon
might be expected back   at ten o clock  she trusted 
or at least not much later her mother would be relieved
from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be
travelling towards them   the colonel  too   perhaps scarcely
less an object of pity   oh   how slow was the progress
of time which yet kept them in ignorance 

at seven o clock  leaving marianne still sweetly asleep 
she joined mrs  jennings in the drawing room to tea 
of breakfast she had been kept by her fears  and of
dinner by their sudden reverse  from eating much   
and the present refreshment  therefore  with such feelings
of content as she brought to it  was particularly welcome 
mrs  jennings would have persuaded her  at its conclusion 
to take some rest before her mother s arrival  and allow her to
take her place by marianne  but elinor had no sense of fatigue 
no capability of sleep at that moment about her  and she was
not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant 
mrs  jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the
sick chamber  to satisfy herself that all continued right 
left her there again to her charge and her thoughts 
and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep 

the night was cold and stormy   the wind roared
round the house  and the rain beat against the windows 
but elinor  all happiness within  regarded it not 
marianne slept through every blast  and the travellers  
they had a rich reward in store  for every present inconvenience 

the clock struck eight   had it been ten 
elinor would have been convinced that at that moment
she heard a carriage driving up to the house 
and so strong was the persuasion that she did  in spite
of the almost impossibility of their being already come 
that she moved into the adjoining dressing closet and
opened a window shutter  to be satisfied of the truth 
she instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her 
the flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view 
by their uncertain light she thought she could discern it
to be drawn by four horses  and this  while it told the
excess of her poor mother s alarm  gave some explanation
to such unexpected rapidity 

never in her life had elinor found it so difficult
to be calm  as at that moment   the knowledge of what her
mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door  
of her doubt  her dread  perhaps her despair   and
of what she had to tell   with such knowledge it was
impossible to be calm   all that remained to be done
was to be speedy  and  therefore staying only till
she could leave mrs  jennings s maid with her sister 
she hurried down stairs 

the bustle in the vestibule  as she passed along
an inner lobby  assured her that they were already
in the house   she rushed to the drawing room   she
entered it   and saw only willoughby 



chapter 44


elinor  starting back with a look of horror at
the sight of him  obeyed the first impulse of her heart
in turning instantly to quit the room  and her hand
was already on the lock  when its action was suspended
by his hastily advancing  and saying  in a voice rather
of command than supplication 

 miss dashwood  for half an hour  for ten minutes  
i entreat you to stay  

 no  sir   she replied with firmness   i shall not stay 
your business cannot be with me   the servants  i suppose 
forgot to tell you that mr  palmer was not in the house  

 had they told me   he cried with vehemence 
 that mr  palmer and all his relations were at the devil 
it would not have turned me from the door   my business
is with you  and only you  

 with me    in the utmost amazement   well  sir   
be quick  and if you can  less violent  

 sit down  and i will be both  

she hesitated  she knew not what to do   the possibility
of colonel brandon s arriving and finding her there 
came across her   but she had promised to hear him 
and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged 
after a moment s recollection  therefore  concluding that
prudence required dispatch  and that her acquiescence would
best promote it  she walked silently towards the table 
and sat down   he took the opposite chair  and for half
a minute not a word was said by either 

 pray be quick  sir    said elinor  impatiently   
 i have no time to spare  

he was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation 
and seemed not to hear her 

 your sister   said he  with abruptness  a moment
afterwards   is out of danger   i heard it from the servant 
god be praised   but is it true  is it really true  

elinor would not speak   he repeated the inquiry with
yet greater eagerness 

 for god s sake tell me  is she out of danger  or is she not  

 we hope she is  

he rose up  and walked across the room 

 had i known as much half an hour ago  but
since i am here    speaking with a forced vivacity as he
returned to his seat   what does it signify   for once 
miss dashwood  it will be the last time  perhaps  let us
be cheerful together   i am in a fine mood for gaiety   
tell me honestly   a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks  
 do you think me most a knave or a fool  

elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever 
she began to think that be must be in liquor   the
strangeness of such a visit  and of such manners 
seemed no otherwise intelligible  and with this impression
she immediately rose  saying 

 mr  willoughby  i advise you at present to return
to combe  i am not at leisure to remain with you longer   
whatever your business may be with me  will it be better
recollected and explained to morrow  

 i understand you   he replied  with an expressive smile 
and a voice perfectly calm   yes  i am very drunk   
a pint of porter with my cold beef at marlborough was
enough to over set me  

 at marlborough    cried elinor  more and more at
a loss to understand what he would be at 

 yes   i left london this morning at eight o clock 
and the only ten minutes i have spent out of my chaise
since that time procured me a nuncheon at marlborough  

the steadiness of his manner  and the intelligence
of his eye as he spoke  convincing elinor  that whatever
other unpardonable folly might bring him to cleveland 
he was not brought there by intoxication  she said 
after a moment s recollection 

 mr  willoughby  you ought to feel  and i certainly
do  that after what has passed  your coming here in
this manner  and forcing yourself upon my notice 
requires a very particular excuse   what is it 
that you mean by it    

 i mean    said he  with serious energy   if i can 
to make you hate me one degree less than you do now 
i mean to offer some kind of explanation  some kind
of apology  for the past  to open my whole heart to you 
and by convincing you  that though i have been always
a blockhead  i have not been always a rascal  to obtain
something like forgiveness from ma  from your sister  

 is this the real reason of your coming  

 upon my soul it is    was his answer  with a warmth
which brought all the former willoughby to her remembrance 
and in spite of herself made her think him sincere 

 if that is all  you may be satisfied already   
for marianne does  she has long forgiven you  

 has she    he cried  in the same eager tone   
 then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it 
but she shall forgive me again  and on more reasonable
grounds   now will you listen to me  

elinor bowed her assent 

 i do not know   said he  after a pause of expectation
on her side  and thoughtfulness on his own    how you
may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister 
or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me   
perhaps you will hardly think the better of me   it is
worth the trial however  and you shall hear every thing 
when i first became intimate in your family  i had no
other intention  no other view in the acquaintance
than to pass my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain
in devonshire  more pleasantly than i had ever done before 
your sister s lovely person and interesting manners
could not but please me  and her behaviour to me almost
from the first  was of a kind  it is astonishing 
when i reflect on what it was  and what she was  that my
heart should have been so insensible   but at first
i must confess  my vanity only was elevated by it 
careless of her happiness  thinking only of my own amusement 
giving way to feelings which i had always been too much
in the habit of indulging  i endeavoured  by every means
in my power  to make myself pleasing to her  without any
design of returning her affection  

miss dashwood  at this point  turning her eyes on him
with the most angry contempt  stopped him  by saying 

 it is hardly worth while  mr  willoughby 
for you to relate  or for me to listen any longer 
such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing   
do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on
the subject  

 i insist on you hearing the whole of it   he replied 
 my fortune was never large  and i had always been expensive 
always in the habit of associating with people of better
income than myself   every year since my coming of age 
or even before  i believe  had added to my debts  and though
the death of my old cousin  mrs  smith  was to set me free 
yet that event being uncertain  and possibly far distant 
it had been for some time my intention to re establish my
circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune   to attach
myself to your sister  therefore  was not a thing to be
thought of   and with a meanness  selfishness  cruelty  
which no indignant  no contemptuous look  even of yours 
miss dashwood  can ever reprobate too much  i was acting
in this manner  trying to engage her regard  without a
thought of returning it   but one thing may be said
for me  even in that horrid state of selfish vanity 
i did not know the extent of the injury i meditated 
because i did not then know what it was to love 
but have i ever known it   well may it be doubted  for  had i
really loved  could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity 
to avarice   or  what is more  could i have sacrificed hers   
but i have done it   to avoid a comparative poverty 
which her affection and her society would have deprived
of all its horrors  i have  by raising myself to affluence 
lost every thing that could make it a blessing  

 you did then   said elinor  a little softened 
 believe yourself at one time attached to her  

 to have resisted such attractions  to have withstood
such tenderness   is there a man on earth who could have
done it   yes  i found myself  by insensible degrees 
sincerely fond of her  and the happiest hours of my life
were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions
were strictly honourable  and my feelings blameless 
even then  however  when fully determined on paying
my addresses to her  i allowed myself most improperly
to put off  from day to day  the moment of doing it 
from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement
while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed 
i will not reason here  nor will i stop for you to expatiate
on the absurdity  and the worse than absurdity  of scrupling
to engage my faith where my honour was already bound 
the event has proved  that i was a cunning fool 
providing with great circumspection for a possible
opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched
for ever   at last  however  my resolution was taken 
and i had determined  as soon as i could engage her alone 
to justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her 
and openly assure her of an affection which i had already
taken such pains to display   but in the interim  in the
interim of the very few hours that were to pass  before i
could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private  
a circumstance occurred  an unlucky circumstance  to ruin
all my resolution  and with it all my comfort   a discovery
took place    here he hesitated and looked down    mrs  smith
had somehow or other been informed  i imagine by some
distant relation  whose interest it was to deprive me of
her favour  of an affair  a connection  but i need not
explain myself farther   he added  looking at her with an
heightened colour and an enquiring eye   your particular
intimacy  you have probably heard the whole story long ago  

 i have   returned elinor  colouring likewise 
and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him 
 i have heard it all   and how you will explain away any
part of your guilt in that dreadful business  i confess
is beyond my comprehension  

 remember   cried willoughby   from whom you received
the account   could it be an impartial one   i acknowledge
that her situation and her character ought to have been
respected by me   i do not mean to justify myself  but at
the same time cannot leave you to suppose that i have nothing
to urge  that because she was injured she was irreproachable 
and because i was a libertine  she must be a saint 
if the violence of her passions  the weakness of her
understanding  i do not mean  however  to defend myself 
her affection for me deserved better treatment  and i often 
with great self reproach  recall the tenderness which 
for a very short time  had the power of creating any return 
i wish  i heartily wish it had never been   but i have injured
more than herself  and i have injured one  whose affection
for me   may i say it   was scarcely less warm than hers 
and whose mind  oh  how infinitely superior    

 your indifference  however  towards that unfortunate
girl  i must say it  unpleasant to me as the discussion
of such a subject may well be  your indifference is no
apology for your cruel neglect of her   do not think yourself
excused by any weakness  any natural defect of understanding
on her side  in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours 
you must have known  that while you were enjoying yourself
in devonshire pursuing fresh schemes  always gay 
always happy  she was reduced to the extremest indigence  

 but  upon my soul  i did not know it   he warmly
replied   i did not recollect that i had omitted to give
her my direction  and common sense might have told her
how to find it out  

 well  sir  and what said mrs  smith  

 she taxed me with the offence at once  and my confusion
may be guessed   the purity of her life  the formality
of her notions  her ignorance of the world  every thing
was against me   the matter itself i could not deny 
and vain was every endeavour to soften it   she was
previously disposed  i believe  to doubt the morality of my
conduct in general  and was moreover discontented with
the very little attention  the very little portion of my
time that i had bestowed on her  in my present visit 
in short  it ended in a total breach   by one measure i
might have saved myself   in the height of her morality 
good woman  she offered to forgive the past  if i would
marry eliza   that could not be  and i was formally
dismissed from her favour and her house   the night
following this affair  i was to go the next morning  
was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct
should be   the struggle was great  but it ended too soon 
my affection for marianne  my thorough conviction of her
attachment to me  it was all insufficient to outweigh
that dread of poverty  or get the better of those false
ideas of the necessity of riches  which i was naturally
inclined to feel  and expensive society had increased 
i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife 
if i chose to address her  and i persuaded myself to think
that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do 
a heavy scene however awaited me  before i could leave
devonshire   i was engaged to dine with you on that very day 
some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking
this engagement   but whether i should write this apology 
or deliver it in person  was a point of long debate 
to see marianne  i felt  would be dreadful  and i even doubted
whether i could see her again  and keep to my resolution 
in that point  however  i undervalued my own magnanimity 
as the event declared  for i went  i saw her  and saw
her miserable  and left her miserable  and left her hoping
never to see her again  

 why did you call  mr  willoughby   said elinor 
reproachfully   a note would have answered every purpose   
why was it necessary to call  

 it was necessary to my own pride   i could not bear
to leave the country in a manner that might lead you 
or the rest of the neighbourhood  to suspect any part
of what had really passed between mrs  smith and myself  
and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage 
in my way to honiton   the sight of your dear sister 
however  was really dreadful  and  to heighten the matter 
i found her alone   you were all gone i do not know where 
i had left her only the evening before  so fully 
so firmly resolved within my self on doing right 
a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever 
and i remember how happy  how gay were my spirits  as i
walked from the cottage to allenham  satisfied with myself 
delighted with every body   but in this  our last interview
of friendship  i approached her with a sense of guilt
that almost took from me the power of dissembling 
her sorrow  her disappointment  her deep regret  when i told
her that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately  i
never shall forget it  united too with such reliance 
such confidence in me   oh  god   what a hard hearted
rascal i was  

they were both silent for a few moments 
elinor first spoke 

 did you tell her that you should soon return  

 i do not know what i told her   he replied  impatiently 
 less than was due to the past  beyond a doubt  and in all
likelihood much more than was justified by the future 
i cannot think of it   it won t do   then came your dear mother
to torture me farther  with all her kindness and confidence 
thank heaven  it did torture me   i was miserable 
miss dashwood  you cannot have an idea of the comfort it
gives me to look back on my own misery   i owe such a grudge
to myself for the stupid  rascally folly of my own heart 
that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and
exultation to me now   well  i went  left all that i loved 
and went to those to whom  at best  i was only indifferent 
my journey to town  travelling with my own horses 
and therefore so tediously  no creature to speak to  my
own reflections so cheerful  when i looked forward
every thing so inviting   when i looked back at barton 
the picture so soothing   oh  it was a blessed journey  

he stopped 

 well  sir   said elinor  who  though pitying him 
grew impatient for his departure   and this is all  

 ah   no   have you forgot what passed in town   
that infamous letter  did she shew it you  

 yes  i saw every note that passed  

 when the first of hers reached me  as it immediately did 
for i was in town the whole time   what i felt is  
in the common phrase  not to be expressed  in a more
simple one  perhaps too simple to raise any emotion  
my feelings were very  very painful   every line  every word
was  in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer 
were she here  would forbid  a dagger to my heart 
to know that marianne was in town was  in the same language  
a thunderbolt   thunderbolts and daggers   what a reproof
would she have given me   her taste  her opinions  i believe
they are better known to me than my own   and i am sure
they are dearer  

elinor s heart  which had undergone many changes
in the course of this extraordinary conversation 
was now softened again   yet she felt it her duty to check
such ideas in her companion as the last 

 this is not right  mr  willoughby   remember that
you are married   relate only what in your conscience
you think necessary for me to hear  

 marianne s note  by assuring me that i was still
as dear to her as in former days  that in spite of the many 
many weeks we had been separated  she was as constant
in her own feelings  and as full of faith in the constancy
of mine as ever  awakened all my remorse   i say awakened 
because time and london  business and dissipation 
had in some measure quieted it  and i had been growing
a fine hardened villain  fancying myself indifferent to her 
and chusing to fancy that she too must have become
indifferent to me  talking to myself of our past attachment
as a mere idle  trifling business  shrugging up my shoulders
in proof of its being so  and silencing every reproach 
overcoming every scruple  by secretly saying now and then 
 i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married    
but this note made me know myself better   i felt that
she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman
in the world  and that i was using her infamously 
but every thing was then just settled between miss grey
and me   to retreat was impossible   all that i had to do 
was to avoid you both   i sent no answer to marianne 
intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice 
and for some time i was even determined not to call in
berkeley street   but at last  judging it wiser to affect
the air of a cool  common acquaintance than anything else 
i watched you all safely out of the house one morning 
and left my name  

 watched us out of the house  

 even so   you would be surprised to hear how often
i watched you  how often i was on the point of falling
in with you   i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight 
as the carriage drove by   lodging as i did in bond street 
there was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse
of one or other of you  and nothing but the most constant
watchfulness on my side  a most invariably prevailing
desire to keep out of your sight  could have separated us
so long   i avoided the middletons as much as possible 
as well as everybody else who was likely to prove
an acquaintance in common   not aware of their being
in town  however  i blundered on sir john  i believe 
the first day of his coming  and the day after i had called
at mrs  jennings s   he asked me to a party  a dance at his
house in the evening   had he not told me as an inducement
that you and your sister were to be there  i should have
felt it too certain a thing  to trust myself near him 
the next morning brought another short note from marianne  
still affectionate  open  artless  confiding  everything
that could make my conduct most hateful   i could not
answer it   i tried  but could not frame a sentence 
but i thought of her  i believe  every moment of the day 
if you can pity me  miss dashwood  pity my situation as it
was then   with my head and heart full of your sister 
i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman   those
three or four weeks were worse than all   well  at last 
as i need not tell you  you were forced on me  and what a
sweet figure i cut   what an evening of agony it was   
marianne  beautiful as an angel on one side  calling me
willoughby in such a tone   oh  god   holding out her hand
to me  asking me for an explanation  with those bewitching
eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face   and
sophia  jealous as the devil on the other hand  looking
all that was  well  it does not signify  it is over now   
such an evening   i ran away from you all as soon as i could 
but not before i had seen marianne s sweet face as white
as death   that was the last  last look i ever had of her   
the last manner in which she appeared to me   it was a horrid
sight   yet when i thought of her to day as really dying 
it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew
exactly how she would appear to those  who saw her last
in this world   she was before me  constantly before me 
as i travelled  in the same look and hue  

a short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded 
willoughby first rousing himself  broke it thus 

 well  let me make haste and be gone   your sister
is certainly better  certainly out of danger  

 we are assured of it  

 your poor mother  too   doting on marianne  

 but the letter  mr  willoughby  your own letter 
have you any thing to say about that  

 yes  yes  that in particular   your sister
wrote to me again  you know  the very next morning 
you saw what she said   i was breakfasting at the
ellisons   and her letter  with some others  was brought
to me there from my lodgings   it happened to catch
sophia s eye before it caught mine  and its size 
the elegance of the paper  the hand writing altogether 
immediately gave her a suspicion   some vague report had
reached her before of my attachment to some young lady
in devonshire  and what had passed within her observation
the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was 
and made her more jealous than ever   affecting that air
of playfulness  therefore  which is delightful in a woman
one loves  she opened the letter directly  and read
its contents   she was well paid for her impudence 
she read what made her wretched   her wretchedness i could
have borne  but her passion  her malice  at all events it
must be appeased   and  in short  what do you think of my
wife s style of letter writing   delicate  tender  
truly feminine  was it not  

 your wife   the letter was in your own hand writing  

 yes  but i had only the credit of servilely copying
such sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to 
the original was all her own  her own happy thoughts
and gentle diction   but what could i do   we were engaged 
every thing in preparation  the day almost fixed  but i am
talking like a fool   preparation   day   in honest words 
her money was necessary to me  and in a situation like
mine  any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture 
and after all  what did it signify to my character
in the opinion of marianne and her friends  in what language
my answer was couched   it must have been only to one end 
my business was to declare myself a scoundrel  and whether
i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance   
 i am ruined for ever in their opinion    said i to
myself   i am shut out for ever from their society 
they already think me an unprincipled fellow  this letter
will only make them think me a blackguard one   such were
my reasonings  as  in a sort of desperate carelessness 
i copied my wife s words  and parted with the last relics
of marianne   her three notes  unluckily they were all
in my pocketbook  or i should have denied their existence 
and hoarded them for ever  i was forced to put them up 
and could not even kiss them   and the lock of hair  that too
i had always carried about me in the same pocket book 
which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating
virulence   the dear lock  all  every memento was torn from me  

 you are very wrong  mr  willoughby  very blamable  
said elinor  while her voice  in spite of herself 
betrayed her compassionate emotion   you ought not to speak
in this way  either of mrs  willoughby or my sister 
you had made your own choice   it was not forced on you 
your wife has a claim to your politeness  to your respect 
at least   she must be attached to you  or she would not
have married you   to treat her with unkindness  to speak
of her slightingly is no atonement to marianne  nor can i
suppose it a relief to your own conscience  

 do not talk to me of my wife   said he with a heavy sigh   
 she does not deserve your compassion   she knew i had no
regard for her when we married   well  married we were 
and came down to combe magna to be happy  and afterwards
returned to town to be gay   and now do you pity me 
miss dashwood   or have i said all this to no purpose   
am i  be it only one degree  am i less guilty in your opinion
than i was before   my intentions were not always wrong 
have i explained away any part of my guilt  

 yes  you have certainly removed something  a little   
you have proved yourself  on the whole  less faulty than
i had believed you   you have proved your heart less wicked 
much less wicked   but i hardly know  the misery that
you have inflicted  i hardly know what could have made
it worse  

 will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered 
what i have been telling you   let me be a little lightened
too in her opinion as well as in yours   you tell me that
she has forgiven me already   let me be able to fancy that
a better knowledge of my heart  and of my present feelings 
will draw from her a more spontaneous  more natural  more
gentle  less dignified  forgiveness   tell her of my misery
and my penitence  tell her that my heart was never inconstant
to her  and if you will  that at this moment she is dearer
to me than ever  

 i will tell her all that is necessary to what may
comparatively be called  your justification   but you have
not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now 
nor how you heard of her illness  

 last night  in drury lane lobby  i ran against sir
john middleton  and when he saw who i was  for the first
time these two months  he spoke to me   that he had cut
me ever since my marriage  i had seen without surprise
or resentment   now  however  his good natured  honest 
stupid soul  full of indignation against me  and concern
for your sister  could not resist the temptation of telling
me what he knew ought to  though probably he did not
think it would  vex me horridly   as bluntly as he could
speak it  therefore  he told me that marianne dashwood
was dying of a putrid fever at cleveland  a letter that
morning received from mrs  jennings declared her danger
most imminent  the palmers are all gone off in a fright 
 c   i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself
off as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john 
his heart was softened in seeing mine suffer  and so much
of his ill will was done away  that when we parted 
he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an
old promise about a pointer puppy   what i felt on hearing
that your sister was dying  and dying too  believing me
the greatest villain upon earth  scorning  hating me
in her latest moments  for how could i tell what horrid
projects might not have been imputed   one person i
was sure would represent me as capable of any thing  
what i felt was dreadful   my resolution was soon made 
and at eight o clock this morning i was in my carriage 
now you know all  

elinor made no answer   her thoughts were silently fixed
on the irreparable injury which too early an independence
and its consequent habits of idleness  dissipation  and luxury 
had made in the mind  the character  the happiness 
of a man who  to every advantage of person and talents 
united a disposition naturally open and honest  and a
feeling  affectionate temper   the world had made him
extravagant and vain  extravagance and vanity had made him
cold hearted and selfish   vanity  while seeking its own
guilty triumph at the expense of another  had involved
him in a real attachment  which extravagance  or at least
its offspring  necessity  had required to be sacrificed 
each faulty propensity in leading him to evil  had led
him likewise to punishment   the attachment  from which
against honour  against feeling  against every better interest
he had outwardly torn himself  now  when no longer allowable 
governed every thought  and the connection  for the sake
of which he had  with little scruple  left her sister
to misery  was likely to prove a source of unhappiness
to himself of a far more incurable nature   from a reverie
of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes
by willoughby  who  rousing himself from a reverie at least
equally painful  started up in preparation for going  and said  

 there is no use in staying here  i must be off  

 are you going back to town  

 no  to combe magna   i have business there 
from thence to town in a day or two   good bye  

he held out his hand   she could not refuse to give
him hers s   he pressed it with affection 

 and you do think something better of me than
you did    said he  letting it fall  and leaning against
the mantel piece as if forgetting he was to go 

elinor assured him that she did   that she forgave 
pitied  wished him well  was even interested in his
happiness  and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour
most likely to promote it   his answer was not very encouraging 

 as to that   said he   i must rub through the world
as well as i can   domestic happiness is out of the question 
if  however  i am allowed to think that you and yours feel
an interest in my fate and actions  it may be the means  it
may put me on my guard  at least  it may be something to
live for   marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever 
were i even by any blessed chance at liberty again   

elinor stopped him with a reproof 

 well    he replied   once more good bye  i shall
now go away and live in dread of one event  

 what do you mean  

 your sister s marriage  

 you are very wrong   she can never be more lost
to you than she is now  

 but she will be gained by some one else   and if
that some one should be the very he whom  of all others 
i could least bear  but i will not stay to rob myself
of all your compassionate goodwill  by shewing
that where i have most injured i can least forgive 
good bye   god bless you  

and with these words  he almost ran out of the room 



chapter 45


elinor  for some time after he left her  for some time
even after the sound of his carriage had died away  remained
too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas  widely differing in
themselves  but of which sadness was the general result 
to think even of her sister 

willoughby  he  whom only half an hour ago she had
abhorred as the most worthless of men  willoughby  in spite
of all his faults  excited a degree of commiseration
for the sufferings produced by them  which made her
think of him as now separated for ever from her family 
with a tenderness  a regret  rather in proportion  as she
soon acknowledged within herself  to his wishes than to
his merits   she felt that his influence over her mind
was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason
to have weight  by that person of uncommon attraction 
that open  affectionate  and lively manner which it
was no merit to possess  and by that still ardent love
for marianne  which it was not even innocent to indulge 
but she felt that it was so  long  long before she could
feel his influence less 

when at last she returned to the unconscious marianne 
she found her just awaking  refreshed by so long and sweet
a sleep to the extent of her hopes   elinor s heart was full 
the past  the present  the future  willoughby s visit 
marianne s safety  and her mother s expected arrival 
threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits
which kept off every indication of fatigue  and made
her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister 
short was the time  however  in which that fear could
affect her  for within half an hour after willoughby s
leaving the house  she was again called down stairs
by the sound of another carriage   eager to save her
mother from every unnecessary moment s horrible suspense 
she ran immediately into the hall  and reached the outward
door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it 

mrs  dashwood  whose terror as they drew near the
house had produced almost the conviction of marianne s
being no more  had no voice to inquire after her 
no voice even for elinor  but she  waiting neither for
salutation nor inquiry  instantly gave the joyful relief   
and her mother  catching it with all her usual warmth 
was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness  as she
had been before by her fears   she was supported into
the drawing room between her daughter and her friend   
and there  shedding tears of joy  though still unable
to speak  embraced elinor again and again  turning from her
at intervals to press colonel brandon s hand  with a look
which spoke at once her gratitude  and her conviction
of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment 
he shared it  however  in a silence even greater than her own 

as soon as mrs  dashwood had recovered herself 
to see marianne was her first desire  and in two minutes she
was with her beloved child  rendered dearer to her than ever
by absence  unhappiness  and danger   elinor s delight 
as she saw what each felt in the meeting  was only checked
by an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther sleep   
but mrs  dashwood could be calm  could be even prudent 
when the life of a child was at stake  and marianne 
satisfied in knowing her mother was near her  and conscious
of being too weak for conversation  submitted readily to the
silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her 
mrs  dashwood would sit up with her all night  and elinor 
in compliance with her mother s entreaty  went to bed 
but the rest  which one night entirely sleepless 
and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to
make requisite  was kept off by irritation of spirits 
willoughby   poor willoughby   as she now allowed
herself to call him  was constantly in her thoughts  she
would not but have heard his vindication for the world 
and now blamed  now acquitted herself for having judged him
so harshly before   but her promise of relating it to her
sister was invariably painful   she dreaded the performance
of it  dreaded what its effect on marianne might be 
doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever
be happy with another  and for a moment wished willoughby
a widower   then  remembering colonel brandon  reproved herself 
felt that to his sufferings and his constancy far more
than to his rival s  the reward of her sister was due 
and wished any thing rather than mrs  willoughby s death 

the shock of colonel brandon s errand at barton had been
much softened to mrs  dashwood by her own previous alarm 
for so great was her uneasiness about marianne  that she
had already determined to set out for cleveland on that
very day  without waiting for any further intelligence 
and had so far settled her journey before his arrival 
that the careys were then expected every moment to fetch
margaret away  as her mother was unwilling to take her
where there might be infection 

marianne continued to mend every day  and the brilliant
cheerfulness of mrs  dashwood s looks and spirits proved
her to be  as she repeatedly declared herself  one of
the happiest women in the world   elinor could not hear
the declaration  nor witness its proofs without sometimes
wondering whether her mother ever recollected edward 
but mrs  dashwood  trusting to the temperate account
of her own disappointment which elinor had sent her 
was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only
of what would increase it   marianne was restored to her
from a danger in which  as she now began to feel 
her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate
attachment to willoughby  had contributed to place her   
and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy
unthought of by elinor   it was thus imparted to her 
as soon as any opportunity of private conference
between them occurred 

 at last we are alone   my elinor  you do not yet
know all my happiness   colonel brandon loves marianne 
he has told me so himself  

her daughter  feeling by turns both pleased and pained 
surprised and not surprised  was all silent attention 

 you are never like me  dear elinor  or i should
wonder at your composure now   had i sat down to wish
for any possible good to my family  i should have fixed
on colonel brandon s marrying one of you as the object
most desirable   and i believe marianne will be the most
happy with him of the two  

elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so 
because satisfied that none founded on an impartial
consideration of their age  characters  or feelings 
could be given   but her mother must always be carried
away by her imagination on any interesting subject 
and therefore instead of an inquiry  she passed it off with a
smile 

 he opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled 
it came out quite unawares  quite undesignedly   i  you may
well believe  could talk of nothing but my child   he could
not conceal his distress  i saw that it equalled my own 
and he perhaps  thinking that mere friendship  as the world
now goes  would not justify so warm a sympathy  or rather 
not thinking at all  i suppose  giving way to irresistible
feelings  made me acquainted with his earnest  tender  constant 
affection for marianne   he has loved her  my elinor  ever since
the first moment of seeing her  

here  however  elinor perceived   not the language 
not the professions of colonel brandon  but the natural
embellishments of her mother s active fancy  which fashioned
every thing delightful to her as it chose 

 his regard for her  infinitely surpassing anything
that willoughby ever felt or feigned  as much more warm 
as more sincere or constant  which ever we are to call it  
has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear marianne s
unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man   and
without selfishness  without encouraging a hope   could
he have seen her happy with another  such a noble mind   
such openness  such sincerity   no one can be deceived
in him  

 colonel brandon s character   said elinor 
 as an excellent man  is well established  

 i know it is   replied her mother seriously   or
after such a warning  i should be the last to encourage
such affection  or even to be pleased by it   but his coming
for me as he did  with such active  such ready friendship 
is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men  

 his character  however   answered elinor   does not rest
on one act of kindness  to which his affection for marianne 
were humanity out of the case  would have prompted him 
to mrs  jennings  to the middletons  he has been long
and intimately known  they equally love and respect him 
and even my own knowledge of him  though lately acquired 
is very considerable  and so highly do i value and esteem him 
that if marianne can be happy with him  i shall be as ready
as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing
to us in the world   what answer did you give him   did you
allow him to hope  

 oh  my love  i could not then talk of hope to him
or to myself   marianne might at that moment be dying 
but he did not ask for hope or encouragement   his was
an involuntary confidence  an irrepressible effusion
to a soothing friend  not an application to a parent 
yet after a time i did say  for at first i was quite
overcome  that if she lived  as i trusted she might 
my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage 
and since our arrival  since our delightful security 
i have repeated it to him more fully  have given him every
encouragement in my power   time  a very little time 
i tell him  will do everything   marianne s heart is
not to be wasted for ever on such a man as willoughby   
his own merits must soon secure it  

 to judge from the colonel s spirits  however 
you have not yet made him equally sanguine  

 no   he thinks marianne s affection too deeply
rooted for any change in it under a great length of time 
and even supposing her heart again free  is too diffident
of himself to believe  that with such a difference of age
and disposition he could ever attach her   there  however 
he is quite mistaken   his age is only so much beyond
hers as to be an advantage  as to make his character and
principles fixed   and his disposition  i am well convinced 
is exactly the very one to make your sister happy 
and his person  his manners too  are all in his favour 
my partiality does not blind me  he certainly is not
so handsome as willoughby  but at the same time 
there is something much more pleasing in his countenance   
there was always a something   if you remember   in willoughby s
eyes at times  which i did not like  

elinor could not remember it   but her mother 
without waiting for her assent  continued 

 and his manners  the colonel s manners are not only
more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were  but they
are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching
to marianne   their gentleness  their genuine attention
to other people  and their manly unstudied simplicity
is much more accordant with her real disposition  than
the liveliness  often artificial  and often ill timed
of the other   i am very sure myself  that had willoughby
turned out as really amiable  as he has proved himself
the contrary  marianne would yet never have been so happy
with him  as she will be with colonel brandon  

she paused   her daughter could not quite agree
with her  but her dissent was not heard  and therefore
gave no offence 

 at delaford  she will be within an easy distance of me  
added mrs  dashwood   even if i remain at barton  and in all
probability   for i hear it is a large village   indeed there
certainly must be some small house or cottage close by 
that would suit us quite as well as our present situation  

poor elinor   here was a new scheme for getting
her to delaford   but her spirit was stubborn 

 his fortune too   for at my time of life you know 
everybody cares about that   and though i neither know
nor desire to know  what it really is  i am sure it must be
a good one  

here they were interrupted by the entrance of a
third person  and elinor withdrew to think it all over
in private  to wish success to her friend  and yet
in wishing it  to feel a pang for willoughby 



chapter 46


marianne s illness  though weakening in its kind 
had not been long enough to make her recovery slow 
and with youth  natural strength  and her mother s presence
in aid  it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove 
within four days after the arrival of the latter 
into mrs  palmer s dressing room   when there  at her own
particular request  for she was impatient to pour forth
her thanks to him for fetching her mother  colonel brandon
was invited to visit her 

his emotion on entering the room  in seeing her altered
looks  and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately
held out to him  was such  as  in elinor s conjecture 
must arise from something more than his affection for marianne 
or the consciousness of its being known to others 
and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying
complexion as he looked at her sister  the probable
recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind 
brought back by that resemblance between marianne and eliza
already acknowledged  and now strengthened by the hollow eye 
the sickly skin  the posture of reclining weakness 
and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation 

mrs  dashwood  not less watchful of what passed than
her daughter  but with a mind very differently influenced 
and therefore watching to very different effect 
saw nothing in the colonel s behaviour but what arose
from the most simple and self evident sensations  while in
the actions and words of marianne she persuaded herself
to think that something more than gratitude already dawned 

at the end of another day or two  marianne growing
visibly stronger every twelve hours  mrs  dashwood 
urged equally by her own and her daughter s wishes 
began to talk of removing to barton   on her measures
depended those of her two friends  mrs  jennings could
not quit cleveland during the dashwoods  stay  and colonel
brandon was soon brought  by their united request 
to consider his own abode there as equally determinate 
if not equally indispensable   at his and mrs  jennings s
united request in return  mrs  dashwood was prevailed
on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back 
for the better accommodation of her sick child  and the colonel 
at the joint invitation of mrs  dashwood and mrs  jennings 
whose active good nature made her friendly and hospitable
for other people as well as herself  engaged with pleasure
to redeem it by a visit at the cottage  in the course
of a few weeks 

the day of separation and departure arrived 
and marianne  after taking so particular and lengthened
a leave of mrs  jennings  one so earnestly grateful  so full
of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart
from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention  and bidding
colonel brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend 
was carefully assisted by him into the carriage  of which he
seemed anxious that she should engross at least half 
mrs  dashwood and elinor then followed  and the others
were left by themselves  to talk of the travellers 
and feel their own dullness  till mrs  jennings was summoned
to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid
for the loss of her two young companions  and colonel brandon
immediately afterwards took his solitary way to delaford 

the dashwoods were two days on the road  and marianne
bore her journey on both  without essential fatigue 
every thing that the most zealous affection  the most
solicitous care could do to render her comfortable 
was the office of each watchful companion  and each
found their reward in her bodily ease  and her calmness
of spirits   to elinor  the observation of the latter
was particularly grateful   she  who had seen her week
after week so constantly suffering  oppressed by anguish
of heart which she had neither courage to speak of 
nor fortitude to conceal  now saw with a joy  which no other
could equally share  an apparent composure of mind  which 
in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection 
must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness 

as they approached barton  indeed  and entered
on scenes of which every field and every tree brought
some peculiar  some painful recollection  she grew silent
and thoughtful  and turning away her face from their notice 
sat earnestly gazing through the window   but here 
elinor could neither wonder nor blame  and when she saw 
as she assisted marianne from the carriage  that she
had been crying  she saw only an emotion too natural
in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity 
and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise   in the
whole of her subsequent manner  she traced the direction
of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion  for no sooner
had they entered their common sitting room  than marianne
turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness 
as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight
of every object with which the remembrance of willoughby could
be connected   she said little  but every sentence aimed
at cheerfulness  and though a sigh sometimes escaped her 
it never passed away without the atonement of a smile 
after dinner she would try her piano forte  she went to it 
but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera 
procured for her by willoughby  containing some of their
favourite duets  and bearing on its outward leaf her own name
in his hand writing   that would not do   she shook her head 
put the music aside  and after running over the keys
for a minute  complained of feebleness in her fingers 
and closed the instrument again  declaring however with firmness
as she did so  that she should in future practice much 

the next morning produced no abatement in these
happy symptoms   on the contrary  with a mind and body
alike strengthened by rest  she looked and spoke with
more genuine spirit  anticipating the pleasure of
margaret s return  and talking of the dear family party
which would then be restored  of their mutual pursuits
and cheerful society  as the only happiness worth a wish 

 when the weather is settled  and i have recovered
my strength   said she   we will take long walks together
every day   we will walk to the farm at the edge of the down 
and see how the children go on  we will walk to sir john s
new plantations at barton cross  and the abbeyland 
and we will often go the old ruins of the priory 
and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told
they once reached   i know we shall be happy   i know
the summer will pass happily away   i mean never to be
later in rising than six  and from that time till dinner
i shall divide every moment between music and reading 
i have formed my plan  and am determined to enter on a course
of serious study   our own library is too well known to me 
to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement 
but there are many works well worth reading at the park 
and there are others of more modern production which i
know i can borrow of colonel brandon   by reading only six
hours a day  i shall gain in the course of a twelve month
a great deal of instruction which i now feel myself to want  

elinor honoured her for a plan which originated
so nobly as this  though smiling to see the same eager
fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid
indolence and selfish repining  now at work in introducing
excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous
self control  her smile however changed to a sigh when she
remembered that promise to willoughby was yet unfulfilled 
and feared she had that to communicate which might again
unsettle the mind of marianne  and ruin at least for a time
this fair prospect of busy tranquillity   willing therefore
to delay the evil hour  she resolved to wait till her
sister s health were more secure  before she appointed it 
but the resolution was made only to be broken 

marianne had been two or three days at home  before
the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself
to venture out   but at last a soft  genial morning appeared 
such as might tempt the daughter s wishes and the
mother s confidence  and marianne  leaning on elinor s arm 
was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue 
in the lane before the house 

the sisters set out at a pace  slow as the feebleness
of marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her
illness required   and they had advanced only so far
beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill 
the important hill behind  when pausing with her eyes
turned towards it  marianne calmly said 

 there  exactly there    pointing with one hand 
 on that projecting mound   there i fell  and there
i first saw willoughby  

her voice sunk with the word  but presently reviving she added 

 i am thankful to find that i can look with so little pain
on the spot   shall we ever talk on that subject  elinor    
hesitatingly it was said    or will it be wrong   i can talk
of it now  i hope  as i ought to do    

elinor tenderly invited her to be open 

 as for regret   said marianne   i have done with that 
as far as he is concerned   i do not mean to talk to you
of what my feelings have been for him  but what they
are now   at present  if i could be satisfied on one point 
if i could be allowed to think that he was not always
acting a part  not always deceiving me   but above all 
if i could be assured that he never was so very wicked
as my fears have sometimes fancied him  since the story
of that unfortunate girl   

she stopt   elinor joyfully treasured her words
as she answered 

 if you could be assured of that  you think you
should be easy  

 yes  my peace of mind is doubly involved in it   
for not only is it horrible to suspect a person  who has
been what he has been to me  of such designs   but what must
it make me appear to myself   what in a situation like mine 
but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose
me to   

 how then   asked her sister   would you account
for his behaviour  

 i would suppose him   oh  how gladly would i suppose him 
only fickle  very  very fickle  

elinor said no more   she was debating within herself
on the eligibility of beginning her story directly 
or postponing it till marianne were in stronger health   
and they crept on for a few minutes in silence 

 i am not wishing him too much good   said marianne
at last with a sigh   when i wish his secret reflections
may be no more unpleasant than my own   he will suffer
enough in them  

 do you compare your conduct with his  

 no  i compare it with what it ought to have been 
i compare it with yours  

 our situations have borne little resemblance  

 they have borne more than our conduct   do not 
my dearest elinor  let your kindness defend what i know
your judgment must censure   my illness has made me think  
it has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection 
long before i was enough recovered to talk  i was perfectly
able to reflect   i considered the past  i saw in my
own behaviour  since the beginning of our acquaintance
with him last autumn  nothing but a series of imprudence
towards myself  and want of kindness to others 
i saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings 
and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led
me to the grave   my illness  i well knew  had been
entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my
own health  as i had felt even at the time to be wrong 
had i died   it would have been self destruction  i
did not know my danger till the danger was removed 
but with such feelings as these reflections gave me 
i wonder at my recovery   wonder that the very eagerness
of my desire to live  to have time for atonement to my god 
and to you all  did not kill me at once   had i died   
in what peculiar misery should i have left you  my nurse 
my friend  my sister   you  who had seen all the fretful
selfishness of my latter days  who had known all the
murmurings of my heart   how should i have lived in your
remembrance   my mother too  how could you have consoled
her   i cannot express my own abhorrence of myself 
whenever i looked towards the past  i saw some duty neglected 
or some failing indulged   every body seemed injured by me 
the kindness  the unceasing kindness of mrs  jennings 
i had repaid with ungrateful contempt   to the middletons 
to the palmers  the steeles  to every common acquaintance even 
i had been insolent and unjust  with a heart hardened
against their merits  and a temper irritated by their
very attention   to john  to fanny   yes  even to them 
little as they deserve  i had given less than their due 
but you   you above all  above my mother  had been wronged
by me   i  and only i  knew your heart and its sorrows 
yet to what did it influence me   not to any compassion
that could benefit you or myself   your example was
before me  but to what avail   was i more considerate
of you and your comfort   did i imitate your forbearance 
or lessen your restraints  by taking any part in those
offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude
which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone   no   
not less when i knew you to be unhappy  than when i
had believed you at ease  did i turn away from every
exertion of duty or friendship  scarcely allowing sorrow
to exist but with me  regretting only that heart
which had deserted and wronged me  and leaving you 
for or i professed an unbounded affection  to be miserable
for my sake  

here ceased the rapid flow of her self reproving spirit 
and elinor  impatient to soothe  though too honest
to flatter  gave her instantly that praise and support
which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved 
marianne pressed her hand and replied 

 you are very good   the future must be my proof 
i have laid down my plan  and if i am capable of adhering
to it  my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved 
they shall no longer worry others  nor torture myself 
i shall now live solely for my family   you  my mother 
and margaret  must henceforth be all the world to me 
you will share my affections entirely between you 
 from you  from my home  i shall never again have the smallest
incitement to move  and if i do mix in other society 
it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled 
my heart amended  and that i can practise the civilities 
the lesser duties of life  with gentleness and forbearance 
as for willoughby  to say that i shall soon or that i shall
ever forget him  would be idle   his remembrance can be overcome
by no change of circumstances or opinions   but it shall
be regulated  it shall be checked by religion  by reason 
by constant employment  

she paused  and added in a low voice   if i could
but know his heart  everything would become easy  

elinor  who had now been for some time reflecting
on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding
her narration  without feeling at all nearer decision than
at first  heard this  and perceiving that as reflection
did nothing  resolution must do all  soon found herself
leading to the fact 

she managed the recital  as she hoped  with address 
prepared her anxious listener with caution  related simply
and honestly the chief points on which willoughby
grounded his apology  did justice to his repentance 
and softened only his protestations of present regard 
marianne said not a word   she trembled  her eyes
were fixed on the ground  and her lips became whiter
than even sickness had left them   a thousand inquiries
sprung up from her heart  but she dared not urge one 
she caught every syllable with panting eagerness  her hand 
unknowingly to herself  closely pressed her sister s  and
tears covered her cheeks 

elinor  dreading her being tired  led her towards home 
and till they reached the door of the cottage 
easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be
though no question was suffered to speak it  talked of
nothing but willoughby  and their conversation together 
and was carefully minute in every particular of speech
and look  where minuteness could be safely indulged 
as soon as they entered the house  marianne with a kiss
of gratitude and these two words just articulate through
her tears   tell mama   withdrew from her sister and
walked slowly up stairs   elinor would not attempt
to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought 
and with a mind anxiously pre arranging its result 
and a resolution of reviving the subject again 
should marianne fail to do it  she turned into the parlour
to fulfill her parting injunction 



chapter 47


mrs  dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication
of her former favourite   she rejoiced in his being
cleared from some part of his imputed guilt   she was
sorry for him   she wished him happy   but the feelings
of the past could not be recalled   nothing could restore
him with a faith unbroken  a character unblemished 
to marianne   nothing could do away the knowledge
of what the latter had suffered through his means 
nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards eliza 
nothing could replace him  therefore  in her former esteem 
nor injure the interests of colonel brandon 

had mrs  dashwood  like her daughter  heard willoughby s
story from himself  had she witnessed his distress 
and been under the influence of his countenance and his
manner  it is probable that her compassion would have
been greater   but it was neither in elinor s power 
nor in her wish  to rouse such feelings in another  by her
retailed explanation  as had at first been called forth
in herself   reflection had given calmness to her judgment 
and sobered her own opinion of willoughby s deserts   
she wished  therefore  to declare only the simple truth 
and lay open such facts as were really due to his character 
without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the
fancy astray 

in the evening  when they were all three together 
marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again   
but that it was not without an effort  the restless 
unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time
previously sitting  her rising colour  as she spoke   
and her unsteady voice  plainly shewed 

 i wish to assure you both   said she   that i see
every thing  as you can desire me to do  

mrs  dashwood would have interrupted her instantly
with soothing tenderness  had not elinor  who really wished
to hear her sister s unbiased opinion  by an eager sign 
engaged her silence   marianne slowly continued  

 it is a great relief to me  what elinor told
me this morning  i have now heard exactly what i
wished to hear    for some moments her voice was lost 
but recovering herself  she added  and with greater
calmness than before   i am now perfectly satisfied 
i wish for no change   i never could have been happy
with him  after knowing  as sooner or later i must
have known  all this   i should have had no confidence 
no esteem   nothing could have done it away to my feelings  

 i know it  i know it   cried her mother 
 happy with a man of libertine practices   with one
who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends 
and the best of men   no  my marianne has not a heart
to be made happy with such a man   her conscience  her
sensitive conscience  would have felt all that the
conscience of her husband ought to have felt  

marianne sighed  and repeated   i wish for no change  

 you consider the matter   said elinor   exactly as
a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it 
and i dare say you perceive  as well as myself  not only
in this  but in many other circumstances  reason enough
to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you
in many certain troubles and disappointments  in which
you would have been poorly supported by an affection 
on his side  much less certain   had you married 
you must have been always poor   his expensiveness is
acknowledged even by himself  and his whole conduct declares
that self denial is a word hardly understood by him 
his demands and your inexperience together  on a small 
very small income  must have brought on distresses which
would not be the less grievous to you  from having been
entirely unknown and unthought of before   your sense
of honour and honesty would have led you  i know 
when aware of your situation  to attempt all the economy
that would appear to you possible  and  perhaps  as long
as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort 
you might have been suffered to practice it  but beyond that  
and how little could the utmost of your single management
do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage   
beyond that  had you endeavoured  however reasonably 
to abridge his enjoyments  is it not to be feared  that instead
of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it 
you would have lessened your own influence on his heart 
and made him regret the connection which had involved him
in such difficulties  

marianne s lips quivered  and she repeated the word
 selfish   in a tone that implied   do you really think
him selfish  

 the whole of his behaviour   replied elinor 
 from the beginning to the end of the affair  has been
grounded on selfishness   it was selfishness which first
made him sport with your affections  which afterwards 
when his own were engaged  made him delay the confession
of it  and which finally carried him from barton 
his own enjoyment  or his own ease  was  in every particular 
his ruling principle  

 it is very true   my happiness never was his object  

 at present   continued elinor   he regrets what he
has done   and why does he regret it   because he finds
it has not answered towards himself   it has not made
him happy   his circumstances are now unembarrassed  he
suffers from no evil of that kind  and he thinks only
that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper
than yourself   but does it follow that had he married you 
he would have been happy   the inconveniences would have
been different   he would then have suffered under the
pecuniary distresses which  because they are removed 
he now reckons as nothing   he would have had a wife
of whose temper he could make no complaint  but he would
have been always necessitous  always poor  and probably
would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts
of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance 
even to domestic happiness  than the mere temper of a wife  

 i have not a doubt of it   said marianne   and i
have nothing to regret  nothing but my own folly  

 rather say your mother s imprudence  my child  
said mrs  dashwood   she must be answerable  

marianne would not let her proceed   and elinor 
satisfied that each felt their own error  wished to avoid
any survey of the past that might weaken her sister s
spirits  she  therefore  pursuing the first subject 
immediately continued 

 one observation may  i think  be fairly drawn from
the whole of the story  that all willoughby s difficulties
have arisen from the first offence against virtue  in his
behaviour to eliza williams   that crime has been the origin
of every lesser one  and of all his present discontents  

marianne assented most feelingly to the remark 
and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of colonel
brandon s injuries and merits  warm as friendship
and design could unitedly dictate   her daughter did
not look  however  as if much of it were heard by her 

elinor  according to her expectation  saw on the two
or three following days  that marianne did not continue
to gain strength as she had done  but while her resolution
was unsubdued  and she still tried to appear cheerful
and easy  her sister could safely trust to the effect
of time upon her health 

margaret returned  and the family were again all
restored to each other  again quietly settled at the cottage 
and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite
so much vigour as when they first came to barton 
at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future 

elinor grew impatient for some tidings of edward 
she had heard nothing of him since her leaving london 
nothing new of his plans  nothing certain even of his
present abode   some letters had passed between her
and her brother  in consequence of marianne s illness 
and in the first of john s  there had been this sentence   
 we know nothing of our unfortunate edward  and can make no
enquiries on so prohibited a subject  but conclude him
to be still at oxford   which was all the intelligence
of edward afforded her by the correspondence  for his name
was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters 
she was not doomed  however  to be long in ignorance of
his measures 

their man servant had been sent one morning to exeter
on business  and when  as he waited at table  he had
satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event
of his errand  this was his voluntary communication  

 i suppose you know  ma am  that mr  ferrars is married  

marianne gave a violent start  fixed her eyes
upon elinor  saw her turning pale  and fell back in her
chair in hysterics   mrs  dashwood  whose eyes  as she
answered the servant s inquiry  had intuitively taken
the same direction  was shocked to perceive by elinor s
countenance how much she really suffered  and a moment
afterwards  alike distressed by marianne s situation 
knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention 

the servant  who saw only that miss marianne was
taken ill  had sense enough to call one of the maids 
who  with mrs  dashwood s assistance  supported her into
the other room   by that time  marianne was rather better 
and her mother leaving her to the care of margaret
and the maid  returned to elinor  who  though still
much disordered  had so far recovered the use of her reason
and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of thomas 
as to the source of his intelligence   mrs  dashwood
immediately took all that trouble on herself  and elinor
had the benefit of the information without the exertion
of seeking it 

 who told you that mr  ferrars was married  thomas  

 i see mr  ferrars myself  ma am  this morning
in exeter  and his lady too  miss steele as was   they was
stopping in a chaise at the door of the new london inn 
as i went there with a message from sally at the park
to her brother  who is one of the post boys  i happened
to look up as i went by the chaise  and so i see directly
it was the youngest miss steele  so i took off my hat 
and she knew me and called to me  and inquired after you 
ma am  and the young ladies  especially miss marianne 
and bid me i should give her compliments and mr  ferrars s 
their best compliments and service  and how sorry they
was they had not time to come on and see you  but they was
in a great hurry to go forwards  for they was going further
down for a little while  but howsever  when they come back 
they d make sure to come and see you  

 but did she tell you she was married  thomas  

 yes  ma am  she smiled  and said how she
had changed her name since she was in these parts 
she was always a very affable and free spoken young lady 
and very civil behaved   so  i made free to wish her joy  

 was mr  ferrars in the carriage with her  

 yes  ma am  i just see him leaning back in it 
but he did not look up   he never was a gentleman much
for talking  

elinor s heart could easily account for his not
putting himself forward  and mrs  dashwood probably
found the same explanation 

 was there no one else in the carriage  

 no  ma am  only they two  

 do you know where they came from  

 they come straight from town  as miss lucy  
mrs  ferrars told me  

 and are they going farther westward  

 yes  ma am  but not to bide long   they will soon
be back again  and then they d be sure and call here  

mrs  dashwood now looked at her daughter 
but elinor knew better than to expect them 
she recognised the whole of lucy in the message  and was
very confident that edward would never come near them 
she observed in a low voice  to her mother  that they
were probably going down to mr  pratt s  near plymouth 

thomas s intelligence seemed over   elinor looked
as if she wished to hear more 

 did you see them off  before you came away  

 no  ma am  the horses were just coming out  but i
could not bide any longer  i was afraid of being late  

 did mrs  ferrars look well  

 yes  ma am  she said how she was very well 
and to my mind she was always a very handsome young
lady  and she seemed vastly contented  

mrs  dashwood could think of no other question 
and thomas and the tablecloth  now alike needless 
were soon afterwards dismissed   marianne had already sent
to say  that she should eat nothing more   mrs  dashwood s
and elinor s appetites were equally lost  and margaret
might think herself very well off  that with so much
uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced 
so much reason as they had often had to be careless
of their meals  she had never been obliged to go without
her dinner before 

when the dessert and the wine were arranged 
and mrs  dashwood and elinor were left by themselves 
they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness
and silence   mrs  dashwood feared to hazard any remark 
and ventured not to offer consolation   she now found
that she had erred in relying on elinor s representation
of herself  and justly concluded that every thing
had been expressly softened at the time  to spare her
from an increase of unhappiness  suffering as she then
had suffered for marianne   she found that she had been
misled by the careful  the considerate attention of
her daughter  to think the attachment  which once she
had so well understood  much slighter in reality  than
she had been wont to believe  or than it was now proved
to be   she feared that under this persuasion she had
been unjust  inattentive  nay  almost unkind  to her elinor   
that marianne s affliction  because more acknowledged 
more immediately before her  had too much engrossed
her tenderness  and led her away to forget that in elinor
she might have a daughter suffering almost as much 
certainly with less self provocation  and greater fortitude 



chapter 48


elinor now found the difference between the expectation
of an unpleasant event  however certain the mind may be told
to consider it  and certainty itself   she now found  that
in spite of herself  she had always admitted a hope 
while edward remained single  that something would occur
to prevent his marrying lucy  that some resolution of
his own  some mediation of friends  or some more eligible
opportunity of establishment for the lady  would arise
to assist the happiness of all   but he was now married 
and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery 
which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence 

that he should be married soon  before  as she imagined 
he could be in orders  and consequently before he could
be in possession of the living  surprised her a little
at first   but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy 
in her self provident care  in her haste to secure him 
should overlook every thing but the risk of delay 
they were married  married in town  and now hastening
down to her uncle s   what had edward felt on being within
four miles from barton  on seeing her mother s servant 
on hearing lucy s message 

they would soon  she supposed  be settled at
delaford   delaford   that place in which so much
conspired to give her an interest  which she wished
to be acquainted with  and yet desired to avoid 
she saw them in an instant in their parsonage house  saw
in lucy  the active  contriving manager  uniting at once
a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality 
and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices   
pursuing her own interest in every thought  courting the
favour of colonel brandon  of mrs  jennings  and of every
wealthy friend   in edward  she knew not what she saw 
nor what she wished to see   happy or unhappy   nothing
pleased her  she turned away her head from every sketch of him 

elinor flattered herself that some one of their
connections in london would write to them to announce
the event  and give farther particulars   but day after
day passed off  and brought no letter  no tidings 
though uncertain that any one were to blame  she found
fault with every absent friend   they were all thoughtless
or indolent 

 when do you write to colonel brandon  ma am  
was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience
of her mind to have something going on 

 i wrote to him  my love  last week  and rather
expect to see  than to hear from him again   i earnestly
pressed his coming to us  and should not be surprised
to see him walk in today or tomorrow  or any day  

this was gaining something  something to look forward to 
colonel brandon must have some information to give 

scarcely had she so determined it  when the figure
of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window 
he stopt at their gate   it was a gentleman  it
was colonel brandon himself   now she could hear more 
and she trembled in expectation of it   but  it was
not colonel brandon  neither his air  nor his height 
were it possible  she must say it must be edward 
she looked again   he had just dismounted   she could not be
mistaken   it was edward   she moved away and sat down 
 he comes from mr  pratt s purposely to see us   i will be
calm  i will be mistress of myself  

in a moment she perceived that the others were likewise
aware of the mistake   she saw her mother and marianne
change colour  saw them look at herself  and whisper
a few sentences to each other   she would have given
the world to be able to speak  and to make them understand
that she hoped no coolness  no slight  would appear
in their behaviour to him   but she had no utterance 
and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion 

not a syllable passed aloud   they all waited
in silence for the appearance of their visitor 
his footsteps were heard along the gravel path  in a moment
he was in the passage  and in another he was before them 

his countenance  as he entered the room  was not
too happy  even for elinor   his complexion was white
with agitation  and he looked as if fearful of his
reception  and conscious that he merited no kind one 
mrs  dashwood  however  conforming  as she trusted 
to the wishes of that daughter  by whom she then meant
in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing 
met with a look of forced complacency  gave him her hand 
and wished him joy 

he coloured  and stammered out an unintelligible reply 
elinor s lips had moved with her mother s  and  when the
moment of action was over  she wished that she had shaken
hands with him too   but it was then too late  and with a
countenance meaning to be open  she sat down again
and talked of the weather 

marianne had retreated as much as possible
out of sight  to conceal her distress  and margaret 
understanding some part  but not the whole of the case 
thought it incumbent on her to be dignified  and therefore
took a seat as far from him as she could  and maintained
a strict silence 

when elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness
of the season  a very awful pause took place   it was put
an end to by mrs  dashwood  who felt obliged to hope that he
had left mrs  ferrars very well   in a hurried manner 
he replied in the affirmative 

another pause 

elinor resolving to exert herself  though fearing
the sound of her own voice  now said 

 is mrs  ferrars at longstaple  

 at longstaple   he replied  with an air of surprise   
 no  my mother is in town  

 i meant   said elinor  taking up some work from
the table   to inquire for mrs  edward ferrars  

she dared not look up   but her mother and marianne both
turned their eyes on him   he coloured  seemed perplexed 
looked doubtingly  and  after some hesitation  said   

 perhaps you mean  my brother  you mean mrs   mrs 
robert ferrars  

 mrs  robert ferrars    was repeated by marianne and her
mother in an accent of the utmost amazement   and though
elinor could not speak  even her eyes were fixed on him
with the same impatient wonder   he rose from his seat 
and walked to the window  apparently from not knowing
what to do  took up a pair of scissors that lay there 
and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting
the latter to pieces as he spoke  said  in a hurried voice 

 perhaps you do not know  you may not have heard
that my brother is lately married to  to the youngest  to
miss lucy steele  

his words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment
by all but elinor  who sat with her head leaning over
her work  in a state of such agitation as made her hardly
know where she was 

 yes   said he   they were married last week 
and are now at dawlish  

elinor could sit it no longer   she almost ran
out of the room  and as soon as the door was closed 
burst into tears of joy  which at first she thought would
never cease   edward  who had till then looked any where 
rather than at her  saw her hurry away  and perhaps saw  
or even heard  her emotion  for immediately afterwards
he fell into a reverie  which no remarks  no inquiries 
no affectionate address of mrs  dashwood could penetrate 
and at last  without saying a word  quitted the room 
and walked out towards the village  leaving the others
in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change
in his situation  so wonderful and so sudden   a perplexity
which they had no means of lessening but by their
own conjectures 



chapter 49


unaccountable  however  as the circumstances of his
release might appear to the whole family  it was certain
that edward was free  and to what purpose that freedom would
be employed was easily pre determined by all   for after
experiencing the blessings of one imprudent engagement 
contracted without his mother s consent  as he had already
done for more than four years  nothing less could be expected
of him in the failure of that  than the immediate contraction
of another 

his errand at barton  in fact  was a simple one 
it was only to ask elinor to marry him   and considering
that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question 
it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable
in the present case as he really did  so much in need of
encouragement and fresh air 

how soon he had walked himself into the proper
resolution  however  how soon an opportunity of exercising
it occurred  in what manner he expressed himself 
and how he was received  need not be particularly told 
this only need be said   that when they all sat down to
table at four o clock  about three hours after his arrival 
he had secured his lady  engaged her mother s consent 
and was not only in the rapturous profession of
the lover  but  in the reality of reason and truth 
one of the happiest of men   his situation indeed was
more than commonly joyful   he had more than the ordinary
triumph of accepted love to swell his heart  and raise
his spirits   he was released without any reproach
to himself  from an entanglement which had long formed
his misery  from a woman whom he had long ceased to love   
and elevated at once to that security with another 
which he must have thought of almost with despair 
as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire 
he was brought  not from doubt or suspense  but from
misery to happiness   and the change was openly spoken
in such a genuine  flowing  grateful cheerfulness 
as his friends had never witnessed in him before 

his heart was now open to elinor  all its weaknesses 
all its errors confessed  and his first boyish attachment
to lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty four 

 it was a foolish  idle inclination on my side  
said he   the consequence of ignorance of the world  
and want of employment   had my brother given me
some active profession when i was removed at eighteen
from the care of mr  pratt  i think  nay  i am sure 
it would never have happened  for though i left longstaple
with what i thought  at the time  a most unconquerable
preference for his niece  yet had i then had any pursuit 
any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance
from her for a few months  i should very soon have
outgrown the fancied attachment  especially by mixing
more with the world  as in such case i must have done 
but instead of having any thing to do  instead of having any
profession chosen for me  or being allowed to chuse any myself 
i returned home to be completely idle  and for the first
twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment 
which belonging to the university would have given me 
for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen 
i had therefore nothing in the world to do  but to fancy
myself in love  and as my mother did not make my home
in every respect comfortable  as i had no friend 
no companion in my brother  and disliked new acquaintance 
it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple 
where i always felt myself at home  and was always sure
of a welcome  and accordingly i spent the greatest part
of my time there from eighteen to nineteen  lucy appeared
everything that was amiable and obliging   she was pretty
too  at least i thought so then  and i had seen so little
of other women  that i could make no comparisons  and see
no defects   considering everything  therefore  i hope 
foolish as our engagement was  foolish as it has since
in every way been proved  it was not at the time an unnatural
or an inexcusable piece of folly  

the change which a few hours had wrought in the minds
and the happiness of the dashwoods  was such  so great  as
promised them all  the satisfaction of a sleepless night 
mrs  dashwood  too happy to be comfortable  knew not how
to love edward  nor praise elinor enough  how to be enough
thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy 
nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained
conversation together  and yet enjoy  as she wished 
the sight and society of both 

marianne could speak her happiness only by tears 
comparisons would occur  regrets would arise   and her joy 
though sincere as her love for her sister  was of a kind to
give her neither spirits nor language 

but elinor  how are her feelings to be described   from
the moment of learning that lucy was married to another 
that edward was free  to the moment of his justifying
the hopes which had so instantly followed  she was every
thing by turns but tranquil   but when the second moment
had passed  when she found every doubt  every solicitude
removed  compared her situation with what so lately it
had been   saw him honourably released from his former
engagement  saw him instantly profiting by the release 
to address herself and declare an affection as tender 
as constant as she had ever supposed it to be   she
was oppressed  she was overcome by her own felicity   
and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily
familiarized with any change for the better  it required
several hours to give sedateness to her spirits  or any
degree of tranquillity to her heart 

edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for
a week   for whatever other claims might be made on him 
it was impossible that less than a week should be given
up to the enjoyment of elinor s company  or suffice
to say half that was to be said of the past  the present 
and the future   for though a very few hours spent in
the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more
subjects than can really be in common between any two
rational creatures  yet with lovers it is different 
between them no subject is finished  no communication
is even made  till it has been made at least twenty
times over 

lucy s marriage  the unceasing and reasonable wonder
among them all  formed of course one of the earliest
discussions of the lovers   and elinor s particular knowledge
of each party made it appear to her in every view  as one
of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances
she had ever heard   how they could be thrown together 
and by what attraction robert could be drawn on to marry
a girl  of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak
without any admiration   a girl too already engaged
to his brother  and on whose account that brother had been
thrown off by his family  it was beyond her comprehension
to make out   to her own heart it was a delightful affair 
to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one  but
to her reason  her judgment  it was completely a puzzle 

edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing 
that  perhaps  at first accidentally meeting  the vanity
of the one had been so worked on by the flattery
of the other  as to lead by degrees to all the rest 
elinor remembered what robert had told her in harley street 
of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother s
affairs might have done  if applied to in time 
she repeated it to edward 

 that was exactly like robert    was his immediate
observation    and that   he presently added   might
perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between
them first began   and lucy perhaps at first might
think only of procuring his good offices in my favour 
other designs might afterward arise  

how long it had been carrying on between them 
however  he was equally at a loss with herself to make out 
for at oxford  where he had remained for choice ever since
his quitting london  he had had no means of hearing of her
but from herself  and her letters to the very last were
neither less frequent  nor less affectionate than usual 
not the smallest suspicion  therefore  had ever occurred
to prepare him for what followed   and when at last it
burst on him in a letter from lucy herself  he had been
for some time  he believed  half stupified between
the wonder  the horror  and the joy of such a deliverance 
he put the letter into elinor s hands 

      dear sir 

      being very sure i have long lost your affections 
     i have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own
     on another  and have no doubt of being as happy with
     him as i once used to think i might be with you 
     but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was
     another s   sincerely wish you happy in your choice 
     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always
     good friends  as our near relationship now makes
     proper   i can safely say i owe you no ill will 
     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any
     ill offices   your brother has gained my affections
     entirely  and as we could not live without one
     another  we are just returned from the altar  and
     are now on our way to dawlish for a few weeks  which
     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see 
     but thought i would first trouble you with these
     few lines  and shall always remain 

      your sincere well wisher  friend  and sister 
                                         lucy ferrars 

      i have burnt all your letters  and will return
     your picture the first opportunity   please to destroy
     my scrawls  but the ring with my hair you are very
     welcome to keep  

elinor read and returned it without any comment 

 i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition  
said edward    for worlds would not i have had a letter
of hers seen by you in former days   in a sister it
is bad enough  but in a wife   how i have blushed over
the pages of her writing   and i believe i may say that
since the first half year of our foolish  business  this
is the only letter i ever received from her  of which
the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style  

 however it may have come about   said elinor 
after a pause    they are certainly married   and your mother
has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment 
the independence she settled on robert  through resentment
against you  has put it in his power to make his own choice 
and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand
a year  to do the very deed which she disinherited the
other for intending to do   she will hardly be less hurt 
i suppose  by robert s marrying lucy  than she would have
been by your marrying her  

 she will be more hurt by it  for robert always
was her favourite   she will be more hurt by it 
and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner  

in what state the affair stood at present between them 
edward knew not  for no communication with any of his family
had yet been attempted by him   he had quitted oxford
within four and twenty hours after lucy s letter arrived 
and with only one object before him  the nearest road
to barton  had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct 
with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection 
he could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with
miss dashwood  and by his rapidity in seeking that fate 
it is to be supposed  in spite of the jealousy with
which he had once thought of colonel brandon  in spite
of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts 
and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts 
he did not  upon the whole  expect a very cruel reception 
it was his business  however  to say that he did  and he
said it very prettily   what he might say on the subject
a twelvemonth after  must be referred to the imagination
of husbands and wives 

that lucy had certainly meant to deceive  to go off
with a flourish of malice against him in her message
by thomas  was perfectly clear to elinor  and edward himself 
now thoroughly enlightened on her character  had no
scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness
of wanton ill nature  though his eyes had been long opened 
even before his acquaintance with elinor began  to her
ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions  
they had been equally imputed  by him  to her want
of education  and till her last letter reached him 
he had always believed her to be a well disposed 
good hearted girl  and thoroughly attached to himself 
nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented
his putting an end to an engagement  which  long before
the discovery of it laid him open to his mother s anger 
had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him 

 i thought it my duty   said he   independent of my feelings 
to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not 
when i was renounced by my mother  and stood to all
appearance without a friend in the world to assist me 
in such a situation as that  where there seemed nothing
to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature 
how could i suppose  when she so earnestly  so warmly insisted
on sharing my fate  whatever it might be  that any thing
but the most disinterested affection was her inducement 
and even now  i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted 
or what fancied advantage it could be to her  to be
fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard 
and who had only two thousand pounds in the world 
she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a
living  

 no  but she might suppose that something would occur
in your favour  that your own family might in time relent 
and at any rate  she lost nothing by continuing the engagement 
for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination
nor her actions   the connection was certainly a
respectable one  and probably gained her consideration among
her friends  and  if nothing more advantageous occurred 
it would be better for her to marry you than be single  

edward was  of course  immediately convinced that
nothing could have been more natural than lucy s conduct 
nor more self evident than the motive of it 

elinor scolded him  harshly as ladies always scold
the imprudence which compliments themselves  for having
spent so much time with them at norland  when he must
have felt his own inconstancy 

 your behaviour was certainly very wrong   said she 
 because  to say nothing of my own conviction  our relations
were all led away by it to fancy and expect what  as you
were then situated  could never be  

he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart 
and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement 

 i was simple enough to think  that because my faith
was plighted to another  there could be no danger in my being
with you  and that the consciousness of my engagement was
to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour   i felt
that i admired you  but i told myself it was only friendship 
and till i began to make comparisons between yourself
and lucy  i did not know how far i was got   after that 
i suppose  i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex 
and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the
expediency of it  were no better than these   the danger
is my own  i am doing no injury to anybody but myself  

elinor smiled  and shook her head 

edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon s
being expected at the cottage  as he really wished
not only to be better acquainted with him  but to have an
opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented
his giving him the living of delaford   which  at present  
said he   after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine
were on the occasion  he must think i have never forgiven
him for offering  

now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet
been to the place   but so little interest had be taken
in the matter  that he owed all his knowledge of the house 
garden  and glebe  extent of the parish  condition of
the land  and rate of the tithes  to elinor herself 
who had heard so much of it from colonel brandon 
and heard it with so much attention  as to be entirely
mistress of the subject 

one question after this only remained undecided 
between them  one difficulty only was to be overcome 
they were brought together by mutual affection 
with the warmest approbation of their real friends 
their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make
their happiness certain  and they only wanted something
to live upon   edward had two thousand pounds  and elinor
one  which  with delaford living  was all that they could
call their own  for it was impossible that mrs  dashwood
should advance anything  and they were neither of them
quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty
pounds a year would supply them with the comforts of life 

edward was not entirely without hopes of some
favourable change in his mother towards him  and on that
he rested for the residue of their income   but elinor
had no such dependence  for since edward would still
be unable to marry miss morton  and his chusing herself
had been spoken of in mrs  ferrars s flattering language
as only a lesser evil than his chusing lucy steele 
she feared that robert s offence would serve no other
purpose than to enrich fanny 

about four days after edward s arrival colonel
brandon appeared  to complete mrs  dashwood s satisfaction 
and to give her the dignity of having  for the first time
since her living at barton  more company with her than
her house would hold   edward was allowed to retain the
privilege of first comer  and colonel brandon therefore
walked every night to his old quarters at the park 
from whence he usually returned in the morning  early enough
to interrupt the lovers  first tete a tete before breakfast 

a three weeks  residence at delaford  where 
in his evening hours at least  he had little to do
but to calculate the disproportion between thirty six
and seventeen  brought him to barton in a temper of mind
which needed all the improvement in marianne s looks 
all the kindness of her welcome  and all the encouragement
of her mother s language  to make it cheerful 
among such friends  however  and such flattery  he did revive 
no rumour of lucy s marriage had yet reached him   he knew
nothing of what had passed  and the first hours of his
visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering 
every thing was explained to him by mrs  dashwood 
and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done
for mr  ferrars  since eventually it promoted the interest
of elinor 

it would be needless to say  that the gentlemen advanced
in the good opinion of each other  as they advanced in each
other s acquaintance  for it could not be otherwise 
their resemblance in good principles and good sense 
in disposition and manner of thinking  would probably
have been sufficient to unite them in friendship 
without any other attraction  but their being in love
with two sisters  and two sisters fond of each other 
made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate 
which might otherwise have waited the effect of time
and judgment 

the letters from town  which a few days before would
have made every nerve in elinor s body thrill with transport 
now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth 
mrs  jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale  to vent her
honest indignation against the jilting girl  and pour forth
her compassion towards poor mr  edward  who  she was sure 
had quite doted upon the worthless hussy  and was now 
by all accounts  almost broken hearted  at oxford   
 i do think   she continued   nothing was ever carried
on so sly  for it was but two days before lucy called
and sat a couple of hours with me   not a soul suspected
anything of the matter  not even nancy  who  poor soul 
came crying to me the day after  in a great fright
for fear of mrs  ferrars  as well as not knowing how to
get to plymouth  for lucy it seems borrowed all her
money before she went off to be married  on purpose
we suppose to make a show with  and poor nancy had not
seven shillings in the world   so i was very glad to give
her five guineas to take her down to exeter  where she
thinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs  burgess 
in hopes  as i tell her  to fall in with the doctor again 
and i must say that lucy s crossness not to take them
along with them in the chaise is worse than all 
poor mr  edward  i cannot get him out of my head  but you
must send for him to barton  and miss marianne must try to
comfort him  

mr  dashwood s strains were more solemn 
mrs  ferrars was the most unfortunate of women  poor
fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility  and he
considered the existence of each  under such a blow 
with grateful wonder   robert s offence was unpardonable 
but lucy s was infinitely worse   neither of them were
ever again to be mentioned to mrs  ferrars  and even 
if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son 
his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter 
nor be permitted to appear in her presence   the secrecy
with which everything had been carried on between them 
was rationally treated as enormously heightening
the crime  because  had any suspicion of it occurred
to the others  proper measures would have been taken
to prevent the marriage  and he called on elinor to join
with him in regretting that lucy s engagement with edward
had not rather been fulfilled  than that she should thus
be the means of spreading misery farther in the family   
he thus continued 

 mrs  ferrars has never yet mentioned edward s name 
which does not surprise us  but  to our great astonishment 
not a line has been received from him on the occasion 
perhaps  however  he is kept silent by his fear of offending 
and i shall  therefore  give him a hint  by a line
to oxford  that his sister and i both think a letter
of proper submission from him  addressed perhaps to fanny 
and by her shewn to her mother  might not be taken amiss 
for we all know the tenderness of mrs  ferrars s heart 
and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms
with her children  

this paragraph was of some importance to the
prospects and conduct of edward   it determined him
to attempt a reconciliation  though not exactly
in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister 

 a letter of proper submission   repeated he 
 would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s
ingratitude to her  and breach of honour to me   i can
make no submission  i am grown neither humble nor
penitent by what has passed   i am grown very happy 
but that would not interest   i know of no submission
that is proper for me to make  

 you may certainly ask to be forgiven   said elinor 
 because you have offended   and i should think you
might now venture so far as to profess some concern
for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you
your mother s anger  

he agreed that he might 

 and when she has forgiven you  perhaps a little humility
may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement 
almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first  

he had nothing to urge against it  but still
resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission 
and therefore  to make it easier to him  as he declared
a much greater willingness to make mean concessions
by word of mouth than on paper  it was resolved that 
instead of writing to fanny  he should go to london 
and personally intreat her good offices in his favour   
 and if they really do interest themselves   said marianne 
in her new character of candour   in bringing about
a reconciliation  i shall think that even john and fanny
are not entirely without merit  

after a visit on colonel brandon s side of only three
or four days  the two gentlemen quitted barton together   
they were to go immediately to delaford  that edward
might have some personal knowledge of his future home 
and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what
improvements were needed to it  and from thence 
after staying there a couple of nights  he was to proceed
on his journey to town 



chapter 50


after a proper resistance on the part of mrs  ferrars 
just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that
reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring 
the reproach of being too amiable  edward was admitted
to her presence  and pronounced to be again her son 

her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating 
for many years of her life she had had two sons 
but the crime and annihilation of edward a few weeks ago 
had robbed her of one  the similar annihilation of robert
had left her for a fortnight without any  and now 
by the resuscitation of edward  she had one again 

in spite of his being allowed once more to live 
however  he did not feel the continuance of his existence
secure  till he had revealed his present engagement 
for the publication of that circumstance  he feared 
might give a sudden turn to his constitution  and carry
him off as rapidly as before   with apprehensive caution
therefore it was revealed  and he was listened to with
unexpected calmness   mrs  ferrars at first reasonably
endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying miss dashwood 
by every argument in her power   told him  that in miss morton
he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune   
and enforced the assertion  by observing that miss morton
was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds 
while miss dashwood was only the daughter of a private
gentleman with no more than three  but when she found that 
though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation 
he was by no means inclined to be guided by it 
she judged it wisest  from the experience of the past 
to submit  and therefore  after such an ungracious delay
as she owed to her own dignity  and as served to prevent
every suspicion of good will  she issued her decree
of consent to the marriage of edward and elinor 

what she would engage to do towards augmenting
their income was next to be considered  and here it
plainly appeared  that though edward was now her only son 
he was by no means her eldest  for while robert was
inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a year 
not the smallest objection was made against edward s taking
orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost 
nor was anything promised either for the present or in future 
beyond the ten thousand pounds  which had been given with fanny 

it was as much  however  as was desired 
and more than was expected  by edward and elinor 
and mrs  ferrars herself  by her shuffling excuses 
seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more 

with an income quite sufficient to their wants
thus secured to them  they had nothing to wait for
after edward was in possession of the living  but the
readiness of the house  to which colonel brandon 
with an eager desire for the accommodation of elinor 
was making considerable improvements  and after waiting
some time for their completion  after experiencing 
as usual  a thousand disappointments and delays
from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen  elinor 
as usual  broke through the first positive resolution
of not marrying till every thing was ready  and the
ceremony took place in barton church early in the autumn 

the first month after their marriage was spent
with their friend at the mansion house  from whence
they could superintend the progress of the parsonage 
and direct every thing as they liked on the spot   
could chuse papers  project shrubberies  and invent a sweep 
mrs  jennings s prophecies  though rather jumbled together 
were chiefly fulfilled  for she was able to visit edward
and his wife in their parsonage by michaelmas  and she
found in elinor and her husband  as she really believed 
one of the happiest couples in the world   they had
in fact nothing to wish for  but the marriage of colonel
brandon and marianne  and rather better pasturage for
their cows 

they were visited on their first settling by almost
all their relations and friends   mrs  ferrars came
to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed
of having authorised  and even the dashwoods were at
the expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour 

 i will not say that i am disappointed  my dear sister  
said john  as they were walking together one morning before
the gates of delaford house   that would be saying too much 
for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young
women in the world  as it is   but  i confess  it would
give me great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother 
his property here  his place  his house  every thing is in
such respectable and excellent condition   and his woods   i
have not seen such timber any where in dorsetshire  as there
is now standing in delaford hanger   and though  perhaps 
marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him  
yet i think it would altogether be advisable for you to
have them now frequently staying with you  for as colonel
brandon seems a great deal at home  nobody can tell what
may happen  for  when people are much thrown together 
and see little of anybody else  and it will always be
in your power to set her off to advantage  and so forth   
in short  you may as well give her a chance  you understand
me    

but though mrs  ferrars did come to see them  and always
treated them with the make believe of decent affection 
they were never insulted by her real favour and preference 
that was due to the folly of robert  and the cunning
of his wife  and it was earned by them before many months
had passed away   the selfish sagacity of the latter 
which had at first drawn robert into the scrape 
was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it 
for her respectful humility  assiduous attentions 
and endless flatteries  as soon as the smallest opening
was given for their exercise  reconciled mrs  ferrars
to his choice  and re established him completely in
her favour 

the whole of lucy s behaviour in the affair 
and the prosperity which crowned it  therefore  may be held
forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest 
an unceasing attention to self interest  however its progress
may be apparently obstructed  will do in securing every
advantage of fortune  with no other sacrifice than that of time
and conscience   when robert first sought her acquaintance 
and privately visited her in bartlett s buildings 
it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother 
he merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement 
and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection
of both  he naturally expected that one or two interviews
would settle the matter   in that point  however 
and that only  he erred   for though lucy soon gave him
hopes that his eloquence would convince her in time 
another visit  another conversation  was always wanted
to produce this conviction   some doubts always lingered
in her mind when they parted  which could only be
removed by another half hour s discourse with himself 
his attendance was by this means secured  and the rest
followed in course   instead of talking of edward 
they came gradually to talk only of robert   a subject
on which he had always more to say than on any other 
and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal
to his own  and in short  it became speedily evident
to both  that he had entirely supplanted his brother 
he was proud of his conquest  proud of tricking edward 
and very proud of marrying privately without his
mother s consent   what immediately followed is known 
they passed some months in great happiness at dawlish 
for she had many relations and old acquaintances to
cut  and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages   
and from thence returning to town  procured the forgiveness
of mrs  ferrars  by the simple expedient of asking it 
which  at lucy s instigation  was adopted   the forgiveness 
at first  indeed  as was reasonable  comprehended only robert 
and lucy  who had owed his mother no duty and therefore
could have transgressed none  still remained some weeks
longer unpardoned   but perseverance in humility of conduct
and messages  in self condemnation for robert s offence 
and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with 
procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame
her by its graciousness  and led soon afterwards  by rapid
degrees  to the highest state of affection and influence 
lucy became as necessary to mrs  ferrars  as either robert
or fanny  and while edward was never cordially forgiven
for having once intended to marry her  and elinor 
though superior to her in fortune and birth  was spoken
of as an intruder  she was in every thing considered 
and always openly acknowledged  to be a favourite child 
they settled in town  received very liberal assistance
from mrs  ferrars  were on the best terms imaginable
with the dashwoods  and setting aside the jealousies
and ill will continually subsisting between fanny and lucy 
in which their husbands of course took a part  as well
as the frequent domestic disagreements between robert and
lucy themselves  nothing could exceed the harmony in which
they all lived together 

what edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest
son  might have puzzled many people to find out  and what
robert had done to succeed to it  might have puzzled them
still more   it was an arrangement  however  justified in
its effects  if not in its cause  for nothing ever
appeared in robert s style of living or of talking to give
a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income 
as either leaving his brother too little  or bringing
himself too much   and if edward might be judged from
the ready discharge of his duties in every particular 
from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home 
and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits 
he might be supposed no less contented with his lot 
no less free from every wish of an exchange 

elinor s marriage divided her as little from her
family as could well be contrived  without rendering
the cottage at barton entirely useless  for her mother
and sisters spent much more than half their time with her 
mrs  dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well
as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at delaford 
for her wish of bringing marianne and colonel brandon together
was hardly less earnest  though rather more liberal than
what john had expressed   it was now her darling object 
precious as was the company of her daughter to her 
she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant
enjoyment to her valued friend  and to see marianne settled at
the mansion house was equally the wish of edward and elinor 
they each felt his sorrows  and their own obligations 
and marianne  by general consent  was to be the reward
of all 

with such a confederacy against her  with a knowledge
so intimate of his goodness  with a conviction of his fond
attachment to herself  which at last  though long after it
was observable to everybody else  burst on her  what could she
do 

marianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate 
she was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions 
and to counteract  by her conduct  her most favourite maxims 
she was born to overcome an affection formed so late
in life as at seventeen  and with no sentiment
superior to strong esteem and lively friendship 
voluntarily to give her hand to another   and that other 
a man who had suffered no less than herself under the
event of a former attachment  whom  two years before 
she had considered too old to be married   and who still
sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat 

but so it was   instead of falling a sacrifice
to an irresistible passion  as once she had fondly
flattered herself with expecting   instead of remaining
even for ever with her mother  and finding her only
pleasures in retirement and study  as afterwards in her
more calm and sober judgment she had determined on   
she found herself at nineteen  submitting to new attachments 
entering on new duties  placed in a new home  a wife 
the mistress of a family  and the patroness of a village 

colonel brandon was now as happy  as all those who best
loved him  believed he deserved to be   in marianne he
was consoled for every past affliction   her regard and her
society restored his mind to animation  and his spirits
to cheerfulness  and that marianne found her own happiness
in forming his  was equally the persuasion and delight
of each observing friend   marianne could never love
by halves  and her whole heart became  in time  as much
devoted to her husband  as it had once been to willoughby 

willoughby could not hear of her marriage without
a pang  and his punishment was soon afterwards complete
in the voluntary forgiveness of mrs  smith  who  by stating
his marriage with a woman of character  as the source
of her clemency  gave him reason for believing that had he
behaved with honour towards marianne  he might at once have
been happy and rich   that his repentance of misconduct 
which thus brought its own punishment  was sincere 
need not be doubted   nor that he long thought of colonel
brandon with envy  and of marianne with regret   but that
he was for ever inconsolable  that he fled from society 
or contracted an habitual gloom of temper  or died of a
broken heart  must not be depended on  for he did neither 
he lived to exert  and frequently to enjoy himself 
his wife was not always out of humour  nor his home
always uncomfortable  and in his breed of horses and dogs 
and in sporting of every kind  he found no inconsiderable
degree of domestic felicity 

for marianne  however  in spite of his incivility
in surviving her loss  he always retained that decided
regard which interested him in every thing that befell her 
and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman   
and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in
after days as bearing no comparison with mrs  brandon 

mrs  dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage 
without attempting a removal to delaford  and fortunately for
sir john and mrs  jennings  when marianne was taken from them 
margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing 
and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover 

between barton and delaford  there was that constant
communication which strong family affection would
naturally dictate   and among the merits and the happiness
of elinor and marianne  let it not be ranked as the least
considerable  that though sisters  and living almost within
sight of each other  they could live without disagreement
between themselves  or producing coolness between their husbands 

the end
