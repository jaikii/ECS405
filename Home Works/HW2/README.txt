1. Run the program on python 2.7 version
2. Make sure 'matplotlib' is installed in the system, if program is showing error then cooment out the plot part since plots are there in the .tar file.

What I have done:
> I changed the text in lowercase and saved in file named 'lower-austen-courpus.txt'.
> I removed the punctuators (!@#$%^&*()_+}{|":?><-=\][;'/.,`) from the file 'lower-austen-courpus.txt' and saved to another file 'textwithoutpunctuators.txt'.
> I read the the file 'textwithoutpunctuators.txt' and stored the frequency of words and letters.
> I ranked it as asked
> I plotted the graphs as asked and saved it (attached in .tar file).
