VOLUME I

CHAPTER I


EMMA WOODHOUSE, HANDSOME, CLEVER, AND RICH, WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME
AND HAPPY DISPOSITION, SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS
OF EXISTENCE; AND HAD LIVED NEARLY TWENTY-ONE YEARS IN THE WORLD
WITH VERY LITTLE TO DISTRESS OR VEX HER.

SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF A MOST AFFECTIONATE,
INDULGENT FATHER; AND HAD, IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SISTER'S MARRIAGE,
BEEN MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD.  HER MOTHER
HAD DIED TOO LONG AGO FOR HER TO HAVE MORE THAN AN INDISTINCT
REMEMBRANCE OF HER CARESSES; AND HER PLACE HAD BEEN SUPPLIED
BY AN EXCELLENT WOMAN AS GOVERNESS, WHO HAD FALLEN LITTLE SHORT
OF A MOTHER IN AFFECTION.

SIXTEEN YEARS HAD MISS TAYLOR BEEN IN MR. WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY,
LESS AS A GOVERNESS THAN A FRIEND, VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS,
BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA.  BETWEEN _THEM_ IT WAS MORE THE INTIMACY
OF SISTERS.  EVEN BEFORE MISS TAYLOR HAD CEASED TO HOLD THE NOMINAL
OFFICE OF GOVERNESS, THE MILDNESS OF HER TEMPER HAD HARDLY ALLOWED
HER TO IMPOSE ANY RESTRAINT; AND THE SHADOW OF AUTHORITY BEING
NOW LONG PASSED AWAY, THEY HAD BEEN LIVING TOGETHER AS FRIEND AND
FRIEND VERY MUTUALLY ATTACHED, AND EMMA DOING JUST WHAT SHE LIKED;
HIGHLY ESTEEMING MISS TAYLOR'S JUDGMENT, BUT DIRECTED CHIEFLY BY
HER OWN.

THE REAL EVILS, INDEED, OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING
RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY, AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE
TOO WELL OF HERSELF; THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED
ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS.  THE DANGER, HOWEVER, WAS AT PRESENT
SO UNPERCEIVED, THAT THEY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RANK AS MISFORTUNES
WITH HER.

SORROW CAME--A GENTLE SORROW--BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY
DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS.--MISS TAYLOR MARRIED.  IT WAS MISS
TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF.  IT WAS ON THE WEDDING-DAY
OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT
OF ANY CONTINUANCE.  THE WEDDING OVER, AND THE BRIDE-PEOPLE GONE,
HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER, WITH NO PROSPECT
OF A THIRD TO CHEER A LONG EVENING.  HER FATHER COMPOSED HIMSELF
TO SLEEP AFTER DINNER, AS USUAL, AND SHE HAD THEN ONLY TO SIT
AND THINK OF WHAT SHE HAD LOST.

THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND.  MR. WESTON
WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER, EASY FORTUNE, SUITABLE AGE,
AND PLEASANT MANNERS; AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING
WITH WHAT SELF-DENYING, GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED
AND PROMOTED THE MATCH; BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER.
THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY.
SHE RECALLED HER PAST KINDNESS--THE KINDNESS, THE AFFECTION OF SIXTEEN
YEARS--HOW SHE HAD TAUGHT AND HOW SHE HAD PLAYED WITH HER FROM FIVE
YEARS OLD--HOW SHE HAD DEVOTED ALL HER POWERS TO ATTACH AND AMUSE
HER IN HEALTH--AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES
OF CHILDHOOD.  A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE; BUT THE
INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT
UNRESERVE WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE, ON THEIR
BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER, WAS YET A DEARER, TENDERER RECOLLECTION.
SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED: INTELLIGENT,
WELL-INFORMED, USEFUL, GENTLE, KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY,
INTERESTED IN ALL ITS CONCERNS, AND PECULIARLY INTERESTED IN HERSELF,
IN EVERY PLEASURE, EVERY SCHEME OF HERS--ONE TO WHOM SHE COULD SPEAK
EVERY THOUGHT AS IT AROSE, AND WHO HAD SUCH AN AFFECTION FOR HER
AS COULD NEVER FIND FAULT.

HOW WAS SHE TO BEAR THE CHANGE?--IT WAS TRUE THAT HER FRIEND WAS
GOING ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM; BUT EMMA WAS AWARE THAT GREAT MUST
BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MRS. WESTON, ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM,
AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE; AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES,
NATURAL AND DOMESTIC, SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING
FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE.  SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER, BUT HE
WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER.  HE COULD NOT MEET HER IN CONVERSATION,
RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL.

THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES (AND MR. WOODHOUSE HAD
NOT MARRIED EARLY) WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS;
FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE, WITHOUT ACTIVITY
OF MIND OR BODY, HE WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN IN WAYS THAN IN YEARS;
AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART
AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER, HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM
AT ANY TIME.

HER SISTER, THOUGH COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE REMOVED BY MATRIMONY,
BEING SETTLED IN LONDON, ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF, WAS MUCH BEYOND
HER DAILY REACH; AND MANY A LONG OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER EVENING MUST
BE STRUGGLED THROUGH AT HARTFIELD, BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT
VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND, AND THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN,
TO FILL THE HOUSE, AND GIVE HER PLEASANT SOCIETY AGAIN.

HIGHBURY, THE LARGE AND POPULOUS VILLAGE, ALMOST AMOUNTING TO A TOWN,
TO WHICH HARTFIELD, IN SPITE OF ITS SEPARATE LAWN, AND SHRUBBERIES,
AND NAME, DID REALLY BELONG, AFFORDED HER NO EQUALS.  THE WOODHOUSES
WERE FIRST IN CONSEQUENCE THERE.  ALL LOOKED UP TO THEM.  SHE HAD
MANY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PLACE, FOR HER FATHER WAS UNIVERSALLY CIVIL,
BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS
TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY.  IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE; AND EMMA
COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT, AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS,
TILL HER FATHER AWOKE, AND MADE IT NECESSARY TO BE CHEERFUL.
HIS SPIRITS REQUIRED SUPPORT.  HE WAS A NERVOUS MAN, EASILY DEPRESSED;
FOND OF EVERY BODY THAT HE WAS USED TO, AND HATING TO PART WITH THEM;
HATING CHANGE OF EVERY KIND.  MATRIMONY, AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE,
WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE; AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED
TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING, NOR COULD EVER SPEAK OF HER BUT
WITH COMPASSION, THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION,
WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO; AND FROM
HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS, AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO
SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF,
HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE AS SAD
A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM, AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL
HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD.
EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD, TO KEEP HIM
FROM SUCH THOUGHTS; BUT WHEN TEA CAME, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM
NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER,

"POOR MISS TAYLOR!--I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN.  WHAT A PITY IT
IS THAT MR. WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER!"

"I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU, PAPA; YOU KNOW I CANNOT.  MR. WESTON IS SUCH
A GOOD-HUMOURED, PLEASANT, EXCELLENT MAN, THAT HE THOROUGHLY DESERVES
A GOOD WIFE;--AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MISS TAYLOR LIVE WITH US
FOR EVER, AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS, WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN?"

"A HOUSE OF HER OWN!--BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN?
THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE.--AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS,
MY DEAR."

"HOW OFTEN WE SHALL BE GOING TO SEE THEM, AND THEY COMING TO SEE
US!--WE SHALL BE ALWAYS MEETING! _WE_ MUST BEGIN; WE MUST GO AND PAY
WEDDING VISIT VERY SOON."

"MY DEAR, HOW AM I TO GET SO FAR? RANDALLS IS SUCH A DISTANCE.
I COULD NOT WALK HALF SO FAR."

"NO, PAPA, NOBODY THOUGHT OF YOUR WALKING.  WE MUST GO IN THE CARRIAGE,
TO BE SURE."

"THE CARRIAGE! BUT JAMES WILL NOT LIKE TO PUT THE HORSES TO FOR
SUCH A LITTLE WAY;--AND WHERE ARE THE POOR HORSES TO BE WHILE WE
ARE PAYING OUR VISIT?"

"THEY ARE TO BE PUT INTO MR. WESTON'S STABLE, PAPA.  YOU KNOW WE
HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY.  WE TALKED IT ALL OVER WITH MR. WESTON
LAST NIGHT.  AND AS FOR JAMES, YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WILL ALWAYS LIKE
GOING TO RANDALLS, BECAUSE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BEING HOUSEMAID THERE.
I ONLY DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER TAKE US ANYWHERE ELSE.  THAT WAS
YOUR DOING, PAPA.  YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE.  NOBODY THOUGHT
OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER--JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU!"

"I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER.  IT WAS VERY LUCKY, FOR I WOULD
NOT HAVE HAD POOR JAMES THINK HIMSELF SLIGHTED UPON ANY ACCOUNT;
AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD SERVANT: SHE IS A CIVIL,
PRETTY-SPOKEN GIRL; I HAVE A GREAT OPINION OF HER.  WHENEVER I SEE HER,
SHE ALWAYS CURTSEYS AND ASKS ME HOW I DO, IN A VERY PRETTY MANNER;
AND WHEN YOU HAVE HAD HER HERE TO DO NEEDLEWORK, I OBSERVE SHE
ALWAYS TURNS THE LOCK OF THE DOOR THE RIGHT WAY AND NEVER BANGS IT.
I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT; AND IT WILL BE A GREAT
COMFORT TO POOR MISS TAYLOR TO HAVE SOMEBODY ABOUT HER THAT SHE IS
USED TO SEE.  WHENEVER JAMES GOES OVER TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW,
SHE WILL BE HEARING OF US.  HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE
ALL ARE."

EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS,
AND HOPED, BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON, TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY
THROUGH THE EVENING, AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN.
THE BACKGAMMON-TABLE WAS PLACED; BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY.

MR. KNIGHTLEY, A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT-AND-THIRTY, WAS NOT
ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY, BUT PARTICULARLY
CONNECTED WITH IT, AS THE ELDER BROTHER OF ISABELLA'S HUSBAND.
HE LIVED ABOUT A MILE FROM HIGHBURY, WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR,
AND ALWAYS WELCOME, AND AT THIS TIME MORE WELCOME THAN USUAL,
AS COMING DIRECTLY FROM THEIR MUTUAL CONNEXIONS IN LONDON.  HE HAD
RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER, AFTER SOME DAYS' ABSENCE, AND NOW WALKED
UP TO HARTFIELD TO SAY THAT ALL WERE WELL IN BRUNSWICK SQUARE.
IT WAS A HAPPY CIRCUMSTANCE, AND ANIMATED MR. WOODHOUSE FOR SOME TIME.
MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER, WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD;
AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER "POOR ISABELLA" AND HER CHILDREN WERE
ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY.  WHEN THIS WAS OVER, MR. WOODHOUSE
GRATEFULLY OBSERVED, "IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU, MR. KNIGHTLEY, TO COME
OUT AT THIS LATE HOUR TO CALL UPON US.  I AM AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE
HAD A SHOCKING WALK."

"NOT AT ALL, SIR.  IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT NIGHT; AND SO MILD
THAT I MUST DRAW BACK FROM YOUR GREAT FIRE."

"BUT YOU MUST HAVE FOUND IT VERY DAMP AND DIRTY.  I WISH YOU MAY
NOT CATCH COLD."

"DIRTY, SIR! LOOK AT MY SHOES.  NOT A SPECK ON THEM."

"WELL! THAT IS QUITE SURPRISING, FOR WE HAVE HAD A VAST DEAL
OF RAIN HERE.  IT RAINED DREADFULLY HARD FOR HALF AN HOUR
WHILE WE WERE AT BREAKFAST.  I WANTED THEM TO PUT OFF THE WEDDING."

"BY THE BYE--I HAVE NOT WISHED YOU JOY.  BEING PRETTY WELL AWARE
OF WHAT SORT OF JOY YOU MUST BOTH BE FEELING, I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY
WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS; BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL.
HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE? WHO CRIED MOST?"

"AH! POOR MISS TAYLOR! 'TIS A SAD BUSINESS."

"POOR MR. AND MISS WOODHOUSE, IF YOU PLEASE; BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY
SAY `POOR MISS TAYLOR.' I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA;
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE!--AT
ANY RATE, IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO."

"ESPECIALLY WHEN _ONE_ OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL, TROUBLESOME CREATURE!"
SAID EMMA PLAYFULLY.  "THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD,
I KNOW--AND WHAT YOU WOULD CERTAINLY SAY IF MY FATHER WERE NOT BY."

"I BELIEVE IT IS VERY TRUE, MY DEAR, INDEED," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE,
WITH A SIGH.  "I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME."

"MY DEAREST PAPA! YOU DO NOT THINK I COULD MEAN _YOU_, OR SUPPOSE
MR. KNIGHTLEY TO MEAN _YOU_.  WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA! OH NO! I MEANT
ONLY MYSELF.  MR. KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME, YOU KNOW--
IN A JOKE--IT IS ALL A JOKE.  WE ALWAYS SAY WHAT WE LIKE TO ONE ANOTHER."

MR. KNIGHTLEY, IN FACT, WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO COULD SEE
FAULTS IN EMMA WOODHOUSE, AND THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER TOLD HER OF THEM:
AND THOUGH THIS WAS NOT PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE TO EMMA HERSELF,
SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS SO TO HER FATHER, THAT SHE WOULD
NOT HAVE HIM REALLY SUSPECT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE AS HER NOT BEING
THOUGHT PERFECT BY EVERY BODY.

"EMMA KNOWS I NEVER FLATTER HER," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, "BUT I
MEANT NO REFLECTION ON ANY BODY.  MISS TAYLOR HAS BEEN USED
TO HAVE TWO PERSONS TO PLEASE; SHE WILL NOW HAVE BUT ONE.
THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE MUST BE A GAINER."

"WELL," SAID EMMA, WILLING TO LET IT PASS--"YOU WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THE WEDDING; AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU, FOR WE ALL
BEHAVED CHARMINGLY.  EVERY BODY WAS PUNCTUAL, EVERY BODY IN THEIR
BEST LOOKS: NOT A TEAR, AND HARDLY A LONG FACE TO BE SEEN.  OH NO;
WE ALL FELT THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ONLY HALF A MILE APART,
AND WERE SURE OF MEETING EVERY DAY."

"DEAR EMMA BEARS EVERY THING SO WELL," SAID HER FATHER.
"BUT, MR. KNIGHTLEY, SHE IS REALLY VERY SORRY TO LOSE POOR MISS TAYLOR,
AND I AM SURE SHE _WILL_ MISS HER MORE THAN SHE THINKS FOR."

EMMA TURNED AWAY HER HEAD, DIVIDED BETWEEN TEARS AND SMILES.
"IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION,"
SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY.  "WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO, SIR,
IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT; BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO
MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE; SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE,
AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE, TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN,
AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION,
AND THEREFORE CANNOT ALLOW HERSELF TO FEEL SO MUCH PAIN AS PLEASURE.
EVERY FRIEND OF MISS TAYLOR MUST BE GLAD TO HAVE HER SO HAPPILY
MARRIED."

"AND YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ONE MATTER OF JOY TO ME," SAID EMMA,
"AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE--THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF.
I MADE THE MATCH, YOU KNOW, FOUR YEARS AGO; AND TO HAVE IT TAKE PLACE,
AND BE PROVED IN THE RIGHT, WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAID MR. WESTON WOULD
NEVER MARRY AGAIN, MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING."

MR. KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER.  HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED,
"AH! MY DEAR, I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS,
FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS.  PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY
MORE MATCHES."

"I PROMISE YOU TO MAKE NONE FOR MYSELF, PAPA; BUT I MUST, INDEED,
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.  IT IS THE GREATEST AMUSEMENT IN THE WORLD! AND
AFTER SUCH SUCCESS, YOU KNOW!--EVERY BODY SAID THAT MR. WESTON WOULD
NEVER MARRY AGAIN.  OH DEAR, NO! MR. WESTON, WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER
SO LONG, AND WHO SEEMED SO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A WIFE,
SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS
FRIENDS HERE, ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT, ALWAYS CHEERFUL--
MR. WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID
NOT LIKE IT.  OH NO! MR. WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN.
SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED,
AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM.  ALL MANNER
OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT, BUT I BELIEVED NONE
OF IT.

"EVER SINCE THE DAY--ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO--THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I
MET WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE, WHEN, BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE,
HE DARTED AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY, AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS
FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S, I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT.
I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR; AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED
ME IN THIS INSTANCE, DEAR PAPA, YOU CANNOT THINK THAT I SHALL LEAVE
OFF MATCH-MAKING."

"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY `SUCCESS,'" SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY.
"SUCCESS SUPPOSES ENDEAVOUR.  YOUR TIME HAS BEEN PROPERLY AND
DELICATELY SPENT, IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR
YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE.  A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG
LADY'S MIND! BUT IF, WHICH I RATHER IMAGINE, YOUR MAKING THE MATCH,
AS YOU CALL IT, MEANS ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT, YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF
ONE IDLE DAY, `I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR
IF MR. WESTON WERE TO MARRY HER,' AND SAYING IT AGAIN TO YOURSELF
EVERY NOW AND THEN AFTERWARDS, WHY DO YOU TALK OF SUCCESS? WHERE
IS YOUR MERIT? WHAT ARE YOU PROUD OF? YOU MADE A LUCKY GUESS;
AND _THAT_ IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID."

"AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS?--
I PITY YOU.--I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER--FOR, DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY
GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK.  THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT.
AND AS TO MY POOR WORD `SUCCESS,' WHICH YOU QUARREL WITH, I DO NOT
KNOW THAT I AM SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT ANY CLAIM TO IT.  YOU HAVE DRAWN
TWO PRETTY PICTURES; BUT I THINK THERE MAY BE A THIRD--A SOMETHING
BETWEEN THE DO-NOTHING AND THE DO-ALL. IF I HAD NOT PROMOTED MR. WESTON'S
VISITS HERE, AND GIVEN MANY LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENTS, AND SMOOTHED
MANY LITTLE MATTERS, IT MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TO ANY THING AFTER ALL.
I THINK YOU MUST KNOW HARTFIELD ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND THAT."

"A STRAIGHTFORWARD, OPEN-HEARTED MAN LIKE WESTON, AND A RATIONAL,
UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR, MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR
OWN CONCERNS.  YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF,
THAN GOOD TO THEM, BY INTERFERENCE."

"EMMA NEVER THINKS OF HERSELF, IF SHE CAN DO GOOD TO OTHERS,"
REJOINED MR. WOODHOUSE, UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART.  "BUT, MY DEAR,
PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES; THEY ARE SILLY THINGS, AND BREAK UP
ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY."

"ONLY ONE MORE, PAPA; ONLY FOR MR. ELTON.  POOR MR. ELTON! YOU
LIKE MR. ELTON, PAPA,--I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM.
THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM--AND HE HAS BEEN
HERE A WHOLE YEAR, AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY,
THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER--AND I THOUGHT
WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO-DAY, HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF
HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM! I THINK
VERY WELL OF MR. ELTON, AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING
HIM A SERVICE."

"MR. ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN, TO BE SURE, AND A VERY
GOOD YOUNG MAN, AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM.  BUT IF YOU
WANT TO SHEW HIM ANY ATTENTION, MY DEAR, ASK HIM TO COME
AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY.  THAT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING.
I DARE SAY MR. KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM."

"WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE, SIR, AT ANY TIME," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY,
LAUGHING, "AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY, THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH
BETTER THING.  INVITE HIM TO DINNER, EMMA, AND HELP HIM TO THE BEST
OF THE FISH AND THE CHICKEN, BUT LEAVE HIM TO CHUSE HIS OWN WIFE.
DEPEND UPON IT, A MAN OF SIX OR SEVEN-AND-TWENTY CAN TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF."



CHAPTER II


MR. WESTON WAS A NATIVE OF HIGHBURY, AND BORN OF A RESPECTABLE FAMILY,
WHICH FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS HAD BEEN RISING INTO
GENTILITY AND PROPERTY.  HE HAD RECEIVED A GOOD EDUCATION, BUT,
ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE, HAD BECOME
INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS
WERE ENGAGED, AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE, CHEERFUL MIND AND SOCIAL
TEMPER BY ENTERING INTO THE MILITIA OF HIS COUNTY, THEN EMBODIED.

CAPTAIN WESTON WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE; AND WHEN THE CHANCES
OF HIS MILITARY LIFE HAD INTRODUCED HIM TO MISS CHURCHILL,
OF A GREAT YORKSHIRE FAMILY, AND MISS CHURCHILL FELL IN LOVE
WITH HIM, NOBODY WAS SURPRIZED, EXCEPT HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE,
WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM, AND WHO WERE FULL OF PRIDE AND IMPORTANCE,
WHICH THE CONNEXION WOULD OFFEND.

MISS CHURCHILL, HOWEVER, BEING OF AGE, AND WITH THE FULL COMMAND
OF HER FORTUNE--THOUGH HER FORTUNE BORE NO PROPORTION TO THE
FAMILY-ESTATE--WAS NOT TO BE DISSUADED FROM THE MARRIAGE, AND IT
TOOK PLACE, TO THE INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MR. AND MRS. CHURCHILL,
WHO THREW HER OFF WITH DUE DECORUM.  IT WAS AN UNSUITABLE CONNEXION,
AND DID NOT PRODUCE MUCH HAPPINESS.  MRS. WESTON OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND
MORE IN IT, FOR SHE HAD A HUSBAND WHOSE WARM HEART AND SWEET TEMPER
MADE HIM THINK EVERY THING DUE TO HER IN RETURN FOR THE GREAT GOODNESS
OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM; BUT THOUGH SHE HAD ONE SORT OF SPIRIT,
SHE HAD NOT THE BEST.  SHE HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PURSUE
HER OWN WILL IN SPITE OF HER BROTHER, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REFRAIN
FROM UNREASONABLE REGRETS AT THAT BROTHER'S UNREASONABLE ANGER,
NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME.  THEY LIVED BEYOND
THEIR INCOME, BUT STILL IT WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF ENSCOMBE:
SHE DID NOT CEASE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND, BUT SHE WANTED AT ONCE
TO BE THE WIFE OF CAPTAIN WESTON, AND MISS CHURCHILL OF ENSCOMBE.

CAPTAIN WESTON, WHO HAD BEEN CONSIDERED, ESPECIALLY BY THE CHURCHILLS,
AS MAKING SUCH AN AMAZING MATCH, WAS PROVED TO HAVE MUCH THE WORST
OF THE BARGAIN; FOR WHEN HIS WIFE DIED, AFTER A THREE YEARS' MARRIAGE,
HE WAS RATHER A POORER MAN THAN AT FIRST, AND WITH A CHILD TO MAINTAIN.
FROM THE EXPENSE OF THE CHILD, HOWEVER, HE WAS SOON RELIEVED.
THE BOY HAD, WITH THE ADDITIONAL SOFTENING CLAIM OF A LINGERING
ILLNESS OF HIS MOTHER'S, BEEN THE MEANS OF A SORT OF RECONCILIATION;
AND MR. AND MRS. CHURCHILL, HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN,
NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR, OFFERED TO
TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE.
SOME SCRUPLES AND SOME RELUCTANCE THE WIDOWER-FATHER MAY BE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE FELT; BUT AS THEY WERE OVERCOME BY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS,
THE CHILD WAS GIVEN UP TO THE CARE AND THE WEALTH OF THE CHURCHILLS,
AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK, AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO
IMPROVE AS HE COULD.

A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE.  HE QUITTED THE MILITIA
AND ENGAGED IN TRADE, HAVING BROTHERS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN A
GOOD WAY IN LONDON, WHICH AFFORDED HIM A FAVOURABLE OPENING.
IT WAS A CONCERN WHICH BROUGHT JUST EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH.  HE HAD STILL
A SMALL HOUSE IN HIGHBURY, WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT;
AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY,
THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY.
HE HAD, BY THAT TIME, REALISED AN EASY COMPETENCE--ENOUGH TO SECURE
THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY, WHICH HE HAD
ALWAYS LONGED FOR--ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN
AS MISS TAYLOR, AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF HIS OWN
FRIENDLY AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION.

IT WAS NOW SOME TIME SINCE MISS TAYLOR HAD BEGUN TO INFLUENCE
HIS SCHEMES; BUT AS IT WAS NOT THE TYRANNIC INFLUENCE OF YOUTH
ON YOUTH, IT HAD NOT SHAKEN HIS DETERMINATION OF NEVER SETTLING
TILL HE COULD PURCHASE RANDALLS, AND THE SALE OF RANDALLS WAS LONG
LOOKED FORWARD TO; BUT HE HAD GONE STEADILY ON, WITH THESE OBJECTS
IN VIEW, TILL THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHED.  HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE,
BOUGHT HIS HOUSE, AND OBTAINED HIS WIFE; AND WAS BEGINNING A NEW
PERIOD OF EXISTENCE, WITH EVERY PROBABILITY OF GREATER HAPPINESS
THAN IN ANY YET PASSED THROUGH.  HE HAD NEVER BEEN AN UNHAPPY MAN;
HIS OWN TEMPER HAD SECURED HIM FROM THAT, EVEN IN HIS FIRST MARRIAGE;
BUT HIS SECOND MUST SHEW HIM HOW DELIGHTFUL A WELL-JUDGING AND TRULY
AMIABLE WOMAN COULD BE, AND MUST GIVE HIM THE PLEASANTEST PROOF
OF ITS BEING A GREAT DEAL BETTER TO CHOOSE THAN TO BE CHOSEN,
TO EXCITE GRATITUDE THAN TO FEEL IT.

HE HAD ONLY HIMSELF TO PLEASE IN HIS CHOICE: HIS FORTUNE WAS
HIS OWN; FOR AS TO FRANK, IT WAS MORE THAN BEING TACITLY BROUGHT
UP AS HIS UNCLE'S HEIR, IT HAD BECOME SO AVOWED AN ADOPTION
AS TO HAVE HIM ASSUME THE NAME OF CHURCHILL ON COMING OF AGE.
IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY, THEREFORE, THAT HE SHOULD EVER WANT HIS
FATHER'S ASSISTANCE.  HIS FATHER HAD NO APPREHENSION OF IT.
THE AUNT WAS A CAPRICIOUS WOMAN, AND GOVERNED HER HUSBAND ENTIRELY;
BUT IT WAS NOT IN MR. WESTON'S NATURE TO IMAGINE THAT ANY CAPRICE
COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO AFFECT ONE SO DEAR, AND, AS HE BELIEVED,
SO DESERVEDLY DEAR.  HE SAW HIS SON EVERY YEAR IN LONDON,
AND WAS PROUD OF HIM; AND HIS FOND REPORT OF HIM AS A VERY FINE
YOUNG MAN HAD MADE HIGHBURY FEEL A SORT OF PRIDE IN HIM TOO.
HE WAS LOOKED ON AS SUFFICIENTLY BELONGING TO THE PLACE TO MAKE HIS
MERITS AND PROSPECTS A KIND OF COMMON CONCERN.

MR. FRANK CHURCHILL WAS ONE OF THE BOASTS OF HIGHBURY, AND A LIVELY
CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM PREVAILED, THOUGH THE COMPLIMENT WAS SO LITTLE
RETURNED THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN THERE IN HIS LIFE.  HIS COMING
TO VISIT HIS FATHER HAD BEEN OFTEN TALKED OF BUT NEVER ACHIEVED.

NOW, UPON HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE, IT WAS VERY GENERALLY PROPOSED,
AS A MOST PROPER ATTENTION, THAT THE VISIT SHOULD TAKE PLACE.
THERE WAS NOT A DISSENTIENT VOICE ON THE SUBJECT, EITHER WHEN
MRS. PERRY DRANK TEA WITH MRS. AND MISS BATES, OR WHEN MRS. AND
MISS BATES RETURNED THE VISIT.  NOW WAS THE TIME FOR MR. FRANK
CHURCHILL TO COME AMONG THEM; AND THE HOPE STRENGTHENED WHEN IT WAS
UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION.
FOR A FEW DAYS, EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION
OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MRS. WESTON HAD RECEIVED.  "I SUPPOSE YOU
HAVE HEARD OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MR. FRANK CHURCHILL HAS WRITTEN
TO MRS. WESTON? I UNDERSTAND IT WAS A VERY HANDSOME LETTER, INDEED.
MR. WOODHOUSE TOLD ME OF IT.  MR. WOODHOUSE SAW THE LETTER, AND HE
SAYS HE NEVER SAW SUCH A HANDSOME LETTER IN HIS LIFE."

IT WAS, INDEED, A HIGHLY PRIZED LETTER.  MRS. WESTON HAD, OF COURSE,
FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN; AND SUCH A PLEASING
ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE,
AND A MOST WELCOME ADDITION TO EVERY SOURCE AND EVERY EXPRESSION
OF CONGRATULATION WHICH HER MARRIAGE HAD ALREADY SECURED.  SHE FELT
HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE WOMAN; AND SHE HAD LIVED LONG ENOUGH
TO KNOW HOW FORTUNATE SHE MIGHT WELL BE THOUGHT, WHERE THE ONLY
REGRET WAS FOR A PARTIAL SEPARATION FROM FRIENDS WHOSE FRIENDSHIP
FOR HER HAD NEVER COOLED, AND WHO COULD ILL BEAR TO PART WITH HER.

SHE KNEW THAT AT TIMES SHE MUST BE MISSED; AND COULD NOT THINK,
WITHOUT PAIN, OF EMMA'S LOSING A SINGLE PLEASURE, OR SUFFERING
AN HOUR'S ENNUI, FROM THE WANT OF HER COMPANIONABLENESS: BUT DEAR
EMMA WAS OF NO FEEBLE CHARACTER; SHE WAS MORE EQUAL TO HER SITUATION
THAN MOST GIRLS WOULD HAVE BEEN, AND HAD SENSE, AND ENERGY,
AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY
THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS.  AND THEN THERE WAS
SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD,
SO CONVENIENT FOR EVEN SOLITARY FEMALE WALKING, AND IN MR. WESTON'S
DISPOSITION AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH WOULD MAKE THE APPROACHING
SEASON NO HINDRANCE TO THEIR SPENDING HALF THE EVENINGS IN THE
WEEK TOGETHER.

HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE
TO MRS. WESTON, AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET; AND HER
SATISFACTION--HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION--HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT,
WAS SO JUST AND SO APPARENT, THAT EMMA, WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER,
WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE AT HIS BEING STILL ABLE TO PITY
`POOR MISS TAYLOR,' WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE
OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT, OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING
ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN.
BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MR. WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH,
AND SAYING, "AH, POOR MISS TAYLOR! SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY."

THERE WAS NO RECOVERING MISS TAYLOR--NOR MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF
CEASING TO PITY HER; BUT A FEW WEEKS BROUGHT SOME ALLEVIATION
TO MR. WOODHOUSE.  THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WERE OVER;
HE WAS NO LONGER TEASED BY BEING WISHED JOY OF SO SORROWFUL AN EVENT;
AND THE WEDDING-CAKE, WHICH HAD BEEN A GREAT DISTRESS TO HIM,
WAS ALL EAT UP.  HIS OWN STOMACH COULD BEAR NOTHING RICH, AND HE
COULD NEVER BELIEVE OTHER PEOPLE TO BE DIFFERENT FROM HIMSELF.
WHAT WAS UNWHOLESOME TO HIM HE REGARDED AS UNFIT FOR ANY BODY;
AND HE HAD, THEREFORE, EARNESTLY TRIED TO DISSUADE THEM FROM HAVING
ANY WEDDING-CAKE AT ALL, AND WHEN THAT PROVED VAIN, AS EARNESTLY
TRIED TO PREVENT ANY BODY'S EATING IT.  HE HAD BEEN AT THE PAINS
OF CONSULTING MR. PERRY, THE APOTHECARY, ON THE SUBJECT.  MR. PERRY
WAS AN INTELLIGENT, GENTLEMANLIKE MAN, WHOSE FREQUENT VISITS WERE ONE
OF THE COMFORTS OF MR. WOODHOUSE'S LIFE; AND UPON BEING APPLIED TO,
HE COULD NOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE (THOUGH IT SEEMED RATHER AGAINST THE
BIAS OF INCLINATION) THAT WEDDING-CAKE MIGHT CERTAINLY DISAGREE
WITH MANY--PERHAPS WITH MOST PEOPLE, UNLESS TAKEN MODERATELY.
WITH SUCH AN OPINION, IN CONFIRMATION OF HIS OWN, MR. WOODHOUSE HOPED
TO INFLUENCE EVERY VISITOR OF THE NEWLY MARRIED PAIR; BUT STILL THE
CAKE WAS EATEN; AND THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIS BENEVOLENT NERVES TILL
IT WAS ALL GONE.

THERE WAS A STRANGE RUMOUR IN HIGHBURY OF ALL THE LITTLE PERRYS
BEING SEEN WITH A SLICE OF MRS. WESTON'S WEDDING-CAKE IN THEIR
HANDS: BUT MR. WOODHOUSE WOULD NEVER BELIEVE IT.



CHAPTER III


MR. WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY.  HE LIKED VERY MUCH
TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM; AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES,
FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD, AND HIS GOOD NATURE,
FROM HIS FORTUNE, HIS HOUSE, AND HIS DAUGHTER, HE COULD COMMAND THE
VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE, IN A GREAT MEASURE, AS HE LIKED.
HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE;
HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS, AND LARGE DINNER-PARTIES, MADE HIM UNFIT
FOR ANY ACQUAINTANCE BUT SUCH AS WOULD VISIT HIM ON HIS OWN TERMS.
FORTUNATELY FOR HIM, HIGHBURY, INCLUDING RANDALLS IN THE SAME PARISH,
AND DONWELL ABBEY IN THE PARISH ADJOINING, THE SEAT OF MR. KNIGHTLEY,
COMPREHENDED MANY SUCH.  NOT UNFREQUENTLY, THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION,
HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM: BUT EVENING
PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED; AND, UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY
TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY, THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK
IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD-TABLE FOR HIM.

REAL, LONG-STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MR. KNIGHTLEY;
AND BY MR. ELTON, A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT,
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE
FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MR. WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING-ROOM,
AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER, WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING
THROWN AWAY.

AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET; AMONG THE MOST COME-AT-ABLE
OF WHOM WERE MRS. AND MISS BATES, AND MRS. GODDARD, THREE LADIES
ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD,
AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN, THAT MR. WOODHOUSE
THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES.  HAD IT
TAKEN PLACE ONLY ONCE A YEAR, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRIEVANCE.

MRS. BATES, THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY, WAS A
VERY OLD LADY, ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE.
SHE LIVED WITH HER SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY, AND WAS
CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY,
UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES, CAN EXCITE.  HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED
A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE OF POPULARITY FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG,
HANDSOME, RICH, NOR MARRIED.  MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST
PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR;
AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF,
OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT.
SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS.  HER YOUTH
HAD PASSED WITHOUT DISTINCTION, AND HER MIDDLE OF LIFE WAS DEVOTED
TO THE CARE OF A FAILING MOTHER, AND THE ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE A SMALL
INCOME GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE.  AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN,
AND A WOMAN WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD-WILL.  IT WAS HER OWN
UNIVERSAL GOOD-WILL AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS.
SHE LOVED EVERY BODY, WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS,
QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS; THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE
CREATURE, AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER,
AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS, AND A HOME THAT WANTED
FOR NOTHING.  THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE,
HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT, WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY,
AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF.  SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON
LITTLE MATTERS, WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MR. WOODHOUSE, FULL OF TRIVIAL
COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP.

MRS. GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL--NOT OF A SEMINARY,
OR AN ESTABLISHMENT, OR ANY THING WHICH PROFESSED, IN LONG SENTENCES OF
REFINED NONSENSE, TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY,
UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS--AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR
ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY--BUT
A REAL, HONEST, OLD-FASHIONED BOARDING-SCHOOL, WHERE A REASONABLE
QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE,
AND WHERE GIRLS MIGHT BE SENT TO BE OUT OF THE WAY, AND SCRAMBLE
THEMSELVES INTO A LITTLE EDUCATION, WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF COMING
BACK PRODIGIES.  MRS. GODDARD'S SCHOOL WAS IN HIGH REPUTE--AND
VERY DESERVEDLY; FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY
SPOT: SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN, GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY
OF WHOLESOME FOOD, LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER,
AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN HANDS.
IT WAS NO WONDER THAT A TRAIN OF TWENTY YOUNG COUPLE NOW WALKED
AFTER HER TO CHURCH.  SHE WAS A PLAIN, MOTHERLY KIND OF WOMAN,
WHO HAD WORKED HARD IN HER YOUTH, AND NOW THOUGHT HERSELF ENTITLED
TO THE OCCASIONAL HOLIDAY OF A TEA-VISIT; AND HAVING FORMERLY
OWED MUCH TO MR. WOODHOUSE'S KINDNESS, FELT HIS PARTICULAR CLAIM
ON HER TO LEAVE HER NEAT PARLOUR, HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY-WORK,
WHENEVER SHE COULD, AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE.

THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY
ABLE TO COLLECT; AND HAPPY WAS SHE, FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE,
IN THE POWER; THOUGH, AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED,
IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MRS. WESTON.  SHE WAS DELIGHTED
TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE, AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH
HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL; BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS
OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT
WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED.

AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING, LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE
OF THE PRESENT DAY, A NOTE WAS BROUGHT FROM MRS. GODDARD, REQUESTING,
IN MOST RESPECTFUL TERMS, TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER;
A MOST WELCOME REQUEST: FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN,
WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT, AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN,
ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY.  A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED,
AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION.

HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY.  SOMEBODY HAD
PLACED HER, SEVERAL YEARS BACK, AT MRS. GODDARD'S SCHOOL,
AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR
TO THAT OF PARLOUR-BOARDER. THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN
OF HER HISTORY.  SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN
ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY, AND WAS NOW JUST RETURNED FROM A LONG VISIT
IN THE COUNTRY TO SOME YOUNG LADIES WHO HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL THERE WITH HER.

SHE WAS A VERY PRETTY GIRL, AND HER BEAUTY HAPPENED TO BE OF A SORT
WHICH EMMA PARTICULARLY ADMIRED.  SHE WAS SHORT, PLUMP, AND FAIR,
WITH A FINE BLOOM, BLUE EYES, LIGHT HAIR, REGULAR FEATURES,
AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS, AND, BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING,
EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON, AND QUITE
DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE.

SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S
CONVERSATION, BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING--NOT
INCONVENIENTLY SHY, NOT UNWILLING TO TALK--AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING,
SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE, SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY
GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD, AND SO ARTLESSLY
IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE
TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO, THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE,
AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT.  ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN.
THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES, AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES, SHOULD NOT BE
WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS.
THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER.
THE FRIENDS FROM WHOM SHE HAD JUST PARTED, THOUGH VERY GOOD SORT
OF PEOPLE, MUST BE DOING HER HARM.  THEY WERE A FAMILY OF THE NAME
OF MARTIN, WHOM EMMA WELL KNEW BY CHARACTER, AS RENTING A LARGE FARM
OF MR. KNIGHTLEY, AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL--VERY CREDITABLY,
SHE BELIEVED--SHE KNEW MR. KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM--BUT THEY
MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED, AND VERY UNFIT TO BE THE INTIMATES
OF A GIRL WHO WANTED ONLY A LITTLE MORE KNOWLEDGE AND ELEGANCE
TO BE QUITE PERFECT.  _SHE_ WOULD NOTICE HER; SHE WOULD IMPROVE HER;
SHE WOULD DETACH HER FROM HER BAD ACQUAINTANCE, AND INTRODUCE HER
INTO GOOD SOCIETY; SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS.
IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING, AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING;
HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE, HER LEISURE, AND POWERS.

SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES, IN TALKING
AND LISTENING, AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN-BETWEENS, THAT
THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE; AND THE SUPPER-TABLE,
WHICH ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES, AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN
USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME, WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY,
AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE, BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE.  WITH AN
ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT WHICH YET WAS NEVER
INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY,
WITH THE REAL GOOD-WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS,
DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL, AND HELP AND RECOMMEND
THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS, WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE
KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS.

UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MR. WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE.
HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID, BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION
OF HIS YOUTH, BUT HIS CONVICTION OF SUPPERS BEING VERY UNWHOLESOME
MADE HIM RATHER SORRY TO SEE ANY THING PUT ON IT; AND WHILE HIS
HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING,
HIS CARE FOR THEIR HEALTH MADE HIM GRIEVE THAT THEY WOULD EAT.

SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT
HE COULD, WITH THOROUGH SELF-APPROBATION, RECOMMEND; THOUGH HE
MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF, WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING
THE NICER THINGS, TO SAY:

"MRS. BATES, LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS.
AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME.  SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING
AN EGG BETTER THAN ANY BODY.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED
BY ANY BODY ELSE; BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID, THEY ARE VERY SMALL,
YOU SEE--ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU.  MISS BATES,
LET EMMA HELP YOU TO A _LITTLE_ BIT OF TART--A _VERY_ LITTLE BIT.
OURS ARE ALL APPLE-TARTS. YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF UNWHOLESOME
PRESERVES HERE.  I DO NOT ADVISE THE CUSTARD.  MRS. GODDARD, WHAT SAY
YOU TO _HALF_ A GLASS OF WINE? A _SMALL_ HALF-GLASS, PUT INTO A TUMBLER
OF WATER? I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU."

EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK--BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN
A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE, AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD
PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY.  THE HAPPINESS
OF MISS SMITH WAS QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS.  MISS WOODHOUSE
WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE IN HIGHBURY, THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE
INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH PANIC AS PLEASURE; BUT THE HUMBLE,
GRATEFUL LITTLE GIRL WENT OFF WITH HIGHLY GRATIFIED FEELINGS,
DELIGHTED WITH THE AFFABILITY WITH WHICH MISS WOODHOUSE HAD TREATED
HER ALL THE EVENING, AND ACTUALLY SHAKEN HANDS WITH HER AT LAST!



CHAPTER IV


HARRIET SMITH'S INTIMACY AT HARTFIELD WAS SOON A SETTLED THING.
QUICK AND DECIDED IN HER WAYS, EMMA LOST NO TIME IN INVITING, ENCOURAGING,
AND TELLING HER TO COME VERY OFTEN; AND AS THEIR ACQUAINTANCE INCREASED,
SO DID THEIR SATISFACTION IN EACH OTHER.  AS A WALKING COMPANION,
EMMA HAD VERY EARLY FORESEEN HOW USEFUL SHE MIGHT FIND HER.
IN THAT RESPECT MRS. WESTON'S LOSS HAD BEEN IMPORTANT.  HER FATHER
NEVER WENT BEYOND THE SHRUBBERY, WHERE TWO DIVISIONS OF THE GROUND
SUFFICED HIM FOR HIS LONG WALK, OR HIS SHORT, AS THE YEAR VARIED;
AND SINCE MRS. WESTON'S MARRIAGE HER EXERCISE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH CONFINED.
SHE HAD VENTURED ONCE ALONE TO RANDALLS, BUT IT WAS NOT PLEASANT;
AND A HARRIET SMITH, THEREFORE, ONE WHOM SHE COULD SUMMON AT ANY
TIME TO A WALK, WOULD BE A VALUABLE ADDITION TO HER PRIVILEGES.
BUT IN EVERY RESPECT, AS SHE SAW MORE OF HER, SHE APPROVED HER,
AND WAS CONFIRMED IN ALL HER KIND DESIGNS.

HARRIET CERTAINLY WAS NOT CLEVER, BUT SHE HAD A SWEET, DOCILE,
GRATEFUL DISPOSITION, WAS TOTALLY FREE FROM CONCEIT, AND ONLY DESIRING
TO BE GUIDED BY ANY ONE SHE LOOKED UP TO.  HER EARLY ATTACHMENT
TO HERSELF WAS VERY AMIABLE; AND HER INCLINATION FOR GOOD COMPANY,
AND POWER OF APPRECIATING WHAT WAS ELEGANT AND CLEVER, SHEWED THAT
THERE WAS NO WANT OF TASTE, THOUGH STRENGTH OF UNDERSTANDING MUST
NOT BE EXPECTED.  ALTOGETHER SHE WAS QUITE CONVINCED OF HARRIET
SMITH'S BEING EXACTLY THE YOUNG FRIEND SHE WANTED--EXACTLY THE
SOMETHING WHICH HER HOME REQUIRED.  SUCH A FRIEND AS MRS. WESTON
WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION.  TWO SUCH COULD NEVER BE GRANTED.
TWO SUCH SHE DID NOT WANT.  IT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF THING,
A SENTIMENT DISTINCT AND INDEPENDENT.  MRS. WESTON WAS THE OBJECT
OF A REGARD WHICH HAD ITS BASIS IN GRATITUDE AND ESTEEM.
HARRIET WOULD BE LOVED AS ONE TO WHOM SHE COULD BE USEFUL.
FOR MRS. WESTON THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE; FOR HARRIET EVERY THING.

HER FIRST ATTEMPTS AT USEFULNESS WERE IN AN ENDEAVOUR TO FIND OUT WHO
WERE THE PARENTS, BUT HARRIET COULD NOT TELL.  SHE WAS READY TO TELL
EVERY THING IN HER POWER, BUT ON THIS SUBJECT QUESTIONS WERE VAIN.
EMMA WAS OBLIGED TO FANCY WHAT SHE LIKED--BUT SHE COULD NEVER
BELIEVE THAT IN THE SAME SITUATION _SHE_ SHOULD NOT HAVE DISCOVERED
THE TRUTH.  HARRIET HAD NO PENETRATION.  SHE HAD BEEN SATISFIED
TO HEAR AND BELIEVE JUST WHAT MRS. GODDARD CHOSE TO TELL HER;
AND LOOKED NO FARTHER.

MRS. GODDARD, AND THE TEACHERS, AND THE GIRLS AND THE AFFAIRS OF THE
SCHOOL IN GENERAL, FORMED NATURALLY A GREAT PART OF THE CONVERSATION--AND
BUT FOR HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MARTINS OF ABBEY-MILL FARM,
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE WHOLE.  BUT THE MARTINS OCCUPIED HER THOUGHTS
A GOOD DEAL; SHE HAD SPENT TWO VERY HAPPY MONTHS WITH THEM,
AND NOW LOVED TO TALK OF THE PLEASURES OF HER VISIT, AND DESCRIBE
THE MANY COMFORTS AND WONDERS OF THE PLACE.  EMMA ENCOURAGED HER
TALKATIVENESS--AMUSED BY SUCH A PICTURE OF ANOTHER SET OF BEINGS,
AND ENJOYING THE YOUTHFUL SIMPLICITY WHICH COULD SPEAK WITH SO MUCH
EXULTATION OF MRS. MARTIN'S HAVING "_TWO_ PARLOURS, TWO VERY GOOD PARLOURS,
INDEED; ONE OF THEM QUITE AS LARGE AS MRS. GODDARD'S DRAWING-ROOM;
AND OF HER HAVING AN UPPER MAID WHO HAD LIVED FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS
WITH HER; AND OF THEIR HAVING EIGHT COWS, TWO OF THEM ALDERNEYS,
AND ONE A LITTLE WELCH COW, A VERY PRETTY LITTLE WELCH COW INDEED;
AND OF MRS. MARTIN'S SAYING AS SHE WAS SO FOND OF IT, IT SHOULD BE
CALLED _HER_ COW; AND OF THEIR HAVING A VERY HANDSOME SUMMER-HOUSE
IN THEIR GARDEN, WHERE SOME DAY NEXT YEAR THEY WERE ALL TO DRINK
TEA:--A VERY HANDSOME SUMMER-HOUSE, LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD A DOZEN PEOPLE."

FOR SOME TIME SHE WAS AMUSED, WITHOUT THINKING BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE;
BUT AS SHE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THE FAMILY BETTER, OTHER FEELINGS AROSE.
SHE HAD TAKEN UP A WRONG IDEA, FANCYING IT WAS A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER,
A SON AND SON'S WIFE, WHO ALL LIVED TOGETHER; BUT WHEN IT APPEARED
THAT THE MR. MARTIN, WHO BORE A PART IN THE NARRATIVE, AND WAS ALWAYS
MENTIONED WITH APPROBATION FOR HIS GREAT GOOD-NATURE IN DOING SOMETHING
OR OTHER, WAS A SINGLE MAN; THAT THERE WAS NO YOUNG MRS. MARTIN,
NO WIFE IN THE CASE; SHE DID SUSPECT DANGER TO HER POOR LITTLE
FRIEND FROM ALL THIS HOSPITALITY AND KINDNESS, AND THAT, IF SHE
WERE NOT TAKEN CARE OF, SHE MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO SINK HERSELF FOREVER.

WITH THIS INSPIRITING NOTION, HER QUESTIONS INCREASED IN NUMBER
AND MEANING; AND SHE PARTICULARLY LED HARRIET TO TALK MORE OF MR. MARTIN,
AND THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NO DISLIKE TO IT.  HARRIET WAS VERY READY
TO SPEAK OF THE SHARE HE HAD HAD IN THEIR MOONLIGHT WALKS AND MERRY
EVENING GAMES; AND DWELT A GOOD DEAL UPON HIS BEING SO VERY GOOD-HUMOURED
AND OBLIGING.  HE HAD GONE THREE MILES ROUND ONE DAY IN ORDER TO BRING
HER SOME WALNUTS, BECAUSE SHE HAD SAID HOW FOND SHE WAS OF THEM,
AND IN EVERY THING ELSE HE WAS SO VERY OBLIGING.  HE HAD HIS
SHEPHERD'S SON INTO THE PARLOUR ONE NIGHT ON PURPOSE TO SING TO HER.
SHE WAS VERY FOND OF SINGING.  HE COULD SING A LITTLE HIMSELF.
SHE BELIEVED HE WAS VERY CLEVER, AND UNDERSTOOD EVERY THING.
HE HAD A VERY FINE FLOCK, AND, WHILE SHE WAS WITH THEM,
HE HAD BEEN BID MORE FOR HIS WOOL THAN ANY BODY IN THE COUNTRY.
SHE BELIEVED EVERY BODY SPOKE WELL OF HIM.  HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS
WERE VERY FOND OF HIM.  MRS. MARTIN HAD TOLD HER ONE DAY (AND THERE
WAS A BLUSH AS SHE SAID IT,) THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY BODY
TO BE A BETTER SON, AND THEREFORE SHE WAS SURE, WHENEVER HE MARRIED,
HE WOULD MAKE A GOOD HUSBAND.  NOT THAT SHE _WANTED_ HIM TO MARRY.
SHE WAS IN NO HURRY AT ALL.

"WELL DONE, MRS. MARTIN!" THOUGHT EMMA.  "YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT."

"AND WHEN SHE HAD COME AWAY, MRS. MARTIN WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO SEND
MRS. GODDARD A BEAUTIFUL GOOSE--THE FINEST GOOSE MRS. GODDARD HAD
EVER SEEN.  MRS. GODDARD HAD DRESSED IT ON A SUNDAY, AND ASKED ALL
THE THREE TEACHERS, MISS NASH, AND MISS PRINCE, AND MISS RICHARDSON,
TO SUP WITH HER."

"MR. MARTIN, I SUPPOSE, IS NOT A MAN OF INFORMATION BEYOND THE LINE
OF HIS OWN BUSINESS? HE DOES NOT READ?"

"OH YES!--THAT IS, NO--I DO NOT KNOW--BUT I BELIEVE HE HAS
READ A GOOD DEAL--BUT NOT WHAT YOU WOULD THINK ANY THING OF.
HE READS THE AGRICULTURAL REPORTS, AND SOME OTHER BOOKS THAT LAY
IN ONE OF THE WINDOW SEATS--BUT HE READS ALL _THEM_ TO HIMSELF.
BUT SOMETIMES OF AN EVENING, BEFORE WE WENT TO CARDS, HE WOULD READ
SOMETHING ALOUD OUT OF THE ELEGANT EXTRACTS, VERY ENTERTAINING.
AND I KNOW HE HAS READ THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD.  HE NEVER READ THE
ROMANCE OF THE FOREST, NOR THE CHILDREN OF THE ABBEY.  HE HAD NEVER
HEARD OF SUCH BOOKS BEFORE I MENTIONED THEM, BUT HE IS DETERMINED
TO GET THEM NOW AS SOON AS EVER HE CAN."

THE NEXT QUESTION WAS--

"WHAT SORT OF LOOKING MAN IS MR. MARTIN?"

"OH! NOT HANDSOME--NOT AT ALL HANDSOME.  I THOUGHT HIM VERY PLAIN
AT FIRST, BUT I DO NOT THINK HIM SO PLAIN NOW.  ONE DOES NOT, YOU KNOW,
AFTER A TIME.  BUT DID YOU NEVER SEE HIM? HE IS IN HIGHBURY EVERY
NOW AND THEN, AND HE IS SURE TO RIDE THROUGH EVERY WEEK IN HIS WAY
TO KINGSTON.  HE HAS PASSED YOU VERY OFTEN."

"THAT MAY BE, AND I MAY HAVE SEEN HIM FIFTY TIMES, BUT WITHOUT
HAVING ANY IDEA OF HIS NAME.  A YOUNG FARMER, WHETHER ON HORSEBACK
OR ON FOOT, IS THE VERY LAST SORT OF PERSON TO RAISE MY CURIOSITY.
THE YEOMANRY ARE PRECISELY THE ORDER OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM I FEEL I
CAN HAVE NOTHING TO DO.  A DEGREE OR TWO LOWER, AND A CREDITABLE
APPEARANCE MIGHT INTEREST ME; I MIGHT HOPE TO BE USEFUL TO THEIR
FAMILIES IN SOME WAY OR OTHER.  BUT A FARMER CAN NEED NONE OF MY HELP,
AND IS, THEREFORE, IN ONE SENSE, AS MUCH ABOVE MY NOTICE AS IN EVERY
OTHER HE IS BELOW IT."

"TO BE SURE.  OH YES! IT IS NOT LIKELY YOU SHOULD EVER HAVE
OBSERVED HIM; BUT HE KNOWS YOU VERY WELL INDEED--I MEAN BY SIGHT."

"I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING A VERY RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN.
I KNOW, INDEED, THAT HE IS SO, AND, AS SUCH, WISH HIM WELL.
WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE HIS AGE TO BE?"

"HE WAS FOUR-AND-TWENTY THE 8TH OF LAST JUNE, AND MY BIRTHDAY IS
THE 23RD JUST A FORTNIGHT AND A DAY'S DIFFERENCE--WHICH IS VERY ODD."

"ONLY FOUR-AND-TWENTY. THAT IS TOO YOUNG TO SETTLE.  HIS MOTHER IS
PERFECTLY RIGHT NOT TO BE IN A HURRY.  THEY SEEM VERY COMFORTABLE
AS THEY ARE, AND IF SHE WERE TO TAKE ANY PAINS TO MARRY HIM,
SHE WOULD PROBABLY REPENT IT.  SIX YEARS HENCE, IF HE COULD MEET
WITH A GOOD SORT OF YOUNG WOMAN IN THE SAME RANK AS HIS OWN,
WITH A LITTLE MONEY, IT MIGHT BE VERY DESIRABLE."

"SIX YEARS HENCE! DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, HE WOULD BE THIRTY YEARS OLD!"

"WELL, AND THAT IS AS EARLY AS MOST MEN CAN AFFORD TO MARRY,
WHO ARE NOT BORN TO AN INDEPENDENCE.  MR. MARTIN, I IMAGINE,
HAS HIS FORTUNE ENTIRELY TO MAKE--CANNOT BE AT ALL BEFOREHAND WITH
THE WORLD.  WHATEVER MONEY HE MIGHT COME INTO WHEN HIS FATHER DIED,
WHATEVER HIS SHARE OF THE FAMILY PROPERTY, IT IS, I DARE SAY,
ALL AFLOAT, ALL EMPLOYED IN HIS STOCK, AND SO FORTH; AND THOUGH,
WITH DILIGENCE AND GOOD LUCK, HE MAY BE RICH IN TIME, IT IS NEXT TO
IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE REALISED ANY THING YET."

"TO BE SURE, SO IT IS.  BUT THEY LIVE VERY COMFORTABLY.
THEY HAVE NO INDOORS MAN, ELSE THEY DO NOT WANT FOR ANY THING;
AND MRS. MARTIN TALKS OF TAKING A BOY ANOTHER YEAR."

"I WISH YOU MAY NOT GET INTO A SCRAPE, HARRIET, WHENEVER HE DOES
MARRY;--I MEAN, AS TO BEING ACQUAINTED WITH HIS WIFE--FOR THOUGH
HIS SISTERS, FROM A SUPERIOR EDUCATION, ARE NOT TO BE ALTOGETHER
OBJECTED TO, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT HE MIGHT MARRY ANY BODY AT ALL FIT
FOR YOU TO NOTICE.  THE MISFORTUNE OF YOUR BIRTH OUGHT TO MAKE YOU
PARTICULARLY CAREFUL AS TO YOUR ASSOCIATES.  THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
OF YOUR BEING A GENTLEMAN'S DAUGHTER, AND YOU MUST SUPPORT YOUR
CLAIM TO THAT STATION BY EVERY THING WITHIN YOUR OWN POWER, OR THERE
WILL BE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN DEGRADING YOU."

"YES, TO BE SURE, I SUPPOSE THERE ARE.  BUT WHILE I VISIT
AT HARTFIELD, AND YOU ARE SO KIND TO ME, MISS WOODHOUSE,
I AM NOT AFRAID OF WHAT ANY BODY CAN DO."

"YOU UNDERSTAND THE FORCE OF INFLUENCE PRETTY WELL, HARRIET; BUT I
WOULD HAVE YOU SO FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN GOOD SOCIETY, AS TO BE
INDEPENDENT EVEN OF HARTFIELD AND MISS WOODHOUSE.  I WANT TO SEE YOU
PERMANENTLY WELL CONNECTED, AND TO THAT END IT WILL BE ADVISABLE
TO HAVE AS FEW ODD ACQUAINTANCE AS MAY BE; AND, THEREFORE, I SAY
THAT IF YOU SHOULD STILL BE IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN MR. MARTIN MARRIES,
I WISH YOU MAY NOT BE DRAWN IN BY YOUR INTIMACY WITH THE SISTERS,
TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE WIFE, WHO WILL PROBABLY BE SOME MERE
FARMER'S DAUGHTER, WITHOUT EDUCATION."

"TO BE SURE.  YES.  NOT THAT I THINK MR. MARTIN WOULD EVER MARRY ANY BODY
BUT WHAT HAD HAD SOME EDUCATION--AND BEEN VERY WELL BROUGHT UP.
HOWEVER, I DO NOT MEAN TO SET UP MY OPINION AGAINST YOUR'S--AND I
AM SURE I SHALL NOT WISH FOR THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS WIFE.  I SHALL
ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR THE MISS MARTINS, ESPECIALLY ELIZABETH,
AND SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO GIVE THEM UP, FOR THEY ARE QUITE AS WELL
EDUCATED AS ME.  BUT IF HE MARRIES A VERY IGNORANT, VULGAR WOMAN,
CERTAINLY I HAD BETTER NOT VISIT HER, IF I CAN HELP IT."

EMMA WATCHED HER THROUGH THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THIS SPEECH,
AND SAW NO ALARMING SYMPTOMS OF LOVE.  THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN
THE FIRST ADMIRER, BUT SHE TRUSTED THERE WAS NO OTHER HOLD,
AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO SERIOUS DIFFICULTY, ON HARRIET'S SIDE,
TO OPPOSE ANY FRIENDLY ARRANGEMENT OF HER OWN.

THEY MET MR. MARTIN THE VERY NEXT DAY, AS THEY WERE WALKING ON THE
DONWELL ROAD.  HE WAS ON FOOT, AND AFTER LOOKING VERY RESPECTFULLY
AT HER, LOOKED WITH MOST UNFEIGNED SATISFACTION AT HER COMPANION.
EMMA WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF SURVEY;
AND WALKING A FEW YARDS FORWARD, WHILE THEY TALKED TOGETHER, SOON MADE
HER QUICK EYE SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH MR. ROBERT MARTIN.
HIS APPEARANCE WAS VERY NEAT, AND HE LOOKED LIKE A SENSIBLE YOUNG MAN,
BUT HIS PERSON HAD NO OTHER ADVANTAGE; AND WHEN HE CAME TO BE
CONTRASTED WITH GENTLEMEN, SHE THOUGHT HE MUST LOSE ALL THE GROUND
HE HAD GAINED IN HARRIET'S INCLINATION.  HARRIET WAS NOT INSENSIBLE
OF MANNER; SHE HAD VOLUNTARILY NOTICED HER FATHER'S GENTLENESS
WITH ADMIRATION AS WELL AS WONDER.  MR. MARTIN LOOKED AS IF HE
DID NOT KNOW WHAT MANNER WAS.

THEY REMAINED BUT A FEW MINUTES TOGETHER, AS MISS WOODHOUSE MUST
NOT BE KEPT WAITING; AND HARRIET THEN CAME RUNNING TO HER WITH A
SMILING FACE, AND IN A FLUTTER OF SPIRITS, WHICH MISS WOODHOUSE
HOPED VERY SOON TO COMPOSE.

"ONLY THINK OF OUR HAPPENING TO MEET HIM!--HOW VERY ODD! IT WAS
QUITE A CHANCE, HE SAID, THAT HE HAD NOT GONE ROUND BY RANDALLS.
HE DID NOT THINK WE EVER WALKED THIS ROAD.  HE THOUGHT WE WALKED
TOWARDS RANDALLS MOST DAYS.  HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE
ROMANCE OF THE FOREST YET.  HE WAS SO BUSY THE LAST TIME HE WAS
AT KINGSTON THAT HE QUITE FORGOT IT, BUT HE GOES AGAIN TO-MORROW.
SO VERY ODD WE SHOULD HAPPEN TO MEET! WELL, MISS WOODHOUSE, IS HE
LIKE WHAT YOU EXPECTED? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM? DO YOU THINK HIM
SO VERY PLAIN?"

"HE IS VERY PLAIN, UNDOUBTEDLY--REMARKABLY PLAIN:--BUT THAT IS
NOTHING COMPARED WITH HIS ENTIRE WANT OF GENTILITY.  I HAD NO
RIGHT TO EXPECT MUCH, AND I DID NOT EXPECT MUCH; BUT I HAD NO
IDEA THAT HE COULD BE SO VERY CLOWNISH, SO TOTALLY WITHOUT AIR.
I HAD IMAGINED HIM, I CONFESS, A DEGREE OR TWO NEARER GENTILITY."

"TO BE SURE," SAID HARRIET, IN A MORTIFIED VOICE, "HE IS NOT
SO GENTEEL AS REAL GENTLEMEN."

"I THINK, HARRIET, SINCE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH US, YOU HAVE BEEN
REPEATEDLY IN THE COMPANY OF SOME SUCH VERY REAL GENTLEMEN,
THAT YOU MUST YOURSELF BE STRUCK WITH THE DIFFERENCE IN MR. MARTIN.
AT HARTFIELD, YOU HAVE HAD VERY GOOD SPECIMENS OF WELL EDUCATED,
WELL BRED MEN.  I SHOULD BE SURPRIZED IF, AFTER SEEING THEM,
YOU COULD BE IN COMPANY WITH MR. MARTIN AGAIN WITHOUT PERCEIVING
HIM TO BE A VERY INFERIOR CREATURE--AND RATHER WONDERING AT
YOURSELF FOR HAVING EVER THOUGHT HIM AT ALL AGREEABLE BEFORE.
DO NOT YOU BEGIN TO FEEL THAT NOW? WERE NOT YOU STRUCK? I AM SURE
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY HIS AWKWARD LOOK AND ABRUPT MANNER,
AND THE UNCOUTHNESS OF A VOICE WHICH I HEARD TO BE WHOLLY UNMODULATED
AS I STOOD HERE."

"CERTAINLY, HE IS NOT LIKE MR. KNIGHTLEY.  HE HAS NOT SUCH A FINE
AIR AND WAY OF WALKING AS MR. KNIGHTLEY.  I SEE THE DIFFERENCE
PLAIN ENOUGH.  BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY IS SO VERY FINE A MAN!"

"MR. KNIGHTLEY'S AIR IS SO REMARKABLY GOOD THAT IT IS NOT FAIR
TO COMPARE MR. MARTIN WITH _HIM_.  YOU MIGHT NOT SEE ONE IN A HUNDRED
WITH _GENTLEMAN_ SO PLAINLY WRITTEN AS IN MR. KNIGHTLEY.  BUT HE IS
NOT THE ONLY GENTLEMAN YOU HAVE BEEN LATELY USED TO.  WHAT SAY YOU
TO MR. WESTON AND MR. ELTON? COMPARE MR. MARTIN WITH EITHER OF _THEM_.
COMPARE THEIR MANNER OF CARRYING THEMSELVES; OF WALKING; OF SPEAKING;
OF BEING SILENT.  YOU MUST SEE THE DIFFERENCE."

"OH YES!--THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE.  BUT MR. WESTON IS ALMOST
AN OLD MAN.  MR. WESTON MUST BE BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY."

"WHICH MAKES HIS GOOD MANNERS THE MORE VALUABLE.  THE OLDER A
PERSON GROWS, HARRIET, THE MORE IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THEIR MANNERS
SHOULD NOT BE BAD; THE MORE GLARING AND DISGUSTING ANY LOUDNESS,
OR COARSENESS, OR AWKWARDNESS BECOMES.  WHAT IS PASSABLE IN YOUTH
IS DETESTABLE IN LATER AGE.  MR. MARTIN IS NOW AWKWARD AND ABRUPT;
WHAT WILL HE BE AT MR. WESTON'S TIME OF LIFE?"

"THERE IS NO SAYING, INDEED," REPLIED HARRIET RATHER SOLEMNLY.

"BUT THERE MAY BE PRETTY GOOD GUESSING.  HE WILL BE A COMPLETELY GROSS,
VULGAR FARMER, TOTALLY INATTENTIVE TO APPEARANCES, AND THINKING
OF NOTHING BUT PROFIT AND LOSS."

"WILL HE, INDEED? THAT WILL BE VERY BAD."

"HOW MUCH HIS BUSINESS ENGROSSES HIM ALREADY IS VERY PLAIN FROM THE
CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS FORGETTING TO INQUIRE FOR THE BOOK YOU RECOMMENDED.
HE WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO FULL OF THE MARKET TO THINK OF ANY THING
ELSE--WHICH IS JUST AS IT SHOULD BE, FOR A THRIVING MAN.  WHAT HAS
HE TO DO WITH BOOKS? AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE _WILL_ THRIVE,
AND BE A VERY RICH MAN IN TIME--AND HIS BEING ILLITERATE AND COARSE
NEED NOT DISTURB _US_."

"I WONDER HE DID NOT REMEMBER THE BOOK"--WAS ALL HARRIET'S ANSWER,
AND SPOKEN WITH A DEGREE OF GRAVE DISPLEASURE WHICH EMMA THOUGHT MIGHT
BE SAFELY LEFT TO ITSELF.  SHE, THEREFORE, SAID NO MORE FOR SOME TIME.
HER NEXT BEGINNING WAS,

"IN ONE RESPECT, PERHAPS, MR. ELTON'S MANNERS ARE SUPERIOR
TO MR. KNIGHTLEY'S OR MR. WESTON'S. THEY HAVE MORE GENTLENESS.
THEY MIGHT BE MORE SAFELY HELD UP AS A PATTERN.  THERE IS AN OPENNESS,
A QUICKNESS, ALMOST A BLUNTNESS IN MR. WESTON, WHICH EVERY BODY
LIKES IN _HIM_, BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH GOOD-HUMOUR WITH IT--BUT
THAT WOULD NOT DO TO BE COPIED.  NEITHER WOULD MR. KNIGHTLEY'S
DOWNRIGHT, DECIDED, COMMANDING SORT OF MANNER, THOUGH IT SUITS
_HIM_ VERY WELL; HIS FIGURE, AND LOOK, AND SITUATION IN LIFE SEEM
TO ALLOW IT; BUT IF ANY YOUNG MAN WERE TO SET ABOUT COPYING HIM,
HE WOULD NOT BE SUFFERABLE.  ON THE CONTRARY, I THINK A YOUNG MAN
MIGHT BE VERY SAFELY RECOMMENDED TO TAKE MR. ELTON AS A MODEL.
MR. ELTON IS GOOD-HUMOURED, CHEERFUL, OBLIGING, AND GENTLE.
HE SEEMS TO ME TO BE GROWN PARTICULARLY GENTLE OF LATE.  I DO NOT
KNOW WHETHER HE HAS ANY DESIGN OF INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH EITHER
OF US, HARRIET, BY ADDITIONAL SOFTNESS, BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT HIS
MANNERS ARE SOFTER THAN THEY USED TO BE.  IF HE MEANS ANY THING,
IT MUST BE TO PLEASE YOU.  DID NOT I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID OF YOU
THE OTHER DAY?"

SHE THEN REPEATED SOME WARM PERSONAL PRAISE WHICH SHE HAD DRAWN
FROM MR. ELTON, AND NOW DID FULL JUSTICE TO; AND HARRIET BLUSHED
AND SMILED, AND SAID SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT MR. ELTON VERY AGREEABLE.

MR. ELTON WAS THE VERY PERSON FIXED ON BY EMMA FOR DRIVING
THE YOUNG FARMER OUT OF HARRIET'S HEAD.  SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE AN EXCELLENT MATCH; AND ONLY TOO PALPABLY DESIRABLE, NATURAL,
AND PROBABLE, FOR HER TO HAVE MUCH MERIT IN PLANNING IT.
SHE FEARED IT WAS WHAT EVERY BODY ELSE MUST THINK OF AND PREDICT.
IT WAS NOT LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT ANY BODY SHOULD HAVE EQUALLED
HER IN THE DATE OF THE PLAN, AS IT HAD ENTERED HER BRAIN DURING
THE VERY FIRST EVENING OF HARRIET'S COMING TO HARTFIELD.  THE LONGER
SHE CONSIDERED IT, THE GREATER WAS HER SENSE OF ITS EXPEDIENCY.
MR. ELTON'S SITUATION WAS MOST SUITABLE, QUITE THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF,
AND WITHOUT LOW CONNEXIONS; AT THE SAME TIME, NOT OF ANY FAMILY
THAT COULD FAIRLY OBJECT TO THE DOUBTFUL BIRTH OF HARRIET.  HE HAD A
COMFORTABLE HOME FOR HER, AND EMMA IMAGINED A VERY SUFFICIENT INCOME;
FOR THOUGH THE VICARAGE OF HIGHBURY WAS NOT LARGE, HE WAS KNOWN
TO HAVE SOME INDEPENDENT PROPERTY; AND SHE THOUGHT VERY HIGHLY
OF HIM AS A GOOD-HUMOURED, WELL-MEANING, RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN,
WITHOUT ANY DEFICIENCY OF USEFUL UNDERSTANDING OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD.

SHE HAD ALREADY SATISFIED HERSELF THAT HE THOUGHT HARRIET A BEAUTIFUL
GIRL, WHICH SHE TRUSTED, WITH SUCH FREQUENT MEETINGS AT HARTFIELD,
WAS FOUNDATION ENOUGH ON HIS SIDE; AND ON HARRIET'S THERE COULD BE
LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE IDEA OF BEING PREFERRED BY HIM WOULD HAVE ALL
THE USUAL WEIGHT AND EFFICACY.  AND HE WAS REALLY A VERY PLEASING
YOUNG MAN, A YOUNG MAN WHOM ANY WOMAN NOT FASTIDIOUS MIGHT LIKE.
HE WAS RECKONED VERY HANDSOME; HIS PERSON MUCH ADMIRED IN GENERAL,
THOUGH NOT BY HER, THERE BEING A WANT OF ELEGANCE OF FEATURE WHICH
SHE COULD NOT DISPENSE WITH:--BUT THE GIRL WHO COULD BE GRATIFIED
BY A ROBERT MARTIN'S RIDING ABOUT THE COUNTRY TO GET WALNUTS
FOR HER MIGHT VERY WELL BE CONQUERED BY MR. ELTON'S ADMIRATION.



CHAPTER V


"I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOUR OPINION MAY BE, MRS. WESTON," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, "OF
THIS GREAT INTIMACY BETWEEN EMMA AND HARRIET SMITH, BUT I THINK IT A BAD THING."

"A BAD THING! DO YOU REALLY THINK IT A BAD THING?--WHY SO?"

"I THINK THEY WILL NEITHER OF THEM DO THE OTHER ANY GOOD."

"YOU SURPRIZE ME! EMMA MUST DO HARRIET GOOD: AND BY SUPPLYING HER
WITH A NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST, HARRIET MAY BE SAID TO DO EMMA GOOD.
I HAVE BEEN SEEING THEIR INTIMACY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE.
HOW VERY DIFFERENTLY WE FEEL!--NOT THINK THEY WILL DO EACH OTHER ANY
GOOD! THIS WILL CERTAINLY BE THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF OUR QUARRELS
ABOUT EMMA, MR. KNIGHTLEY."

"PERHAPS YOU THINK I AM COME ON PURPOSE TO QUARREL WITH YOU,
KNOWING WESTON TO BE OUT, AND THAT YOU MUST STILL FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLE."

"MR. WESTON WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORT ME, IF HE WERE HERE,
FOR HE THINKS EXACTLY AS I DO ON THE SUBJECT.  WE WERE SPEAKING
OF IT ONLY YESTERDAY, AND AGREEING HOW FORTUNATE IT WAS FOR EMMA,
THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A GIRL IN HIGHBURY FOR HER TO ASSOCIATE WITH.
MR. KNIGHTLEY, I SHALL NOT ALLOW YOU TO BE A FAIR JUDGE IN THIS CASE.
YOU ARE SO MUCH USED TO LIVE ALONE, THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW THE VALUE
OF A COMPANION; AND, PERHAPS NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE OF THE COMFORT
A WOMAN FEELS IN THE SOCIETY OF ONE OF HER OWN SEX, AFTER BEING USED
TO IT ALL HER LIFE.  I CAN IMAGINE YOUR OBJECTION TO HARRIET SMITH.
SHE IS NOT THE SUPERIOR YOUNG WOMAN WHICH EMMA'S FRIEND OUGHT TO BE.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, AS EMMA WANTS TO SEE HER BETTER INFORMED,
IT WILL BE AN INDUCEMENT TO HER TO READ MORE HERSELF.  THEY WILL
READ TOGETHER.  SHE MEANS IT, I KNOW."

"EMMA HAS BEEN MEANING TO READ MORE EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE
YEARS OLD.  I HAVE SEEN A GREAT MANY LISTS OF HER DRAWING-UP AT
VARIOUS TIMES OF BOOKS THAT SHE MEANT TO READ REGULARLY THROUGH--AND
VERY GOOD LISTS THEY WERE--VERY WELL CHOSEN, AND VERY NEATLY
ARRANGED--SOMETIMES ALPHABETICALLY, AND SOMETIMES BY SOME OTHER RULE.
THE LIST SHE DREW UP WHEN ONLY FOURTEEN--I REMEMBER THINKING IT
DID HER JUDGMENT SO MUCH CREDIT, THAT I PRESERVED IT SOME TIME;
AND I DARE SAY SHE MAY HAVE MADE OUT A VERY GOOD LIST NOW.  BUT I
HAVE DONE WITH EXPECTING ANY COURSE OF STEADY READING FROM EMMA.
SHE WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO ANY THING REQUIRING INDUSTRY AND PATIENCE,
AND A SUBJECTION OF THE FANCY TO THE UNDERSTANDING.  WHERE MISS TAYLOR
FAILED TO STIMULATE, I MAY SAFELY AFFIRM THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL DO
NOTHING.--YOU NEVER COULD PERSUADE HER TO READ HALF SO MUCH AS YOU
WISHED.--YOU KNOW YOU COULD NOT."

"I DARE SAY," REPLIED MRS. WESTON, SMILING, "THAT I THOUGHT
SO _THEN_;--BUT SINCE WE HAVE PARTED, I CAN NEVER REMEMBER EMMA'S
OMITTING TO DO ANY THING I WISHED."

"THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS _THAT_,"--SAID
MR. KNIGHTLEY, FEELINGLY; AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE.  "BUT I,"
HE SOON ADDED, "WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES,
MUST STILL SEE, HEAR, AND REMEMBER.  EMMA IS SPOILED BY BEING THE
CLEVEREST OF HER FAMILY.  AT TEN YEARS OLD, SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF
BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH PUZZLED HER SISTER AT SEVENTEEN.
SHE WAS ALWAYS QUICK AND ASSURED: ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT.
AND EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE, EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE
AND OF YOU ALL.  IN HER MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE
WITH HER.  SHE INHERITS HER MOTHER'S TALENTS, AND MUST HAVE BEEN
UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER."

"I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY, MR. KNIGHTLEY, TO BE DEPENDENT ON
_YOUR_ RECOMMENDATION, HAD I QUITTED MR. WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY AND WANTED
ANOTHER SITUATION; I DO NOT THINK YOU WOULD HAVE SPOKEN A GOOD WORD FOR
ME TO ANY BODY.  I AM SURE YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT ME UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE I HELD."

"YES," SAID HE, SMILING.  "YOU ARE BETTER PLACED _HERE_; VERY FIT
FOR A WIFE, BUT NOT AT ALL FOR A GOVERNESS.  BUT YOU WERE PREPARING
YOURSELF TO BE AN EXCELLENT WIFE ALL THE TIME YOU WERE AT HARTFIELD.
YOU MIGHT NOT GIVE EMMA SUCH A COMPLETE EDUCATION AS YOUR POWERS WOULD
SEEM TO PROMISE; BUT YOU WERE RECEIVING A VERY GOOD EDUCATION FROM _HER_,
ON THE VERY MATERIAL MATRIMONIAL POINT OF SUBMITTING YOUR OWN WILL,
AND DOING AS YOU WERE BID; AND IF WESTON HAD ASKED ME TO RECOMMEND
HIM A WIFE, I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE NAMED MISS TAYLOR."

"THANK YOU.  THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE MERIT IN MAKING A GOOD WIFE
TO SUCH A MAN AS MR. WESTON."

"WHY, TO OWN THE TRUTH, I AM AFRAID YOU ARE RATHER THROWN AWAY,
AND THAT WITH EVERY DISPOSITION TO BEAR, THERE WILL BE NOTHING
TO BE BORNE.  WE WILL NOT DESPAIR, HOWEVER.  WESTON MAY GROW CROSS
FROM THE WANTONNESS OF COMFORT, OR HIS SON MAY PLAGUE HIM."

"I HOPE NOT _THAT_.--IT IS NOT LIKELY.  NO, MR. KNIGHTLEY, DO NOT
FORETELL VEXATION FROM THAT QUARTER."

"NOT I, INDEED.  I ONLY NAME POSSIBILITIES.  I DO NOT PRETEND TO EMMA'S
GENIUS FOR FORETELLING AND GUESSING.  I HOPE, WITH ALL MY HEART,
THE YOUNG MAN MAY BE A WESTON IN MERIT, AND A CHURCHILL IN FORTUNE.--BUT
HARRIET SMITH--I HAVE NOT HALF DONE ABOUT HARRIET SMITH.  I THINK
HER THE VERY WORST SORT OF COMPANION THAT EMMA COULD POSSIBLY HAVE.
SHE KNOWS NOTHING HERSELF, AND LOOKS UPON EMMA AS KNOWING EVERY THING.
SHE IS A FLATTERER IN ALL HER WAYS; AND SO MUCH THE WORSE,
BECAUSE UNDESIGNED.  HER IGNORANCE IS HOURLY FLATTERY.  HOW CAN
EMMA IMAGINE SHE HAS ANY THING TO LEARN HERSELF, WHILE HARRIET
IS PRESENTING SUCH A DELIGHTFUL INFERIORITY? AND AS FOR HARRIET,
I WILL VENTURE TO SAY THAT _SHE_ CANNOT GAIN BY THE ACQUAINTANCE.
HARTFIELD WILL ONLY PUT HER OUT OF CONCEIT WITH ALL THE OTHER PLACES
SHE BELONGS TO.  SHE WILL GROW JUST REFINED ENOUGH TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THOSE AMONG WHOM BIRTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE PLACED HER HOME.
I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF EMMA'S DOCTRINES GIVE ANY STRENGTH OF MIND,
OR TEND AT ALL TO MAKE A GIRL ADAPT HERSELF RATIONALLY TO THE VARIETIES
OF HER SITUATION IN LIFE.--THEY ONLY GIVE A LITTLE POLISH."

"I EITHER DEPEND MORE UPON EMMA'S GOOD SENSE THAN YOU DO, OR AM MORE
ANXIOUS FOR HER PRESENT COMFORT; FOR I CANNOT LAMENT THE ACQUAINTANCE.
HOW WELL SHE LOOKED LAST NIGHT!"

"OH! YOU WOULD RATHER TALK OF HER PERSON THAN HER MIND, WOULD YOU?
VERY WELL; I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY EMMA'S BEING PRETTY."

"PRETTY! SAY BEAUTIFUL RATHER.  CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY THING NEARER
PERFECT BEAUTY THAN EMMA ALTOGETHER--FACE AND FIGURE?"

"I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I COULD IMAGINE, BUT I CONFESS THAT I HAVE
SELDOM SEEN A FACE OR FIGURE MORE PLEASING TO ME THAN HERS.
BUT I AM A PARTIAL OLD FRIEND."

"SUCH AN EYE!--THE TRUE HAZLE EYE--AND SO BRILLIANT! REGULAR FEATURES,
OPEN COUNTENANCE, WITH A COMPLEXION! OH! WHAT A BLOOM OF FULL HEALTH,
AND SUCH A PRETTY HEIGHT AND SIZE; SUCH A FIRM AND UPRIGHT FIGURE!
THERE IS HEALTH, NOT MERELY IN HER BLOOM, BUT IN HER AIR, HER HEAD,
HER GLANCE.  ONE HEARS SOMETIMES OF A CHILD BEING `THE PICTURE
OF HEALTH;' NOW, EMMA ALWAYS GIVES ME THE IDEA OF BEING THE COMPLETE
PICTURE OF GROWN-UP HEALTH.  SHE IS LOVELINESS ITSELF.  MR. KNIGHTLEY,
IS NOT SHE?"

"I HAVE NOT A FAULT TO FIND WITH HER PERSON," HE REPLIED.
"I THINK HER ALL YOU DESCRIBE.  I LOVE TO LOOK AT HER; AND I
WILL ADD THIS PRAISE, THAT I DO NOT THINK HER PERSONALLY VAIN.
CONSIDERING HOW VERY HANDSOME SHE IS, SHE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE
OCCUPIED WITH IT; HER VANITY LIES ANOTHER WAY.  MRS. WESTON, I AM
NOT TO BE TALKED OUT OF MY DISLIKE OF HARRIET SMITH, OR MY DREAD
OF ITS DOING THEM BOTH HARM."

"AND I, MR. KNIGHTLEY, AM EQUALLY STOUT IN MY CONFIDENCE OF ITS
NOT DOING THEM ANY HARM.  WITH ALL DEAR EMMA'S LITTLE FAULTS,
SHE IS AN EXCELLENT CREATURE.  WHERE SHALL WE SEE A BETTER DAUGHTER,
OR A KINDER SISTER, OR A TRUER FRIEND? NO, NO; SHE HAS QUALITIES
WHICH MAY BE TRUSTED; SHE WILL NEVER LEAD ANY ONE REALLY WRONG;
SHE WILL MAKE NO LASTING BLUNDER; WHERE EMMA ERRS ONCE, SHE IS IN THE
RIGHT A HUNDRED TIMES."

"VERY WELL; I WILL NOT PLAGUE YOU ANY MORE.  EMMA SHALL BE AN ANGEL,
AND I WILL KEEP MY SPLEEN TO MYSELF TILL CHRISTMAS BRINGS JOHN
AND ISABELLA.  JOHN LOVES EMMA WITH A REASONABLE AND THEREFORE
NOT A BLIND AFFECTION, AND ISABELLA ALWAYS THINKS AS HE DOES;
EXCEPT WHEN HE IS NOT QUITE FRIGHTENED ENOUGH ABOUT THE CHILDREN.
I AM SURE OF HAVING THEIR OPINIONS WITH ME."

"I KNOW THAT YOU ALL LOVE HER REALLY TOO WELL TO BE UNJUST OR UNKIND;
BUT EXCUSE ME, MR. KNIGHTLEY, IF I TAKE THE LIBERTY (I CONSIDER MYSELF,
YOU KNOW, AS HAVING SOMEWHAT OF THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEECH THAT EMMA'S
MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD) THE LIBERTY OF HINTING THAT I DO NOT THINK
ANY POSSIBLE GOOD CAN ARISE FROM HARRIET SMITH'S INTIMACY BEING MADE
A MATTER OF MUCH DISCUSSION AMONG YOU.  PRAY EXCUSE ME; BUT SUPPOSING
ANY LITTLE INCONVENIENCE MAY BE APPREHENDED FROM THE INTIMACY,
IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT EMMA, ACCOUNTABLE TO NOBODY BUT HER FATHER,
WHO PERFECTLY APPROVES THE ACQUAINTANCE, SHOULD PUT AN END TO IT,
SO LONG AS IT IS A SOURCE OF PLEASURE TO HERSELF.  IT HAS BEEN SO
MANY YEARS MY PROVINCE TO GIVE ADVICE, THAT YOU CANNOT BE SURPRIZED,
MR. KNIGHTLEY, AT THIS LITTLE REMAINS OF OFFICE."

"NOT AT ALL," CRIED HE; "I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR IT.
IT IS VERY GOOD ADVICE, AND IT SHALL HAVE A BETTER FATE THAN YOUR
ADVICE HAS OFTEN FOUND; FOR IT SHALL BE ATTENDED TO."

"MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY IS EASILY ALARMED, AND MIGHT BE MADE UNHAPPY
ABOUT HER SISTER."

"BE SATISFIED," SAID HE, "I WILL NOT RAISE ANY OUTCRY.  I WILL KEEP
MY ILL-HUMOUR TO MYSELF.  I HAVE A VERY SINCERE INTEREST IN EMMA.
ISABELLA DOES NOT SEEM MORE MY SISTER; HAS NEVER EXCITED A
GREATER INTEREST; PERHAPS HARDLY SO GREAT.  THERE IS AN ANXIETY,
A CURIOSITY IN WHAT ONE FEELS FOR EMMA.  I WONDER WHAT WILL BECOME
OF HER!"

"SO DO I," SAID MRS. WESTON GENTLY, "VERY MUCH."

"SHE ALWAYS DECLARES SHE WILL NEVER MARRY, WHICH, OF COURSE,
MEANS JUST NOTHING AT ALL.  BUT I HAVE NO IDEA THAT SHE HAS YET
EVER SEEN A MAN SHE CARED FOR.  IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD THING FOR HER
TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH A PROPER OBJECT.  I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE
EMMA IN LOVE, AND IN SOME DOUBT OF A RETURN; IT WOULD DO HER GOOD.
BUT THERE IS NOBODY HEREABOUTS TO ATTACH HER; AND SHE GOES SO SELDOM
FROM HOME."

"THERE DOES, INDEED, SEEM AS LITTLE TO TEMPT HER TO BREAK
HER RESOLUTION AT PRESENT," SAID MRS. WESTON, "AS CAN WELL BE;
AND WHILE SHE IS SO HAPPY AT HARTFIELD, I CANNOT WISH HER TO BE
FORMING ANY ATTACHMENT WHICH WOULD BE CREATING SUCH DIFFICULTIES
ON POOR MR. WOODHOUSE'S ACCOUNT.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND MATRIMONY
AT PRESENT TO EMMA, THOUGH I MEAN NO SLIGHT TO THE STATE, I ASSURE YOU."

PART OF HER MEANING WAS TO CONCEAL SOME FAVOURITE THOUGHTS OF
HER OWN AND MR. WESTON'S ON THE SUBJECT, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
THERE WERE WISHES AT RANDALLS RESPECTING EMMA'S DESTINY, BUT IT
WAS NOT DESIRABLE TO HAVE THEM SUSPECTED; AND THE QUIET TRANSITION
WHICH MR. KNIGHTLEY SOON AFTERWARDS MADE TO "WHAT DOES WESTON
THINK OF THE WEATHER; SHALL WE HAVE RAIN?" CONVINCED HER THAT HE
HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY OR SURMISE ABOUT HARTFIELD.



CHAPTER VI


EMMA COULD NOT FEEL A DOUBT OF HAVING GIVEN HARRIET'S FANCY
A PROPER DIRECTION AND RAISED THE GRATITUDE OF HER YOUNG VANITY
TO A VERY GOOD PURPOSE, FOR SHE FOUND HER DECIDEDLY MORE SENSIBLE
THAN BEFORE OF MR. ELTON'S BEING A REMARKABLY HANDSOME MAN, WITH MOST
AGREEABLE MANNERS; AND AS SHE HAD NO HESITATION IN FOLLOWING UP
THE ASSURANCE OF HIS ADMIRATION BY AGREEABLE HINTS, SHE WAS SOON
PRETTY CONFIDENT OF CREATING AS MUCH LIKING ON HARRIET'S SIDE,
AS THERE COULD BE ANY OCCASION FOR.  SHE WAS QUITE CONVINCED
OF MR. ELTON'S BEING IN THE FAIREST WAY OF FALLING IN LOVE,
IF NOT IN LOVE ALREADY.  SHE HAD NO SCRUPLE WITH REGARD TO HIM.
HE TALKED OF HARRIET, AND PRAISED HER SO WARMLY, THAT SHE COULD
NOT SUPPOSE ANY THING WANTING WHICH A LITTLE TIME WOULD NOT ADD.
HIS PERCEPTION OF THE STRIKING IMPROVEMENT OF HARRIET'S MANNER,
SINCE HER INTRODUCTION AT HARTFIELD, WAS NOT ONE OF THE LEAST
AGREEABLE PROOFS OF HIS GROWING ATTACHMENT.

"YOU HAVE GIVEN MISS SMITH ALL THAT SHE REQUIRED," SAID HE;
"YOU HAVE MADE HER GRACEFUL AND EASY.  SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE
WHEN SHE CAME TO YOU, BUT, IN MY OPINION, THE ATTRACTIONS YOU HAVE
ADDED ARE INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO WHAT SHE RECEIVED FROM NATURE."

"I AM GLAD YOU THINK I HAVE BEEN USEFUL TO HER; BUT HARRIET
ONLY WANTED DRAWING OUT, AND RECEIVING A FEW, VERY FEW HINTS.
SHE HAD ALL THE NATURAL GRACE OF SWEETNESS OF TEMPER AND ARTLESSNESS
IN HERSELF.  I HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE."

"IF IT WERE ADMISSIBLE TO CONTRADICT A LADY," SAID THE GALLANT
MR. ELTON--

"I HAVE PERHAPS GIVEN HER A LITTLE MORE DECISION OF CHARACTER,
HAVE TAUGHT HER TO THINK ON POINTS WHICH HAD NOT FALLEN IN HER
WAY BEFORE."

"EXACTLY SO; THAT IS WHAT PRINCIPALLY STRIKES ME.  SO MUCH SUPERADDED
DECISION OF CHARACTER! SKILFUL HAS BEEN THE HAND!"

"GREAT HAS BEEN THE PLEASURE, I AM SURE.  I NEVER MET WITH
A DISPOSITION MORE TRULY AMIABLE."

"I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT." AND IT WAS SPOKEN WITH A SORT
OF SIGHING ANIMATION, WHICH HAD A VAST DEAL OF THE LOVER.
SHE WAS NOT LESS PLEASED ANOTHER DAY WITH THE MANNER
IN WHICH HE SECONDED A SUDDEN WISH OF HERS, TO HAVE HARRIET'S PICTURE.

"DID YOU EVER HAVE YOUR LIKENESS TAKEN, HARRIET?" SAID SHE: "DID
YOU EVER SIT FOR YOUR PICTURE?"

HARRIET WAS ON THE POINT OF LEAVING THE ROOM, AND ONLY STOPT TO SAY,
WITH A VERY INTERESTING NAIVETE,

"OH! DEAR, NO, NEVER."

NO SOONER WAS SHE OUT OF SIGHT, THAN EMMA EXCLAIMED,

"WHAT AN EXQUISITE POSSESSION A GOOD PICTURE OF HER WOULD BE! I WOULD
GIVE ANY MONEY FOR IT.  I ALMOST LONG TO ATTEMPT HER LIKENESS MYSELF.
YOU DO NOT KNOW IT I DARE SAY, BUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO I HAD
A GREAT PASSION FOR TAKING LIKENESSES, AND ATTEMPTED SEVERAL OF
MY FRIENDS, AND WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE A TOLERABLE EYE IN GENERAL.
BUT FROM ONE CAUSE OR ANOTHER, I GAVE IT UP IN DISGUST.
BUT REALLY, I COULD ALMOST VENTURE, IF HARRIET WOULD SIT TO ME.
IT WOULD BE SUCH A DELIGHT TO HAVE HER PICTURE!"

"LET ME ENTREAT YOU," CRIED MR. ELTON; "IT WOULD INDEED BE A DELIGHT!
LET ME ENTREAT YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, TO EXERCISE SO CHARMING A
TALENT IN FAVOUR OF YOUR FRIEND.  I KNOW WHAT YOUR DRAWINGS ARE.
HOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE ME IGNORANT? IS NOT THIS ROOM RICH IN
SPECIMENS OF YOUR LANDSCAPES AND FLOWERS; AND HAS NOT MRS. WESTON
SOME INIMITABLE FIGURE-PIECES IN HER DRAWING-ROOM, AT RANDALLS?"

YES, GOOD MAN!--THOUGHT EMMA--BUT WHAT HAS ALL THAT TO DO WITH TAKING
LIKENESSES? YOU KNOW NOTHING OF DRAWING.  DON'T PRETEND TO BE
IN RAPTURES ABOUT MINE.  KEEP YOUR RAPTURES FOR HARRIET'S FACE.
"WELL, IF YOU GIVE ME SUCH KIND ENCOURAGEMENT, MR. ELTON, I BELIEVE
I SHALL TRY WHAT I CAN DO.  HARRIET'S FEATURES ARE VERY DELICATE,
WHICH MAKES A LIKENESS DIFFICULT; AND YET THERE IS A PECULIARITY
IN THE SHAPE OF THE EYE AND THE LINES ABOUT THE MOUTH WHICH ONE OUGHT
TO CATCH."

"EXACTLY SO--THE SHAPE OF THE EYE AND THE LINES ABOUT THE MOUTH--I
HAVE NOT A DOUBT OF YOUR SUCCESS.  PRAY, PRAY ATTEMPT IT.
AS YOU WILL DO IT, IT WILL INDEED, TO USE YOUR OWN WORDS,
BE AN EXQUISITE POSSESSION."

"BUT I AM AFRAID, MR. ELTON, HARRIET WILL NOT LIKE TO SIT.
SHE THINKS SO LITTLE OF HER OWN BEAUTY.  DID NOT YOU OBSERVE HER
MANNER OF ANSWERING ME? HOW COMPLETELY IT MEANT, `WHY SHOULD MY
PICTURE BE DRAWN?'"

"OH! YES, I OBSERVED IT, I ASSURE YOU.  IT WAS NOT LOST ON ME.
BUT STILL I CANNOT IMAGINE SHE WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED."

HARRIET WAS SOON BACK AGAIN, AND THE PROPOSAL ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MADE;
AND SHE HAD NO SCRUPLES WHICH COULD STAND MANY MINUTES AGAINST THE EARNEST
PRESSING OF BOTH THE OTHERS.  EMMA WISHED TO GO TO WORK DIRECTLY,
AND THEREFORE PRODUCED THE PORTFOLIO CONTAINING HER VARIOUS ATTEMPTS
AT PORTRAITS, FOR NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER BEEN FINISHED, THAT THEY
MIGHT DECIDE TOGETHER ON THE BEST SIZE FOR HARRIET.  HER MANY
BEGINNINGS WERE DISPLAYED.  MINIATURES, HALF-LENGTHS, WHOLE-LENGTHS,
PENCIL, CRAYON, AND WATER-COLOURS HAD BEEN ALL TRIED IN TURN.
SHE HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO DO EVERY THING, AND HAD MADE MORE PROGRESS
BOTH IN DRAWING AND MUSIC THAN MANY MIGHT HAVE DONE WITH SO LITTLE
LABOUR AS SHE WOULD EVER SUBMIT TO.  SHE PLAYED AND SANG;--AND DREW
IN ALMOST EVERY STYLE; BUT STEADINESS HAD ALWAYS BEEN WANTING;
AND IN NOTHING HAD SHE APPROACHED THE DEGREE OF EXCELLENCE WHICH SHE
WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO COMMAND, AND OUGHT NOT TO HAVE FAILED OF.
SHE WAS NOT MUCH DECEIVED AS TO HER OWN SKILL EITHER AS AN ARTIST
OR A MUSICIAN, BUT SHE WAS NOT UNWILLING TO HAVE OTHERS DECEIVED,
OR SORRY TO KNOW HER REPUTATION FOR ACCOMPLISHMENT OFTEN HIGHER
THAN IT DESERVED.

THERE WAS MERIT IN EVERY DRAWING--IN THE LEAST FINISHED, PERHAPS THE MOST;
HER STYLE WAS SPIRITED; BUT HAD THERE BEEN MUCH LESS, OR HAD THERE
BEEN TEN TIMES MORE, THE DELIGHT AND ADMIRATION OF HER TWO COMPANIONS
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME.  THEY WERE BOTH IN ECSTASIES.  A LIKENESS
PLEASES EVERY BODY; AND MISS WOODHOUSE'S PERFORMANCES MUST BE CAPITAL.

"NO GREAT VARIETY OF FACES FOR YOU," SAID EMMA.  "I HAD ONLY MY
OWN FAMILY TO STUDY FROM.  THERE IS MY FATHER--ANOTHER OF MY
FATHER--BUT THE IDEA OF SITTING FOR HIS PICTURE MADE HIM SO NERVOUS,
THAT I COULD ONLY TAKE HIM BY STEALTH; NEITHER OF THEM VERY
LIKE THEREFORE.  MRS. WESTON AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN, YOU SEE.
DEAR MRS. WESTON! ALWAYS MY KINDEST FRIEND ON EVERY OCCASION.
SHE WOULD SIT WHENEVER I ASKED HER.  THERE IS MY SISTER; AND REALLY
QUITE HER OWN LITTLE ELEGANT FIGURE!--AND THE FACE NOT UNLIKE.
I SHOULD HAVE MADE A GOOD LIKENESS OF HER, IF SHE WOULD HAVE
SAT LONGER, BUT SHE WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO HAVE ME DRAW HER FOUR
CHILDREN THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE QUIET.  THEN, HERE COME ALL MY
ATTEMPTS AT THREE OF THOSE FOUR CHILDREN;--THERE THEY ARE,
HENRY AND JOHN AND BELLA, FROM ONE END OF THE SHEET TO THE OTHER,
AND ANY ONE OF THEM MIGHT DO FOR ANY ONE OF THE REST.  SHE WAS SO
EAGER TO HAVE THEM DRAWN THAT I COULD NOT REFUSE; BUT THERE IS NO
MAKING CHILDREN OF THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD STAND STILL YOU KNOW;
NOR CAN IT BE VERY EASY TO TAKE ANY LIKENESS OF THEM, BEYOND THE
AIR AND COMPLEXION, UNLESS THEY ARE COARSER FEATURED THAN ANY
OF MAMA'S CHILDREN EVER WERE.  HERE IS MY SKETCH OF THE FOURTH,
WHO WAS A BABY.  I TOOK HIM AS HE WAS SLEEPING ON THE SOFA, AND IT
IS AS STRONG A LIKENESS OF HIS COCKADE AS YOU WOULD WISH TO SEE.
HE HAD NESTLED DOWN HIS HEAD MOST CONVENIENTLY.  THAT'S VERY LIKE.
I AM RATHER PROUD OF LITTLE GEORGE.  THE CORNER OF THE SOFA IS VERY GOOD.
THEN HERE IS MY LAST,"--UNCLOSING A PRETTY SKETCH OF A GENTLEMAN
IN SMALL SIZE, WHOLE-LENGTH--"MY LAST AND MY BEST--MY BROTHER,
MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY.--THIS DID NOT WANT MUCH OF BEING FINISHED, WHEN I
PUT IT AWAY IN A PET, AND VOWED I WOULD NEVER TAKE ANOTHER LIKENESS.
I COULD NOT HELP BEING PROVOKED; FOR AFTER ALL MY PAINS, AND WHEN I
HAD REALLY MADE A VERY GOOD LIKENESS OF IT--(MRS. WESTON AND I
WERE QUITE AGREED IN THINKING IT _VERY_ LIKE)--ONLY TOO HANDSOME--TOO
FLATTERING--BUT THAT WAS A FAULT ON THE RIGHT SIDE--AFTER
ALL THIS, CAME POOR DEAR ISABELLA'S COLD APPROBATION OF--"YES,
IT WAS A LITTLE LIKE--BUT TO BE SURE IT DID NOT DO HIM JUSTICE."
WE HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE IN PERSUADING HIM TO SIT AT ALL.
IT WAS MADE A GREAT FAVOUR OF; AND ALTOGETHER IT WAS MORE THAN I
COULD BEAR; AND SO I NEVER WOULD FINISH IT, TO HAVE IT APOLOGISED
OVER AS AN UNFAVOURABLE LIKENESS, TO EVERY MORNING VISITOR IN
BRUNSWICK SQUARE;--AND, AS I SAID, I DID THEN FORSWEAR EVER DRAWING
ANY BODY AGAIN.  BUT FOR HARRIET'S SAKE, OR RATHER FOR MY OWN,
AND AS THERE ARE NO HUSBANDS AND WIVES IN THE CASE _AT_ _PRESENT_,
I WILL BREAK MY RESOLUTION NOW."

MR. ELTON SEEMED VERY PROPERLY STRUCK AND DELIGHTED BY THE IDEA,
AND WAS REPEATING, "NO HUSBANDS AND WIVES IN THE CASE AT PRESENT
INDEED, AS YOU OBSERVE.  EXACTLY SO.  NO HUSBANDS AND WIVES,"
WITH SO INTERESTING A CONSCIOUSNESS, THAT EMMA BEGAN TO CONSIDER
WHETHER SHE HAD NOT BETTER LEAVE THEM TOGETHER AT ONCE.  BUT AS SHE
WANTED TO BE DRAWING, THE DECLARATION MUST WAIT A LITTLE LONGER.

SHE HAD SOON FIXED ON THE SIZE AND SORT OF PORTRAIT.
IT WAS TO BE A WHOLE-LENGTH IN WATER-COLOURS, LIKE MR. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY'S, AND WAS DESTINED, IF SHE COULD PLEASE HERSELF,
TO HOLD A VERY HONOURABLE STATION OVER THE MANTELPIECE.

THE SITTING BEGAN; AND HARRIET, SMILING AND BLUSHING, AND AFRAID
OF NOT KEEPING HER ATTITUDE AND COUNTENANCE, PRESENTED A VERY SWEET
MIXTURE OF YOUTHFUL EXPRESSION TO THE STEADY EYES OF THE ARTIST.
BUT THERE WAS NO DOING ANY THING, WITH MR. ELTON FIDGETING BEHIND
HER AND WATCHING EVERY TOUCH.  SHE GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR STATIONING
HIMSELF WHERE HE MIGHT GAZE AND GAZE AGAIN WITHOUT OFFENCE;
BUT WAS REALLY OBLIGED TO PUT AN END TO IT, AND REQUEST HIM TO
PLACE HIMSELF ELSEWHERE.  IT THEN OCCURRED TO HER TO EMPLOY HIM
IN READING.

"IF HE WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO READ TO THEM, IT WOULD BE A KINDNESS
INDEED! IT WOULD AMUSE AWAY THE DIFFICULTIES OF HER PART, AND LESSEN
THE IRKSOMENESS OF MISS SMITH'S."

MR. ELTON WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY.  HARRIET LISTENED, AND EMMA DREW
IN PEACE.  SHE MUST ALLOW HIM TO BE STILL FREQUENTLY COMING TO LOOK;
ANY THING LESS WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN TOO LITTLE IN A LOVER;
AND HE WAS READY AT THE SMALLEST INTERMISSION OF THE PENCIL,
TO JUMP UP AND SEE THE PROGRESS, AND BE CHARMED.--THERE WAS NO
BEING DISPLEASED WITH SUCH AN ENCOURAGER, FOR HIS ADMIRATION
MADE HIM DISCERN A LIKENESS ALMOST BEFORE IT WAS POSSIBLE.
SHE COULD NOT RESPECT HIS EYE, BUT HIS LOVE AND HIS COMPLAISANCE
WERE UNEXCEPTIONABLE.

THE SITTING WAS ALTOGETHER VERY SATISFACTORY; SHE WAS QUITE
ENOUGH PLEASED WITH THE FIRST DAY'S SKETCH TO WISH TO GO ON.
THERE WAS NO WANT OF LIKENESS, SHE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE IN THE ATTITUDE,
AND AS SHE MEANT TO THROW IN A LITTLE IMPROVEMENT TO THE FIGURE,
TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE HEIGHT, AND CONSIDERABLY MORE ELEGANCE, SHE HAD
GREAT CONFIDENCE OF ITS BEING IN EVERY WAY A PRETTY DRAWING AT LAST,
AND OF ITS FILLING ITS DESTINED PLACE WITH CREDIT TO THEM BOTH--A
STANDING MEMORIAL OF THE BEAUTY OF ONE, THE SKILL OF THE OTHER,
AND THE FRIENDSHIP OF BOTH; WITH AS MANY OTHER AGREEABLE ASSOCIATIONS
AS MR. ELTON'S VERY PROMISING ATTACHMENT WAS LIKELY TO ADD.

HARRIET WAS TO SIT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY; AND MR. ELTON, JUST AS HE OUGHT,
ENTREATED FOR THE PERMISSION OF ATTENDING AND READING TO THEM AGAIN.

"BY ALL MEANS.  WE SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO CONSIDER YOU AS ONE
OF THE PARTY."

THE SAME CIVILITIES AND COURTESIES, THE SAME SUCCESS AND SATISFACTION,
TOOK PLACE ON THE MORROW, AND ACCOMPANIED THE WHOLE PROGRESS
OF THE PICTURE, WHICH WAS RAPID AND HAPPY.  EVERY BODY WHO SAW IT
WAS PLEASED, BUT MR. ELTON WAS IN CONTINUAL RAPTURES, AND DEFENDED
IT THROUGH EVERY CRITICISM.

"MISS WOODHOUSE HAS GIVEN HER FRIEND THE ONLY BEAUTY SHE
WANTED,"--OBSERVED MRS. WESTON TO HIM--NOT IN THE LEAST SUSPECTING
THAT SHE WAS ADDRESSING A LOVER.--"THE EXPRESSION OF THE EYE IS
MOST CORRECT, BUT MISS SMITH HAS NOT THOSE EYEBROWS AND EYELASHES.
IT IS THE FAULT OF HER FACE THAT SHE HAS THEM NOT."

"DO YOU THINK SO?" REPLIED HE.  "I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU.
IT APPEARS TO ME A MOST PERFECT RESEMBLANCE IN EVERY FEATURE.
I NEVER SAW SUCH A LIKENESS IN MY LIFE.  WE MUST ALLOW FOR THE EFFECT
OF SHADE, YOU KNOW."

"YOU HAVE MADE HER TOO TALL, EMMA," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY.

EMMA KNEW THAT SHE HAD, BUT WOULD NOT OWN IT; AND MR. ELTON WARMLY ADDED,

"OH NO! CERTAINLY NOT TOO TALL; NOT IN THE LEAST TOO TALL.  CONSIDER,
SHE IS SITTING DOWN--WHICH NATURALLY PRESENTS A DIFFERENT--WHICH
IN SHORT GIVES EXACTLY THE IDEA--AND THE PROPORTIONS MUST
BE PRESERVED, YOU KNOW.  PROPORTIONS, FORE-SHORTENING.--OH NO! IT
GIVES ONE EXACTLY THE IDEA OF SUCH A HEIGHT AS MISS SMITH'S. EXACTLY SO INDEED!"

"IT IS VERY PRETTY," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE.  "SO PRETTILY DONE! JUST
AS YOUR DRAWINGS ALWAYS ARE, MY DEAR.  I DO NOT KNOW ANY BODY WHO DRAWS
SO WELL AS YOU DO.  THE ONLY THING I DO NOT THOROUGHLY LIKE IS,
THAT SHE SEEMS TO BE SITTING OUT OF DOORS, WITH ONLY A LITTLE SHAWL
OVER HER SHOULDERS--AND IT MAKES ONE THINK SHE MUST CATCH COLD."

"BUT, MY DEAR PAPA, IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SUMMER; A WARM DAY IN SUMMER.
LOOK AT THE TREE."

"BUT IT IS NEVER SAFE TO SIT OUT OF DOORS, MY DEAR."

"YOU, SIR, MAY SAY ANY THING," CRIED MR. ELTON, "BUT I MUST CONFESS
THAT I REGARD IT AS A MOST HAPPY THOUGHT, THE PLACING OF MISS
SMITH OUT OF DOORS; AND THE TREE IS TOUCHED WITH SUCH INIMITABLE
SPIRIT! ANY OTHER SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS IN CHARACTER.
THE NAIVETE OF MISS SMITH'S MANNERS--AND ALTOGETHER--OH, IT IS
MOST ADMIRABLE! I CANNOT KEEP MY EYES FROM IT.  I NEVER SAW SUCH
A LIKENESS."

THE NEXT THING WANTED WAS TO GET THE PICTURE FRAMED; AND HERE WERE A
FEW DIFFICULTIES.  IT MUST BE DONE DIRECTLY; IT MUST BE DONE IN LONDON;
THE ORDER MUST GO THROUGH THE HANDS OF SOME INTELLIGENT PERSON WHOSE TASTE
COULD BE DEPENDED ON; AND ISABELLA, THE USUAL DOER OF ALL COMMISSIONS,
MUST NOT BE APPLIED TO, BECAUSE IT WAS DECEMBER, AND MR. WOODHOUSE
COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA OF HER STIRRING OUT OF HER HOUSE IN THE FOGS
OF DECEMBER.  BUT NO SOONER WAS THE DISTRESS KNOWN TO MR. ELTON,
THAN IT WAS REMOVED.  HIS GALLANTRY WAS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT.
"MIGHT HE BE TRUSTED WITH THE COMMISSION, WHAT INFINITE PLEASURE
SHOULD HE HAVE IN EXECUTING IT! HE COULD RIDE TO LONDON AT ANY TIME.
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW MUCH HE SHOULD BE GRATIFIED BY BEING
EMPLOYED ON SUCH AN ERRAND."

"HE WAS TOO GOOD!--SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHT!--SHE WOULD
NOT GIVE HIM SUCH A TROUBLESOME OFFICE FOR THE WORLD,"--BROUGHT
ON THE DESIRED REPETITION OF ENTREATIES AND ASSURANCES,--AND
A VERY FEW MINUTES SETTLED THE BUSINESS.

MR. ELTON WAS TO TAKE THE DRAWING TO LONDON, CHUSE THE FRAME,
AND GIVE THE DIRECTIONS; AND EMMA THOUGHT SHE COULD SO PACK IT
AS TO ENSURE ITS SAFETY WITHOUT MUCH INCOMMODING HIM, WHILE HE
SEEMED MOSTLY FEARFUL OF NOT BEING INCOMMODED ENOUGH.

"WHAT A PRECIOUS DEPOSIT!" SAID HE WITH A TENDER SIGH, AS HE
RECEIVED IT.

"THIS MAN IS ALMOST TOO GALLANT TO BE IN LOVE," THOUGHT EMMA.
"I SHOULD SAY SO, BUT THAT I SUPPOSE THERE MAY BE A HUNDRED DIFFERENT
WAYS OF BEING IN LOVE.  HE IS AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN, AND WILL SUIT
HARRIET EXACTLY; IT WILL BE AN `EXACTLY SO,' AS HE SAYS HIMSELF;
BUT HE DOES SIGH AND LANGUISH, AND STUDY FOR COMPLIMENTS RATHER MORE
THAN I COULD ENDURE AS A PRINCIPAL.  I COME IN FOR A PRETTY GOOD
SHARE AS A SECOND.  BUT IT IS HIS GRATITUDE ON HARRIET'S ACCOUNT."



CHAPTER VII


THE VERY DAY OF MR. ELTON'S GOING TO LONDON PRODUCED A FRESH OCCASION
FOR EMMA'S SERVICES TOWARDS HER FRIEND.  HARRIET HAD BEEN AT HARTFIELD,
AS USUAL, SOON AFTER BREAKFAST; AND, AFTER A TIME, HAD GONE HOME
TO RETURN AGAIN TO DINNER: SHE RETURNED, AND SOONER THAN HAD BEEN
TALKED OF, AND WITH AN AGITATED, HURRIED LOOK, ANNOUNCING SOMETHING
EXTRAORDINARY TO HAVE HAPPENED WHICH SHE WAS LONGING TO TELL.
HALF A MINUTE BROUGHT IT ALL OUT.  SHE HAD HEARD, AS SOON AS SHE GOT
BACK TO MRS. GODDARD'S, THAT MR. MARTIN HAD BEEN THERE AN HOUR BEFORE,
AND FINDING SHE WAS NOT AT HOME, NOR PARTICULARLY EXPECTED, HAD LEFT
A LITTLE PARCEL FOR HER FROM ONE OF HIS SISTERS, AND GONE AWAY;
AND ON OPENING THIS PARCEL, SHE HAD ACTUALLY FOUND, BESIDES THE TWO
SONGS WHICH SHE HAD LENT ELIZABETH TO COPY, A LETTER TO HERSELF;
AND THIS LETTER WAS FROM HIM, FROM MR. MARTIN, AND CONTAINED A DIRECT
PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE.  "WHO COULD HAVE THOUGHT IT? SHE WAS SO SURPRIZED
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO.  YES, QUITE A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE;
AND A VERY GOOD LETTER, AT LEAST SHE THOUGHT SO.  AND HE WROTE
AS IF HE REALLY LOVED HER VERY MUCH--BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW--AND SO,
SHE WAS COME AS FAST AS SHE COULD TO ASK MISS WOODHOUSE WHAT SHE
SHOULD DO.--" EMMA WAS HALF-ASHAMED OF HER FRIEND FOR SEEMING SO
PLEASED AND SO DOUBTFUL.

"UPON MY WORD," SHE CRIED, "THE YOUNG MAN IS DETERMINED NOT TO LOSE
ANY THING FOR WANT OF ASKING.  HE WILL CONNECT HIMSELF WELL IF HE CAN."

"WILL YOU READ THE LETTER?" CRIED HARRIET.  "PRAY DO.  I'D RATHER
YOU WOULD."

EMMA WAS NOT SORRY TO BE PRESSED.  SHE READ, AND WAS SURPRIZED.
THE STYLE OF THE LETTER WAS MUCH ABOVE HER EXPECTATION.
THERE WERE NOT MERELY NO GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, BUT AS A COMPOSITION IT
WOULD NOT HAVE DISGRACED A GENTLEMAN; THE LANGUAGE, THOUGH PLAIN,
WAS STRONG AND UNAFFECTED, AND THE SENTIMENTS IT CONVEYED VERY MUCH
TO THE CREDIT OF THE WRITER.  IT WAS SHORT, BUT EXPRESSED GOOD SENSE,
WARM ATTACHMENT, LIBERALITY, PROPRIETY, EVEN DELICACY OF FEELING.
SHE PAUSED OVER IT, WHILE HARRIET STOOD ANXIOUSLY WATCHING FOR
HER OPINION, WITH A "WELL, WELL," AND WAS AT LAST FORCED TO ADD,
"IS IT A GOOD LETTER? OR IS IT TOO SHORT?"

"YES, INDEED, A VERY GOOD LETTER," REPLIED EMMA RATHER SLOWLY--"SO
GOOD A LETTER, HARRIET, THAT EVERY THING CONSIDERED, I THINK ONE OF
HIS SISTERS MUST HAVE HELPED HIM.  I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE THE YOUNG
MAN WHOM I SAW TALKING WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY COULD EXPRESS HIMSELF
SO WELL, IF LEFT QUITE TO HIS OWN POWERS, AND YET IT IS NOT THE
STYLE OF A WOMAN; NO, CERTAINLY, IT IS TOO STRONG AND CONCISE;
NOT DIFFUSE ENOUGH FOR A WOMAN.  NO DOUBT HE IS A SENSIBLE MAN,
AND I SUPPOSE MAY HAVE A NATURAL TALENT FOR--THINKS STRONGLY AND
CLEARLY--AND WHEN HE TAKES A PEN IN HAND, HIS THOUGHTS NATURALLY FIND
PROPER WORDS.  IT IS SO WITH SOME MEN.  YES, I UNDERSTAND THE SORT
OF MIND.  VIGOROUS, DECIDED, WITH SENTIMENTS TO A CERTAIN POINT,
NOT COARSE.  A BETTER WRITTEN LETTER, HARRIET (RETURNING IT,)
THAN I HAD EXPECTED."

"WELL," SAID THE STILL WAITING HARRIET;--"WELL--AND--AND WHAT
SHALL I DO?"

"WHAT SHALL YOU DO! IN WHAT RESPECT? DO YOU MEAN WITH REGARD
TO THIS LETTER?"

"YES."

"BUT WHAT ARE YOU IN DOUBT OF? YOU MUST ANSWER IT OF COURSE--AND SPEEDILY."

"YES. BUT WHAT SHALL I SAY? DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, DO ADVISE ME."

"OH NO, NO! THE LETTER HAD MUCH BETTER BE ALL YOUR OWN.  YOU WILL
EXPRESS YOURSELF VERY PROPERLY, I AM SURE.  THERE IS NO DANGER OF YOUR
NOT BEING INTELLIGIBLE, WHICH IS THE FIRST THING.  YOUR MEANING MUST
BE UNEQUIVOCAL; NO DOUBTS OR DEMURS: AND SUCH EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE
AND CONCERN FOR THE PAIN YOU ARE INFLICTING AS PROPRIETY REQUIRES,
WILL PRESENT THEMSELVES UNBIDDEN TO _YOUR_ MIND, I AM PERSUADED.
YOU NEED NOT BE PROMPTED TO WRITE WITH THE APPEARANCE OF SORROW
FOR HIS DISAPPOINTMENT."

"YOU THINK I OUGHT TO REFUSE HIM THEN," SAID HARRIET, LOOKING DOWN.

"OUGHT TO REFUSE HIM! MY DEAR HARRIET, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ARE YOU
IN ANY DOUBT AS TO THAT? I THOUGHT--BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON, PERHAPS I
HAVE BEEN UNDER A MISTAKE.  I CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTANDING
YOU, IF YOU FEEL IN DOUBT AS TO THE _PURPORT_ OF YOUR ANSWER.
I HAD IMAGINED YOU WERE CONSULTING ME ONLY AS TO THE WORDING OF IT."

HARRIET WAS SILENT.  WITH A LITTLE RESERVE OF MANNER, EMMA CONTINUED:

"YOU MEAN TO RETURN A FAVOURABLE ANSWER, I COLLECT."

"NO, I DO NOT; THAT IS, I DO NOT MEAN--WHAT SHALL I DO? WHAT WOULD
YOU ADVISE ME TO DO? PRAY, DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, TELL ME WHAT I
OUGHT TO DO."

"I SHALL NOT GIVE YOU ANY ADVICE, HARRIET.  I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO
DO WITH IT.  THIS IS A POINT WHICH YOU MUST SETTLE WITH YOUR FEELINGS."

"I HAD NO NOTION THAT HE LIKED ME SO VERY MUCH," SAID HARRIET,
CONTEMPLATING THE LETTER.  FOR A LITTLE WHILE EMMA PERSEVERED
IN HER SILENCE; BUT BEGINNING TO APPREHEND THE BEWITCHING FLATTERY
OF THAT LETTER MIGHT BE TOO POWERFUL, SHE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SAY,

"I LAY IT DOWN AS A GENERAL RULE, HARRIET, THAT IF A WOMAN _DOUBTS_
AS TO WHETHER SHE SHOULD ACCEPT A MAN OR NOT, SHE CERTAINLY OUGHT
TO REFUSE HIM.  IF SHE CAN HESITATE AS TO `YES,' SHE OUGHT TO SAY
`NO' DIRECTLY.  IT IS NOT A STATE TO BE SAFELY ENTERED INTO
WITH DOUBTFUL FEELINGS, WITH HALF A HEART.  I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY
AS A FRIEND, AND OLDER THAN YOURSELF, TO SAY THUS MUCH TO YOU.
BUT DO NOT IMAGINE THAT I WANT TO INFLUENCE YOU."

"OH! NO, I AM SURE YOU ARE A GREAT DEAL TOO KIND TO--BUT IF YOU
WOULD JUST ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BEST DO--NO, NO, I DO NOT MEAN
THAT--AS YOU SAY, ONE'S MIND OUGHT TO BE QUITE MADE UP--ONE SHOULD
NOT BE HESITATING--IT IS A VERY SERIOUS THING.--IT WILL BE SAFER
TO SAY `NO,' PERHAPS.--DO YOU THINK I HAD BETTER SAY `NO?'"

"NOT FOR THE WORLD," SAID EMMA, SMILING GRACIOUSLY, "WOULD I ADVISE
YOU EITHER WAY.  YOU MUST BE THE BEST JUDGE OF YOUR OWN HAPPINESS.
IF YOU PREFER MR. MARTIN TO EVERY OTHER PERSON; IF YOU THINK HIM
THE MOST AGREEABLE MAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN IN COMPANY WITH, WHY SHOULD
YOU HESITATE? YOU BLUSH, HARRIET.--DOES ANY BODY ELSE OCCUR TO YOU
AT THIS MOMENT UNDER SUCH A DEFINITION? HARRIET, HARRIET, DO NOT
DECEIVE YOURSELF; DO NOT BE RUN AWAY WITH BY GRATITUDE AND COMPASSION.
AT THIS MOMENT WHOM ARE YOU THINKING OF?"

THE SYMPTOMS WERE FAVOURABLE.--INSTEAD OF ANSWERING, HARRIET TURNED
AWAY CONFUSED, AND STOOD THOUGHTFULLY BY THE FIRE; AND THOUGH
THE LETTER WAS STILL IN HER HAND, IT WAS NOW MECHANICALLY TWISTED
ABOUT WITHOUT REGARD.  EMMA WAITED THE RESULT WITH IMPATIENCE,
BUT NOT WITHOUT STRONG HOPES.  AT LAST, WITH SOME HESITATION,
HARRIET SAID--

"MISS WOODHOUSE, AS YOU WILL NOT GIVE ME YOUR OPINION, I MUST
DO AS WELL AS I CAN BY MYSELF; AND I HAVE NOW QUITE DETERMINED,
AND REALLY ALMOST MADE UP MY MIND--TO REFUSE MR. MARTIN.  DO YOU
THINK I AM RIGHT?"

"PERFECTLY, PERFECTLY RIGHT, MY DEAREST HARRIET; YOU ARE DOING JUST
WHAT YOU OUGHT.  WHILE YOU WERE AT ALL IN SUSPENSE I KEPT MY FEELINGS
TO MYSELF, BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE SO COMPLETELY DECIDED I HAVE NO
HESITATION IN APPROVING.  DEAR HARRIET, I GIVE MYSELF JOY OF THIS.
IT WOULD HAVE GRIEVED ME TO LOSE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, WHICH MUST HAVE
BEEN THE CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR MARRYING MR. MARTIN.  WHILE YOU WERE IN
THE SMALLEST DEGREE WAVERING, I SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I WOULD
NOT INFLUENCE; BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LOSS OF A FRIEND TO ME.
I COULD NOT HAVE VISITED MRS. ROBERT MARTIN, OF ABBEY-MILL FARM.
NOW I AM SECURE OF YOU FOR EVER."

HARRIET HAD NOT SURMISED HER OWN DANGER, BUT THE IDEA OF IT STRUCK
HER FORCIBLY.

"YOU COULD NOT HAVE VISITED ME!" SHE CRIED, LOOKING AGHAST.
"NO, TO BE SURE YOU COULD NOT; BUT I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO DREADFUL!--WHAT AN ESCAPE!--DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE,
I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THE PLEASURE AND HONOUR OF BEING INTIMATE WITH YOU
FOR ANY THING IN THE WORLD."

"INDEED, HARRIET, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SEVERE PANG TO LOSE YOU;
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN.  YOU WOULD HAVE THROWN YOURSELF OUT OF ALL
GOOD SOCIETY.  I MUST HAVE GIVEN YOU UP."

"DEAR ME!--HOW SHOULD I EVER HAVE BORNE IT! IT WOULD HAVE KILLED
ME NEVER TO COME TO HARTFIELD ANY MORE!"

"DEAR AFFECTIONATE CREATURE!--_YOU_ BANISHED TO ABBEY-MILL FARM!--_YOU_
CONFINED TO THE SOCIETY OF THE ILLITERATE AND VULGAR ALL YOUR LIFE!
I WONDER HOW THE YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE THE ASSURANCE TO ASK IT.
HE MUST HAVE A PRETTY GOOD OPINION OF HIMSELF."

"I DO NOT THINK HE IS CONCEITED EITHER, IN GENERAL," SAID HARRIET,
HER CONSCIENCE OPPOSING SUCH CENSURE; "AT LEAST, HE IS VERY GOOD NATURED,
AND I SHALL ALWAYS FEEL MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM, AND HAVE A GREAT REGARD
FOR--BUT THAT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING FROM--AND YOU KNOW,
THOUGH HE MAY LIKE ME, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT I SHOULD--AND
CERTAINLY I MUST CONFESS THAT SINCE MY VISITING HERE I HAVE SEEN
PEOPLE--AND IF ONE COMES TO COMPARE THEM, PERSON AND MANNERS,
THERE IS NO COMPARISON AT ALL, _ONE_ IS SO VERY HANDSOME AND AGREEABLE.
HOWEVER, I DO REALLY THINK MR. MARTIN A VERY AMIABLE YOUNG MAN,
AND HAVE A GREAT OPINION OF HIM; AND HIS BEING SO MUCH ATTACHED
TO ME--AND HIS WRITING SUCH A LETTER--BUT AS TO LEAVING YOU,
IT IS WHAT I WOULD NOT DO UPON ANY CONSIDERATION."

"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, MY OWN SWEET LITTLE FRIEND.  WE WILL NOT
BE PARTED.  A WOMAN IS NOT TO MARRY A MAN MERELY BECAUSE SHE IS ASKED,
OR BECAUSE HE IS ATTACHED TO HER, AND CAN WRITE A TOLERABLE LETTER."

"OH NO;--AND IT IS BUT A SHORT LETTER TOO."

EMMA FELT THE BAD TASTE OF HER FRIEND, BUT LET IT PASS WITH A
"VERY TRUE; AND IT WOULD BE A SMALL CONSOLATION TO HER, FOR THE
CLOWNISH MANNER WHICH MIGHT BE OFFENDING HER EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY,
TO KNOW THAT HER HUSBAND COULD WRITE A GOOD LETTER."

"OH! YES, VERY.  NOBODY CARES FOR A LETTER; THE THING IS, TO BE ALWAYS
HAPPY WITH PLEASANT COMPANIONS.  I AM QUITE DETERMINED TO REFUSE HIM.
BUT HOW SHALL I DO? WHAT SHALL I SAY?"

EMMA ASSURED HER THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN THE ANSWER,
AND ADVISED ITS BEING WRITTEN DIRECTLY, WHICH WAS AGREED TO,
IN THE HOPE OF HER ASSISTANCE; AND THOUGH EMMA CONTINUED TO PROTEST
AGAINST ANY ASSISTANCE BEING WANTED, IT WAS IN FACT GIVEN IN THE
FORMATION OF EVERY SENTENCE.  THE LOOKING OVER HIS LETTER AGAIN,
IN REPLYING TO IT, HAD SUCH A SOFTENING TENDENCY, THAT IT WAS
PARTICULARLY NECESSARY TO BRACE HER UP WITH A FEW DECISIVE EXPRESSIONS;
AND SHE WAS SO VERY MUCH CONCERNED AT THE IDEA OF MAKING HIM UNHAPPY,
AND THOUGHT SO MUCH OF WHAT HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS WOULD THINK AND SAY,
AND WAS SO ANXIOUS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT FANCY HER UNGRATEFUL,
THAT EMMA BELIEVED IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD COME IN HER WAY AT THAT MOMENT,
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AFTER ALL.

THIS LETTER, HOWEVER, WAS WRITTEN, AND SEALED, AND SENT.
THE BUSINESS WAS FINISHED, AND HARRIET SAFE.  SHE WAS RATHER LOW
ALL THE EVENING, BUT EMMA COULD ALLOW FOR HER AMIABLE REGRETS,
AND SOMETIMES RELIEVED THEM BY SPEAKING OF HER OWN AFFECTION,
SOMETIMES BY BRINGING FORWARD THE IDEA OF MR. ELTON.

"I SHALL NEVER BE INVITED TO ABBEY-MILL AGAIN," WAS SAID IN RATHER
A SORROWFUL TONE.

"NOR, IF YOU WERE, COULD I EVER BEAR TO PART WITH YOU, MY HARRIET.
YOU ARE A GREAT DEAL TOO NECESSARY AT HARTFIELD TO BE SPARED
TO ABBEY-MILL."

"AND I AM SURE I SHOULD NEVER WANT TO GO THERE; FOR I AM NEVER HAPPY
BUT AT HARTFIELD."

SOME TIME AFTERWARDS IT WAS, "I THINK MRS. GODDARD WOULD BE VERY
MUCH SURPRIZED IF SHE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  I AM SURE MISS NASH
WOULD--FOR MISS NASH THINKS HER OWN SISTER VERY WELL MARRIED,
AND IT IS ONLY A LINEN-DRAPER."

"ONE SHOULD BE SORRY TO SEE GREATER PRIDE OR REFINEMENT IN THE
TEACHER OF A SCHOOL, HARRIET.  I DARE SAY MISS NASH WOULD ENVY YOU
SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY AS THIS OF BEING MARRIED.  EVEN THIS CONQUEST
WOULD APPEAR VALUABLE IN HER EYES.  AS TO ANY THING SUPERIOR FOR YOU,
I SUPPOSE SHE IS QUITE IN THE DARK.  THE ATTENTIONS OF A CERTAIN
PERSON CAN HARDLY BE AMONG THE TITTLE-TATTLE OF HIGHBURY YET.
HITHERTO I FANCY YOU AND I ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE TO WHOM HIS LOOKS
AND MANNERS HAVE EXPLAINED THEMSELVES."

HARRIET BLUSHED AND SMILED, AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WONDERING
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD LIKE HER SO MUCH.  THE IDEA OF MR. ELTON WAS
CERTAINLY CHEERING; BUT STILL, AFTER A TIME, SHE WAS TENDER-HEARTED
AGAIN TOWARDS THE REJECTED MR. MARTIN.

"NOW HE HAS GOT MY LETTER," SAID SHE SOFTLY.  "I WONDER WHAT THEY
ARE ALL DOING--WHETHER HIS SISTERS KNOW--IF HE IS UNHAPPY,
THEY WILL BE UNHAPPY TOO.  I HOPE HE WILL NOT MIND IT SO VERY MUCH."

"LET US THINK OF THOSE AMONG OUR ABSENT FRIENDS WHO ARE MORE
CHEERFULLY EMPLOYED," CRIED EMMA.  "AT THIS MOMENT, PERHAPS, MR. ELTON
IS SHEWING YOUR PICTURE TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS, TELLING HOW MUCH
MORE BEAUTIFUL IS THE ORIGINAL, AND AFTER BEING ASKED FOR IT FIVE
OR SIX TIMES, ALLOWING THEM TO HEAR YOUR NAME, YOUR OWN DEAR NAME."

"MY PICTURE!--BUT HE HAS LEFT MY PICTURE IN BOND-STREET."

"HAS HE SO!--THEN I KNOW NOTHING OF MR. ELTON.  NO, MY DEAR
LITTLE MODEST HARRIET, DEPEND UPON IT THE PICTURE WILL NOT BE
IN BOND-STREET TILL JUST BEFORE HE MOUNTS HIS HORSE TO-MORROW.
IT IS HIS COMPANION ALL THIS EVENING, HIS SOLACE, HIS DELIGHT.
IT OPENS HIS DESIGNS TO HIS FAMILY, IT INTRODUCES YOU AMONG THEM,
IT DIFFUSES THROUGH THE PARTY THOSE PLEASANTEST FEELINGS OF OUR NATURE,
EAGER CURIOSITY AND WARM PREPOSSESSION.  HOW CHEERFUL, HOW ANIMATED,
HOW SUSPICIOUS, HOW BUSY THEIR IMAGINATIONS ALL ARE!"

HARRIET SMILED AGAIN, AND HER SMILES GREW STRONGER.



CHAPTER VIII


HARRIET SLEPT AT HARTFIELD THAT NIGHT.  FOR SOME WEEKS PAST SHE
HAD BEEN SPENDING MORE THAN HALF HER TIME THERE, AND GRADUALLY
GETTING TO HAVE A BED-ROOM APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF; AND EMMA
JUDGED IT BEST IN EVERY RESPECT, SAFEST AND KINDEST, TO KEEP HER
WITH THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE JUST AT PRESENT.  SHE WAS OBLIGED
TO GO THE NEXT MORNING FOR AN HOUR OR TWO TO MRS. GODDARD'S,
BUT IT WAS THEN TO BE SETTLED THAT SHE SHOULD RETURN TO HARTFIELD,
TO MAKE A REGULAR VISIT OF SOME DAYS.

WHILE SHE WAS GONE, MR. KNIGHTLEY CALLED, AND SAT SOME TIME WITH
MR. WOODHOUSE AND EMMA, TILL MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE UP
HIS MIND TO WALK OUT, WAS PERSUADED BY HIS DAUGHTER NOT TO DEFER IT,
AND WAS INDUCED BY THE ENTREATIES OF BOTH, THOUGH AGAINST THE SCRUPLES
OF HIS OWN CIVILITY, TO LEAVE MR. KNIGHTLEY FOR THAT PURPOSE.
MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHO HAD NOTHING OF CEREMONY ABOUT HIM, WAS OFFERING
BY HIS SHORT, DECIDED ANSWERS, AN AMUSING CONTRAST TO THE PROTRACTED
APOLOGIES AND CIVIL HESITATIONS OF THE OTHER.

"WELL, I BELIEVE, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, MR. KNIGHTLEY, IF YOU
WILL NOT CONSIDER ME AS DOING A VERY RUDE THING, I SHALL TAKE
EMMA'S ADVICE AND GO OUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR.  AS THE SUN
IS OUT, I BELIEVE I HAD BETTER TAKE MY THREE TURNS WHILE I CAN.
I TREAT YOU WITHOUT CEREMONY, MR. KNIGHTLEY.  WE INVALIDS THINK WE
ARE PRIVILEGED PEOPLE."

"MY DEAR SIR, DO NOT MAKE A STRANGER OF ME."

"I LEAVE AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE IN MY DAUGHTER.  EMMA WILL BE HAPPY
TO ENTERTAIN YOU.  AND THEREFORE I THINK I WILL BEG YOUR EXCUSE
AND TAKE MY THREE TURNS--MY WINTER WALK."

"YOU CANNOT DO BETTER, SIR."

"I WOULD ASK FOR THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY, MR. KNIGHTLEY,
BUT I AM A VERY SLOW WALKER, AND MY PACE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO YOU;
AND, BESIDES, YOU HAVE ANOTHER LONG WALK BEFORE YOU, TO DONWELL ABBEY."

"THANK YOU, SIR, THANK YOU; I AM GOING THIS MOMENT MYSELF; AND I
THINK THE SOONER _YOU_ GO THE BETTER.  I WILL FETCH YOUR GREATCOAT
AND OPEN THE GARDEN DOOR FOR YOU."

MR. WOODHOUSE AT LAST WAS OFF; BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY, INSTEAD OF BEING
IMMEDIATELY OFF LIKEWISE, SAT DOWN AGAIN, SEEMINGLY INCLINED
FOR MORE CHAT.  HE BEGAN SPEAKING OF HARRIET, AND SPEAKING
OF HER WITH MORE VOLUNTARY PRAISE THAN EMMA HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE.

"I CANNOT RATE HER BEAUTY AS YOU DO," SAID HE; "BUT SHE IS A
PRETTY LITTLE CREATURE, AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK VERY WELL OF
HER DISPOSITION.  HER CHARACTER DEPENDS UPON THOSE SHE IS WITH;
BUT IN GOOD HANDS SHE WILL TURN OUT A VALUABLE WOMAN."

"I AM GLAD YOU THINK SO; AND THE GOOD HANDS, I HOPE, MAY NOT BE WANTING."

"COME," SAID HE, "YOU ARE ANXIOUS FOR A COMPLIMENT, SO I WILL
TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE IMPROVED HER.  YOU HAVE CURED HER OF HER
SCHOOL-GIRL'S GIGGLE; SHE REALLY DOES YOU CREDIT."

"THANK YOU.  I SHOULD BE MORTIFIED INDEED IF I DID NOT BELIEVE I
HAD BEEN OF SOME USE; BUT IT IS NOT EVERY BODY WHO WILL BESTOW
PRAISE WHERE THEY MAY.  _YOU_ DO NOT OFTEN OVERPOWER ME WITH IT."

"YOU ARE EXPECTING HER AGAIN, YOU SAY, THIS MORNING?"

"ALMOST EVERY MOMENT.  SHE HAS BEEN GONE LONGER ALREADY THAN
SHE INTENDED."

"SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO DELAY HER; SOME VISITORS PERHAPS."

"HIGHBURY GOSSIPS!--TIRESOME WRETCHES!"

"HARRIET MAY NOT CONSIDER EVERY BODY TIRESOME THAT YOU WOULD."

EMMA KNEW THIS WAS TOO TRUE FOR CONTRADICTION, AND THEREFORE
SAID NOTHING.  HE PRESENTLY ADDED, WITH A SMILE,

"I DO NOT PRETEND TO FIX ON TIMES OR PLACES, BUT I MUST TELL YOU
THAT I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE YOUR LITTLE FRIEND WILL SOON
HEAR OF SOMETHING TO HER ADVANTAGE."

"INDEED! HOW SO? OF WHAT SORT?"

"A VERY SERIOUS SORT, I ASSURE YOU;" STILL SMILING.

"VERY SERIOUS! I CAN THINK OF BUT ONE THING--WHO IS IN LOVE
WITH HER? WHO MAKES YOU THEIR CONFIDANT?"

EMMA WAS MORE THAN HALF IN HOPES OF MR. ELTON'S HAVING DROPT A HINT.
MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS A SORT OF GENERAL FRIEND AND ADVISER, AND SHE KNEW
MR. ELTON LOOKED UP TO HIM.

"I HAVE REASON TO THINK," HE REPLIED, "THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL
SOON HAVE AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE, AND FROM A MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE
QUARTER:--ROBERT MARTIN IS THE MAN.  HER VISIT TO ABBEY-MILL,
THIS SUMMER, SEEMS TO HAVE DONE HIS BUSINESS.  HE IS DESPERATELY
IN LOVE AND MEANS TO MARRY HER."

"HE IS VERY OBLIGING," SAID EMMA; "BUT IS HE SURE THAT HARRIET
MEANS TO MARRY HIM?"

"WELL, WELL, MEANS TO MAKE HER AN OFFER THEN.  WILL THAT DO? HE CAME
TO THE ABBEY TWO EVENINGS AGO, ON PURPOSE TO CONSULT ME ABOUT IT.
HE KNOWS I HAVE A THOROUGH REGARD FOR HIM AND ALL HIS FAMILY, AND,
I BELIEVE, CONSIDERS ME AS ONE OF HIS BEST FRIENDS.  HE CAME TO ASK
ME WHETHER I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT IN HIM TO SETTLE SO EARLY;
WHETHER I THOUGHT HER TOO YOUNG: IN SHORT, WHETHER I APPROVED HIS
CHOICE ALTOGETHER; HAVING SOME APPREHENSION PERHAPS OF HER BEING
CONSIDERED (ESPECIALLY SINCE _YOUR_ MAKING SO MUCH OF HER) AS IN A LINE
OF SOCIETY ABOVE HIM.  I WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH ALL THAT HE SAID.
I NEVER HEAR BETTER SENSE FROM ANY ONE THAN ROBERT MARTIN.
HE ALWAYS SPEAKS TO THE PURPOSE; OPEN, STRAIGHTFORWARD, AND VERY
WELL JUDGING.  HE TOLD ME EVERY THING; HIS CIRCUMSTANCES AND PLANS,
AND WHAT THEY ALL PROPOSED DOING IN THE EVENT OF HIS MARRIAGE.  HE IS
AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN, BOTH AS SON AND BROTHER.  I HAD NO HESITATION
IN ADVISING HIM TO MARRY.  HE PROVED TO ME THAT HE COULD AFFORD IT;
AND THAT BEING THE CASE, I WAS CONVINCED HE COULD NOT DO BETTER.
I PRAISED THE FAIR LADY TOO, AND ALTOGETHER SENT HIM AWAY VERY HAPPY.
IF HE HAD NEVER ESTEEMED MY OPINION BEFORE, HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
HIGHLY OF ME THEN; AND, I DARE SAY, LEFT THE HOUSE THINKING ME THE
BEST FRIEND AND COUNSELLOR MAN EVER HAD.  THIS HAPPENED THE NIGHT
BEFORE LAST.  NOW, AS WE MAY FAIRLY SUPPOSE, HE WOULD NOT ALLOW
MUCH TIME TO PASS BEFORE HE SPOKE TO THE LADY, AND AS HE DOES NOT
APPEAR TO HAVE SPOKEN YESTERDAY, IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT HE SHOULD
BE AT MRS. GODDARD'S TO-DAY; AND SHE MAY BE DETAINED BY A VISITOR,
WITHOUT THINKING HIM AT ALL A TIRESOME WRETCH."

"PRAY, MR. KNIGHTLEY," SAID EMMA, WHO HAD BEEN SMILING TO HERSELF
THROUGH A GREAT PART OF THIS SPEECH, "HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT MR. MARTIN
DID NOT SPEAK YESTERDAY?"

"CERTAINLY," REPLIED HE, SURPRIZED, "I DO NOT ABSOLUTELY KNOW IT;
BUT IT MAY BE INFERRED.  WAS NOT SHE THE WHOLE DAY WITH YOU?"

"COME," SAID SHE, "I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING, IN RETURN FOR WHAT
YOU HAVE TOLD ME.  HE DID SPEAK YESTERDAY--THAT IS, HE WROTE,
AND WAS REFUSED."

THIS WAS OBLIGED TO BE REPEATED BEFORE IT COULD BE BELIEVED;
AND MR. KNIGHTLEY ACTUALLY LOOKED RED WITH SURPRIZE AND DISPLEASURE,
AS HE STOOD UP, IN TALL INDIGNATION, AND SAID,

"THEN SHE IS A GREATER SIMPLETON THAN I EVER BELIEVED HER.
WHAT IS THE FOOLISH GIRL ABOUT?"

"OH! TO BE SURE," CRIED EMMA, "IT IS ALWAYS INCOMPREHENSIBLE
TO A MAN THAT A WOMAN SHOULD EVER REFUSE AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE.
A MAN ALWAYS IMAGINES A WOMAN TO BE READY FOR ANY BODY WHO ASKS HER."

"NONSENSE! A MAN DOES NOT IMAGINE ANY SUCH THING.  BUT WHAT IS
THE MEANING OF THIS? HARRIET SMITH REFUSE ROBERT MARTIN? MADNESS,
IF IT IS SO; BUT I HOPE YOU ARE MISTAKEN."

"I SAW HER ANSWER!--NOTHING COULD BE CLEARER."

"YOU SAW HER ANSWER!--YOU WROTE HER ANSWER TOO.  EMMA, THIS IS
YOUR DOING.  YOU PERSUADED HER TO REFUSE HIM."

"AND IF I DID, (WHICH, HOWEVER, I AM FAR FROM ALLOWING) I SHOULD
NOT FEEL THAT I HAD DONE WRONG.  MR. MARTIN IS A VERY RESPECTABLE
YOUNG MAN, BUT I CANNOT ADMIT HIM TO BE HARRIET'S EQUAL; AND AM
RATHER SURPRIZED INDEED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE VENTURED TO ADDRESS HER.
BY YOUR ACCOUNT, HE DOES SEEM TO HAVE HAD SOME SCRUPLES.  IT IS
A PITY THAT THEY WERE EVER GOT OVER."

"NOT HARRIET'S EQUAL!" EXCLAIMED MR. KNIGHTLEY LOUDLY AND WARMLY;
AND WITH CALMER ASPERITY, ADDED, A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARDS, "NO, HE
IS NOT HER EQUAL INDEED, FOR HE IS AS MUCH HER SUPERIOR IN SENSE
AS IN SITUATION.  EMMA, YOUR INFATUATION ABOUT THAT GIRL BLINDS YOU.
WHAT ARE HARRIET SMITH'S CLAIMS, EITHER OF BIRTH, NATURE OR EDUCATION,
TO ANY CONNEXION HIGHER THAN ROBERT MARTIN? SHE IS THE NATURAL
DAUGHTER OF NOBODY KNOWS WHOM, WITH PROBABLY NO SETTLED PROVISION
AT ALL, AND CERTAINLY NO RESPECTABLE RELATIONS.  SHE IS KNOWN ONLY
AS PARLOUR-BOARDER AT A COMMON SCHOOL.  SHE IS NOT A SENSIBLE GIRL,
NOR A GIRL OF ANY INFORMATION.  SHE HAS BEEN TAUGHT NOTHING USEFUL,
AND IS TOO YOUNG AND TOO SIMPLE TO HAVE ACQUIRED ANY THING HERSELF.
AT HER AGE SHE CAN HAVE NO EXPERIENCE, AND WITH HER LITTLE WIT,
IS NOT VERY LIKELY EVER TO HAVE ANY THAT CAN AVAIL HER.
SHE IS PRETTY, AND SHE IS GOOD TEMPERED, AND THAT IS ALL.
MY ONLY SCRUPLE IN ADVISING THE MATCH WAS ON HIS ACCOUNT, AS BEING
BENEATH HIS DESERTS, AND A BAD CONNEXION FOR HIM.  I FELT THAT,
AS TO FORTUNE, IN ALL PROBABILITY HE MIGHT DO MUCH BETTER; AND THAT AS
TO A RATIONAL COMPANION OR USEFUL HELPMATE, HE COULD NOT DO WORSE.
BUT I COULD NOT REASON SO TO A MAN IN LOVE, AND WAS WILLING
TO TRUST TO THERE BEING NO HARM IN HER, TO HER HAVING THAT SORT
OF DISPOSITION, WHICH, IN GOOD HANDS, LIKE HIS, MIGHT BE EASILY LED
ARIGHT AND TURN OUT VERY WELL.  THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MATCH I FELT
TO BE ALL ON HER SIDE; AND HAD NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT (NOR HAVE I NOW)
THAT THERE WOULD BE A GENERAL CRY-OUT UPON HER EXTREME GOOD LUCK.
EVEN _YOUR_ SATISFACTION I MADE SURE OF.  IT CROSSED MY MIND IMMEDIATELY
THAT YOU WOULD NOT REGRET YOUR FRIEND'S LEAVING HIGHBURY, FOR THE
SAKE OF HER BEING SETTLED SO WELL.  I REMEMBER SAYING TO MYSELF,
`EVEN EMMA, WITH ALL HER PARTIALITY FOR HARRIET, WILL THINK THIS A
GOOD MATCH.'"

"I CANNOT HELP WONDERING AT YOUR KNOWING SO LITTLE OF EMMA AS TO SAY
ANY SUCH THING.  WHAT! THINK A FARMER, (AND WITH ALL HIS SENSE AND ALL
HIS MERIT MR. MARTIN IS NOTHING MORE,) A GOOD MATCH FOR MY INTIMATE
FRIEND! NOT REGRET HER LEAVING HIGHBURY FOR THE SAKE OF MARRYING
A MAN WHOM I COULD NEVER ADMIT AS AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MY OWN! I
WONDER YOU SHOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO HAVE SUCH FEELINGS.
I ASSURE YOU MINE ARE VERY DIFFERENT.  I MUST THINK YOUR STATEMENT
BY NO MEANS FAIR.  YOU ARE NOT JUST TO HARRIET'S CLAIMS.
THEY WOULD BE ESTIMATED VERY DIFFERENTLY BY OTHERS AS WELL AS MYSELF;
MR. MARTIN MAY BE THE RICHEST OF THE TWO, BUT HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY
HER INFERIOR AS TO RANK IN SOCIETY.--THE SPHERE IN WHICH SHE MOVES
IS MUCH ABOVE HIS.--IT WOULD BE A DEGRADATION."

"A DEGRADATION TO ILLEGITIMACY AND IGNORANCE, TO BE MARRIED
TO A RESPECTABLE, INTELLIGENT GENTLEMAN-FARMER!"

"AS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER BIRTH, THOUGH IN A LEGAL SENSE
SHE MAY BE CALLED NOBODY, IT WILL NOT HOLD IN COMMON SENSE.
SHE IS NOT TO PAY FOR THE OFFENCE OF OTHERS, BY BEING HELD BELOW
THE LEVEL OF THOSE WITH WHOM SHE IS BROUGHT UP.--THERE CAN SCARCELY
BE A DOUBT THAT HER FATHER IS A GENTLEMAN--AND A GENTLEMAN OF
FORTUNE.--HER ALLOWANCE IS VERY LIBERAL; NOTHING HAS EVER BEEN GRUDGED
FOR HER IMPROVEMENT OR COMFORT.--THAT SHE IS A GENTLEMAN'S DAUGHTER,
IS INDUBITABLE TO ME; THAT SHE ASSOCIATES WITH GENTLEMEN'S DAUGHTERS,
NO ONE, I APPREHEND, WILL DENY.--SHE IS SUPERIOR TO MR. ROBERT MARTIN."

"WHOEVER MIGHT BE HER PARENTS," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, "WHOEVER MAY
HAVE HAD THE CHARGE OF HER, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ANY PART
OF THEIR PLAN TO INTRODUCE HER INTO WHAT YOU WOULD CALL GOOD SOCIETY.
AFTER RECEIVING A VERY INDIFFERENT EDUCATION SHE IS LEFT IN
MRS. GODDARD'S HANDS TO SHIFT AS SHE CAN;--TO MOVE, IN SHORT,
IN MRS. GODDARD'S LINE, TO HAVE MRS. GODDARD'S ACQUAINTANCE.
HER FRIENDS EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THIS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER; AND IT _WAS_
GOOD ENOUGH.  SHE DESIRED NOTHING BETTER HERSELF.  TILL YOU CHOSE
TO TURN HER INTO A FRIEND, HER MIND HAD NO DISTASTE FOR HER OWN SET,
NOR ANY AMBITION BEYOND IT.  SHE WAS AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE WITH THE
MARTINS IN THE SUMMER.  SHE HAD NO SENSE OF SUPERIORITY THEN.
IF SHE HAS IT NOW, YOU HAVE GIVEN IT.  YOU HAVE BEEN NO FRIEND TO
HARRIET SMITH, EMMA.  ROBERT MARTIN WOULD NEVER HAVE PROCEEDED SO FAR,
IF HE HAD NOT FELT PERSUADED OF HER NOT BEING DISINCLINED TO HIM.
I KNOW HIM WELL.  HE HAS TOO MUCH REAL FEELING TO ADDRESS ANY
WOMAN ON THE HAPHAZARD OF SELFISH PASSION.  AND AS TO CONCEIT,
HE IS THE FARTHEST FROM IT OF ANY MAN I KNOW.  DEPEND UPON IT HE
HAD ENCOURAGEMENT."

IT WAS MOST CONVENIENT TO EMMA NOT TO MAKE A DIRECT REPLY TO THIS
ASSERTION; SHE CHOSE RATHER TO TAKE UP HER OWN LINE OF THE SUBJECT AGAIN.

"YOU ARE A VERY WARM FRIEND TO MR. MARTIN; BUT, AS I SAID BEFORE,
ARE UNJUST TO HARRIET.  HARRIET'S CLAIMS TO MARRY WELL ARE NOT
SO CONTEMPTIBLE AS YOU REPRESENT THEM.  SHE IS NOT A CLEVER GIRL,
BUT SHE HAS BETTER SENSE THAN YOU ARE AWARE OF, AND DOES NOT
DESERVE TO HAVE HER UNDERSTANDING SPOKEN OF SO SLIGHTINGLY.
WAIVING THAT POINT, HOWEVER, AND SUPPOSING HER TO BE, AS YOU
DESCRIBE HER, ONLY PRETTY AND GOOD-NATURED, LET ME TELL YOU, THAT IN
THE DEGREE SHE POSSESSES THEM, THEY ARE NOT TRIVIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
TO THE WORLD IN GENERAL, FOR SHE IS, IN FACT, A BEAUTIFUL GIRL,
AND MUST BE THOUGHT SO BY NINETY-NINE PEOPLE OUT OF AN HUNDRED;
AND TILL IT APPEARS THAT MEN ARE MUCH MORE PHILOSOPHIC ON THE SUBJECT
OF BEAUTY THAN THEY ARE GENERALLY SUPPOSED; TILL THEY DO FALL
IN LOVE WITH WELL-INFORMED MINDS INSTEAD OF HANDSOME FACES, A GIRL,
WITH SUCH LOVELINESS AS HARRIET, HAS A CERTAINTY OF BEING ADMIRED
AND SOUGHT AFTER, OF HAVING THE POWER OF CHUSING FROM AMONG MANY,
CONSEQUENTLY A CLAIM TO BE NICE.  HER GOOD-NATURE, TOO, IS NOT SO VERY
SLIGHT A CLAIM, COMPREHENDING, AS IT DOES, REAL, THOROUGH SWEETNESS
OF TEMPER AND MANNER, A VERY HUMBLE OPINION OF HERSELF, AND A GREAT
READINESS TO BE PLEASED WITH OTHER PEOPLE.  I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
IF YOUR SEX IN GENERAL WOULD NOT THINK SUCH BEAUTY, AND SUCH TEMPER,
THE HIGHEST CLAIMS A WOMAN COULD POSSESS."

"UPON MY WORD, EMMA, TO HEAR YOU ABUSING THE REASON YOU HAVE,
IS ALMOST ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK SO TOO.  BETTER BE WITHOUT SENSE,
THAN MISAPPLY IT AS YOU DO."

"TO BE SURE!" CRIED SHE PLAYFULLY.  "I KNOW _THAT_ IS THE FEELING
OF YOU ALL.  I KNOW THAT SUCH A GIRL AS HARRIET IS EXACTLY
WHAT EVERY MAN DELIGHTS IN--WHAT AT ONCE BEWITCHES HIS SENSES
AND SATISFIES HIS JUDGMENT.  OH! HARRIET MAY PICK AND CHUSE.
WERE YOU, YOURSELF, EVER TO MARRY, SHE IS THE VERY WOMAN FOR YOU.
AND IS SHE, AT SEVENTEEN, JUST ENTERING INTO LIFE, JUST BEGINNING
TO BE KNOWN, TO BE WONDERED AT BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT ACCEPT THE FIRST
OFFER SHE RECEIVES? NO--PRAY LET HER HAVE TIME TO LOOK ABOUT HER."

"I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT A VERY FOOLISH INTIMACY," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY
PRESENTLY, "THOUGH I HAVE KEPT MY THOUGHTS TO MYSELF; BUT I NOW
PERCEIVE THAT IT WILL BE A VERY UNFORTUNATE ONE FOR HARRIET.
YOU WILL PUFF HER UP WITH SUCH IDEAS OF HER OWN BEAUTY, AND OF WHAT
SHE HAS A CLAIM TO, THAT, IN A LITTLE WHILE, NOBODY WITHIN HER
REACH WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.  VANITY WORKING ON A WEAK HEAD,
PRODUCES EVERY SORT OF MISCHIEF.  NOTHING SO EASY AS FOR A YOUNG LADY
TO RAISE HER EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH.  MISS HARRIET SMITH MAY NOT FIND
OFFERS OF MARRIAGE FLOW IN SO FAST, THOUGH SHE IS A VERY PRETTY GIRL.
MEN OF SENSE, WHATEVER YOU MAY CHUSE TO SAY, DO NOT WANT SILLY WIVES.
MEN OF FAMILY WOULD NOT BE VERY FOND OF CONNECTING THEMSELVES
WITH A GIRL OF SUCH OBSCURITY--AND MOST PRUDENT MEN WOULD BE
AFRAID OF THE INCONVENIENCE AND DISGRACE THEY MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN,
WHEN THE MYSTERY OF HER PARENTAGE CAME TO BE REVEALED.  LET HER MARRY
ROBERT MARTIN, AND SHE IS SAFE, RESPECTABLE, AND HAPPY FOR EVER;
BUT IF YOU ENCOURAGE HER TO EXPECT TO MARRY GREATLY, AND TEACH
HER TO BE SATISFIED WITH NOTHING LESS THAN A MAN OF CONSEQUENCE
AND LARGE FORTUNE, SHE MAY BE A PARLOUR-BOARDER AT MRS. GODDARD'S
ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE--OR, AT LEAST, (FOR HARRIET SMITH IS A
GIRL WHO WILL MARRY SOMEBODY OR OTHER,) TILL SHE GROW DESPERATE,
AND IS GLAD TO CATCH AT THE OLD WRITING-MASTER'S SON."

"WE THINK SO VERY DIFFERENTLY ON THIS POINT, MR. KNIGHTLEY,
THAT THERE CAN BE NO USE IN CANVASSING IT.  WE SHALL ONLY BE MAKING
EACH OTHER MORE ANGRY.  BUT AS TO MY _LETTING_ HER MARRY ROBERT MARTIN,
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE; SHE HAS REFUSED HIM, AND SO DECIDEDLY, I THINK,
AS MUST PREVENT ANY SECOND APPLICATION.  SHE MUST ABIDE BY THE EVIL
OF HAVING REFUSED HIM, WHATEVER IT MAY BE; AND AS TO THE REFUSAL ITSELF,
I WILL NOT PRETEND TO SAY THAT I MIGHT NOT INFLUENCE HER A LITTLE;
BUT I ASSURE YOU THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FOR ME OR FOR ANY BODY TO DO.
HIS APPEARANCE IS SO MUCH AGAINST HIM, AND HIS MANNER SO BAD,
THAT IF SHE EVER WERE DISPOSED TO FAVOUR HIM, SHE IS NOT NOW.
I CAN IMAGINE, THAT BEFORE SHE HAD SEEN ANY BODY SUPERIOR,
SHE MIGHT TOLERATE HIM.  HE WAS THE BROTHER OF HER FRIENDS,
AND HE TOOK PAINS TO PLEASE HER; AND ALTOGETHER, HAVING SEEN
NOBODY BETTER (THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS GREAT ASSISTANT)
SHE MIGHT NOT, WHILE SHE WAS AT ABBEY-MILL, FIND HIM DISAGREEABLE.
BUT THE CASE IS ALTERED NOW.  SHE KNOWS NOW WHAT GENTLEMEN ARE;
AND NOTHING BUT A GENTLEMAN IN EDUCATION AND MANNER HAS ANY CHANCE
WITH HARRIET."

"NONSENSE, ERRANT NONSENSE, AS EVER WAS TALKED!" CRIED MR. KNIGHTLEY.--"ROBERT
MARTIN'S MANNERS HAVE SENSE, SINCERITY, AND GOOD-HUMOUR TO RECOMMEND
THEM; AND HIS MIND HAS MORE TRUE GENTILITY THAN HARRIET SMITH COULD UNDERSTAND."

EMMA MADE NO ANSWER, AND TRIED TO LOOK CHEERFULLY UNCONCERNED, BUT WAS
REALLY FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE AND WANTING HIM VERY MUCH TO BE GONE.
SHE DID NOT REPENT WHAT SHE HAD DONE; SHE STILL THOUGHT HERSELF
A BETTER JUDGE OF SUCH A POINT OF FEMALE RIGHT AND REFINEMENT THAN HE
COULD BE; BUT YET SHE HAD A SORT OF HABITUAL RESPECT FOR HIS JUDGMENT
IN GENERAL, WHICH MADE HER DISLIKE HAVING IT SO LOUDLY AGAINST HER;
AND TO HAVE HIM SITTING JUST OPPOSITE TO HER IN ANGRY STATE,
WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE.  SOME MINUTES PASSED IN THIS UNPLEASANT SILENCE,
WITH ONLY ONE ATTEMPT ON EMMA'S SIDE TO TALK OF THE WEATHER,
BUT HE MADE NO ANSWER.  HE WAS THINKING.  THE RESULT OF HIS THOUGHTS
APPEARED AT LAST IN THESE WORDS.

"ROBERT MARTIN HAS NO GREAT LOSS--IF HE CAN BUT THINK SO; AND I
HOPE IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE HE DOES.  YOUR VIEWS FOR HARRIET
ARE BEST KNOWN TO YOURSELF; BUT AS YOU MAKE NO SECRET OF YOUR LOVE
OF MATCH-MAKING, IT IS FAIR TO SUPPOSE THAT VIEWS, AND PLANS,
AND PROJECTS YOU HAVE;--AND AS A FRIEND I SHALL JUST HINT TO YOU
THAT IF ELTON IS THE MAN, I THINK IT WILL BE ALL LABOUR IN VAIN."

EMMA LAUGHED AND DISCLAIMED.  HE CONTINUED,

"DEPEND UPON IT, ELTON WILL NOT DO.  ELTON IS A VERY GOOD SORT OF MAN,
AND A VERY RESPECTABLE VICAR OF HIGHBURY, BUT NOT AT ALL LIKELY
TO MAKE AN IMPRUDENT MATCH.  HE KNOWS THE VALUE OF A GOOD INCOME
AS WELL AS ANY BODY.  ELTON MAY TALK SENTIMENTALLY, BUT HE WILL
ACT RATIONALLY.  HE IS AS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS OWN CLAIMS, AS YOU
CAN BE WITH HARRIET'S. HE KNOWS THAT HE IS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN,
AND A GREAT FAVOURITE WHEREVER HE GOES; AND FROM HIS GENERAL WAY
OF TALKING IN UNRESERVED MOMENTS, WHEN THERE ARE ONLY MEN PRESENT,
I AM CONVINCED THAT HE DOES NOT MEAN TO THROW HIMSELF AWAY.
I HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAK WITH GREAT ANIMATION OF A LARGE FAMILY
OF YOUNG LADIES THAT HIS SISTERS ARE INTIMATE WITH, WHO HAVE ALL
TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS APIECE."

"I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU," SAID EMMA, LAUGHING AGAIN.
"IF I HAD SET MY HEART ON MR. ELTON'S MARRYING HARRIET, IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TO OPEN MY EYES; BUT AT PRESENT I ONLY WANT
TO KEEP HARRIET TO MYSELF.  I HAVE DONE WITH MATCH-MAKING INDEED.
I COULD NEVER HOPE TO EQUAL MY OWN DOINGS AT RANDALLS.  I SHALL LEAVE
OFF WHILE I AM WELL."

"GOOD MORNING TO YOU,"--SAID HE, RISING AND WALKING OFF ABRUPTLY.
HE WAS VERY MUCH VEXED.  HE FELT THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE YOUNG MAN,
AND WAS MORTIFIED TO HAVE BEEN THE MEANS OF PROMOTING IT, BY THE
SANCTION HE HAD GIVEN; AND THE PART WHICH HE WAS PERSUADED EMMA HAD
TAKEN IN THE AFFAIR, WAS PROVOKING HIM EXCEEDINGLY.

EMMA REMAINED IN A STATE OF VEXATION TOO; BUT THERE WAS MORE
INDISTINCTNESS IN THE CAUSES OF HER'S, THAN IN HIS.  SHE DID NOT ALWAYS
FEEL SO ABSOLUTELY SATISFIED WITH HERSELF, SO ENTIRELY CONVINCED THAT
HER OPINIONS WERE RIGHT AND HER ADVERSARY'S WRONG, AS MR. KNIGHTLEY.
HE WALKED OFF IN MORE COMPLETE SELF-APPROBATION THAN HE LEFT FOR HER.
SHE WAS NOT SO MATERIALLY CAST DOWN, HOWEVER, BUT THAT A LITTLE
TIME AND THE RETURN OF HARRIET WERE VERY ADEQUATE RESTORATIVES.
HARRIET'S STAYING AWAY SO LONG WAS BEGINNING TO MAKE HER UNEASY.
THE POSSIBILITY OF THE YOUNG MAN'S COMING TO MRS. GODDARD'S
THAT MORNING, AND MEETING WITH HARRIET AND PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE,
GAVE ALARMING IDEAS.  THE DREAD OF SUCH A FAILURE AFTER ALL BECAME THE
PROMINENT UNEASINESS; AND WHEN HARRIET APPEARED, AND IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS,
AND WITHOUT HAVING ANY SUCH REASON TO GIVE FOR HER LONG ABSENCE,
SHE FELT A SATISFACTION WHICH SETTLED HER WITH HER OWN MIND,
AND CONVINCED HER, THAT LET MR. KNIGHTLEY THINK OR SAY WHAT HE WOULD,
SHE HAD DONE NOTHING WHICH WOMAN'S FRIENDSHIP AND WOMAN'S FEELINGS
WOULD NOT JUSTIFY.

HE HAD FRIGHTENED HER A LITTLE ABOUT MR. ELTON; BUT WHEN SHE CONSIDERED
THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY COULD NOT HAVE OBSERVED HIM AS SHE HAD DONE,
NEITHER WITH THE INTEREST, NOR (SHE MUST BE ALLOWED TO TELL HERSELF,
IN SPITE OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S PRETENSIONS) WITH THE SKILL OF SUCH
AN OBSERVER ON SUCH A QUESTION AS HERSELF, THAT HE HAD SPOKEN IT
HASTILY AND IN ANGER, SHE WAS ABLE TO BELIEVE, THAT HE HAD RATHER
SAID WHAT HE WISHED RESENTFULLY TO BE TRUE, THAN WHAT HE KNEW
ANY THING ABOUT.  HE CERTAINLY MIGHT HAVE HEARD MR. ELTON SPEAK
WITH MORE UNRESERVE THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE, AND MR. ELTON MIGHT NOT
BE OF AN IMPRUDENT, INCONSIDERATE DISPOSITION AS TO MONEY MATTERS;
HE MIGHT NATURALLY BE RATHER ATTENTIVE THAN OTHERWISE TO THEM;
BUT THEN, MR. KNIGHTLEY DID NOT MAKE DUE ALLOWANCE FOR THE INFLUENCE
OF A STRONG PASSION AT WAR WITH ALL INTERESTED MOTIVES.  MR. KNIGHTLEY
SAW NO SUCH PASSION, AND OF COURSE THOUGHT NOTHING OF ITS EFFECTS;
BUT SHE SAW TOO MUCH OF IT TO FEEL A DOUBT OF ITS OVERCOMING ANY
HESITATIONS THAT A REASONABLE PRUDENCE MIGHT ORIGINALLY SUGGEST;
AND MORE THAN A REASONABLE, BECOMING DEGREE OF PRUDENCE, SHE WAS VERY
SURE DID NOT BELONG TO MR. ELTON.

HARRIET'S CHEERFUL LOOK AND MANNER ESTABLISHED HERS: SHE CAME BACK,
NOT TO THINK OF MR. MARTIN, BUT TO TALK OF MR. ELTON.  MISS NASH
HAD BEEN TELLING HER SOMETHING, WHICH SHE REPEATED IMMEDIATELY
WITH GREAT DELIGHT.  MR. PERRY HAD BEEN TO MRS. GODDARD'S TO ATTEND
A SICK CHILD, AND MISS NASH HAD SEEN HIM, AND HE HAD TOLD MISS NASH,
THAT AS HE WAS COMING BACK YESTERDAY FROM CLAYTON PARK, HE HAD MET
MR. ELTON, AND FOUND TO HIS GREAT SURPRIZE, THAT MR. ELTON WAS
ACTUALLY ON HIS ROAD TO LONDON, AND NOT MEANING TO RETURN TILL
THE MORROW, THOUGH IT WAS THE WHIST-CLUB NIGHT, WHICH HE HAD BEEN
NEVER KNOWN TO MISS BEFORE; AND MR. PERRY HAD REMONSTRATED WITH HIM
ABOUT IT, AND TOLD HIM HOW SHABBY IT WAS IN HIM, THEIR BEST PLAYER,
TO ABSENT HIMSELF, AND TRIED VERY MUCH TO PERSUADE HIM TO PUT OFF
HIS JOURNEY ONLY ONE DAY; BUT IT WOULD NOT DO; MR. ELTON HAD BEEN
DETERMINED TO GO ON, AND HAD SAID IN A _VERY_ _PARTICULAR_ WAY INDEED,
THAT HE WAS GOING ON BUSINESS WHICH HE WOULD NOT PUT OFF FOR ANY
INDUCEMENT IN THE WORLD; AND SOMETHING ABOUT A VERY ENVIABLE COMMISSION,
AND BEING THE BEARER OF SOMETHING EXCEEDINGLY PRECIOUS.  MR. PERRY
COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HIM, BUT HE WAS VERY SURE THERE MUST
BE A _LADY_ IN THE CASE, AND HE TOLD HIM SO; AND MR. ELTON ONLY
LOOKED VERY CONSCIOUS AND SMILING, AND RODE OFF IN GREAT SPIRITS.
MISS NASH HAD TOLD HER ALL THIS, AND HAD TALKED A GREAT DEAL MORE
ABOUT MR. ELTON; AND SAID, LOOKING SO VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AT HER,
"THAT SHE DID NOT PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS BUSINESS MIGHT BE,
BUT SHE ONLY KNEW THAT ANY WOMAN WHOM MR. ELTON COULD PREFER,
SHE SHOULD THINK THE LUCKIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD; FOR, BEYOND A DOUBT,
MR. ELTON HAD NOT HIS EQUAL FOR BEAUTY OR AGREEABLENESS."



CHAPTER IX


MR. KNIGHTLEY MIGHT QUARREL WITH HER, BUT EMMA COULD NOT QUARREL
WITH HERSELF.  HE WAS SO MUCH DISPLEASED, THAT IT WAS LONGER THAN
USUAL BEFORE HE CAME TO HARTFIELD AGAIN; AND WHEN THEY DID MEET,
HIS GRAVE LOOKS SHEWED THAT SHE WAS NOT FORGIVEN.  SHE WAS SORRY,
BUT COULD NOT REPENT.  ON THE CONTRARY, HER PLANS AND PROCEEDINGS
WERE MORE AND MORE JUSTIFIED AND ENDEARED TO HER BY THE GENERAL
APPEARANCES OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

THE PICTURE, ELEGANTLY FRAMED, CAME SAFELY TO HAND SOON AFTER
MR. ELTON'S RETURN, AND BEING HUNG OVER THE MANTELPIECE OF THE COMMON
SITTING-ROOM, HE GOT UP TO LOOK AT IT, AND SIGHED OUT HIS HALF SENTENCES
OF ADMIRATION JUST AS HE OUGHT; AND AS FOR HARRIET'S FEELINGS, THEY WERE
VISIBLY FORMING THEMSELVES INTO AS STRONG AND STEADY AN ATTACHMENT
AS HER YOUTH AND SORT OF MIND ADMITTED.  EMMA WAS SOON PERFECTLY
SATISFIED OF MR. MARTIN'S BEING NO OTHERWISE REMEMBERED, THAN AS
HE FURNISHED A CONTRAST WITH MR. ELTON, OF THE UTMOST ADVANTAGE TO THE LATTER.

HER VIEWS OF IMPROVING HER LITTLE FRIEND'S MIND, BY A GREAT DEAL
OF USEFUL READING AND CONVERSATION, HAD NEVER YET LED TO MORE THAN
A FEW FIRST CHAPTERS, AND THE INTENTION OF GOING ON TO-MORROW.
IT WAS MUCH EASIER TO CHAT THAN TO STUDY; MUCH PLEASANTER TO LET
HER IMAGINATION RANGE AND WORK AT HARRIET'S FORTUNE, THAN TO BE
LABOURING TO ENLARGE HER COMPREHENSION OR EXERCISE IT ON SOBER FACTS;
AND THE ONLY LITERARY PURSUIT WHICH ENGAGED HARRIET AT PRESENT,
THE ONLY MENTAL PROVISION SHE WAS MAKING FOR THE EVENING OF LIFE,
WAS THE COLLECTING AND TRANSCRIBING ALL THE RIDDLES OF EVERY SORT
THAT SHE COULD MEET WITH, INTO A THIN QUARTO OF HOT-PRESSED PAPER,
MADE UP BY HER FRIEND, AND ORNAMENTED WITH CIPHERS AND TROPHIES.

IN THIS AGE OF LITERATURE, SUCH COLLECTIONS ON A VERY GRAND SCALE
ARE NOT UNCOMMON.  MISS NASH, HEAD-TEACHER AT MRS. GODDARD'S,
HAD WRITTEN OUT AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED; AND HARRIET, WHO HAD TAKEN
THE FIRST HINT OF IT FROM HER, HOPED, WITH MISS WOODHOUSE'S HELP,
TO GET A GREAT MANY MORE.  EMMA ASSISTED WITH HER INVENTION,
MEMORY AND TASTE; AND AS HARRIET WROTE A VERY PRETTY HAND,
IT WAS LIKELY TO BE AN ARRANGEMENT OF THE FIRST ORDER, IN FORM
AS WELL AS QUANTITY.

MR. WOODHOUSE WAS ALMOST AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE BUSINESS AS THE GIRLS,
AND TRIED VERY OFTEN TO RECOLLECT SOMETHING WORTH THEIR PUTTING IN.
"SO MANY CLEVER RIDDLES AS THERE USED TO BE WHEN HE WAS YOUNG--HE
WONDERED HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THEM! BUT HE HOPED HE SHOULD IN TIME."
AND IT ALWAYS ENDED IN "KITTY, A FAIR BUT FROZEN MAID."

HIS GOOD FRIEND PERRY, TOO, WHOM HE HAD SPOKEN TO ON THE SUBJECT,
DID NOT AT PRESENT RECOLLECT ANY THING OF THE RIDDLE KIND;
BUT HE HAD DESIRED PERRY TO BE UPON THE WATCH, AND AS HE WENT ABOUT
SO MUCH, SOMETHING, HE THOUGHT, MIGHT COME FROM THAT QUARTER.

IT WAS BY NO MEANS HIS DAUGHTER'S WISH THAT THE INTELLECTS OF
HIGHBURY IN GENERAL SHOULD BE PUT UNDER REQUISITION.  MR. ELTON
WAS THE ONLY ONE WHOSE ASSISTANCE SHE ASKED.  HE WAS INVITED
TO CONTRIBUTE ANY REALLY GOOD ENIGMAS, CHARADES, OR CONUNDRUMS
THAT HE MIGHT RECOLLECT; AND SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HIM
MOST INTENTLY AT WORK WITH HIS RECOLLECTIONS; AND AT THE SAME TIME,
AS SHE COULD PERCEIVE, MOST EARNESTLY CAREFUL THAT NOTHING UNGALLANT,
NOTHING THAT DID NOT BREATHE A COMPLIMENT TO THE SEX SHOULD PASS
HIS LIPS.  THEY OWED TO HIM THEIR TWO OR THREE POLITEST PUZZLES;
AND THE JOY AND EXULTATION WITH WHICH AT LAST HE RECALLED,
AND RATHER SENTIMENTALLY RECITED, THAT WELL-KNOWN CHARADE,

    MY FIRST DOTH AFFLICTION DENOTE,
      WHICH MY SECOND IS DESTIN'D TO FEEL
    AND MY WHOLE IS THE BEST ANTIDOTE
      THAT AFFLICTION TO SOFTEN AND HEAL.--

MADE HER QUITE SORRY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD TRANSCRIBED IT
SOME PAGES AGO ALREADY.

"WHY WILL NOT YOU WRITE ONE YOURSELF FOR US, MR. ELTON?" SAID SHE;
"THAT IS THE ONLY SECURITY FOR ITS FRESHNESS; AND NOTHING COULD BE
EASIER TO YOU."

"OH NO! HE HAD NEVER WRITTEN, HARDLY EVER, ANY THING OF THE KIND
IN HIS LIFE.  THE STUPIDEST FELLOW! HE WAS AFRAID NOT EVEN MISS
WOODHOUSE"--HE STOPT A MOMENT--"OR MISS SMITH COULD INSPIRE HIM."

THE VERY NEXT DAY HOWEVER PRODUCED SOME PROOF OF INSPIRATION.
HE CALLED FOR A FEW MOMENTS, JUST TO LEAVE A PIECE OF PAPER ON THE
TABLE CONTAINING, AS HE SAID, A CHARADE, WHICH A FRIEND OF HIS HAD
ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY, THE OBJECT OF HIS ADMIRATION, BUT WHICH,
FROM HIS MANNER, EMMA WAS IMMEDIATELY CONVINCED MUST BE HIS OWN.

"I DO NOT OFFER IT FOR MISS SMITH'S COLLECTION," SAID HE.
"BEING MY FRIEND'S, I HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPOSE IT IN ANY DEGREE
TO THE PUBLIC EYE, BUT PERHAPS YOU MAY NOT DISLIKE LOOKING AT IT."

THE SPEECH WAS MORE TO EMMA THAN TO HARRIET, WHICH EMMA
COULD UNDERSTAND.  THERE WAS DEEP CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT HIM,
AND HE FOUND IT EASIER TO MEET HER EYE THAN HER FRIEND'S.
HE WAS GONE THE NEXT MOMENT:--AFTER ANOTHER MOMENT'S PAUSE,

"TAKE IT," SAID EMMA, SMILING, AND PUSHING THE PAPER TOWARDS
HARRIET--"IT IS FOR YOU.  TAKE YOUR OWN."

BUT HARRIET WAS IN A TREMOR, AND COULD NOT TOUCH IT; AND EMMA,
NEVER LOTH TO BE FIRST, WAS OBLIGED TO EXAMINE IT HERSELF.

        TO MISS--

          CHARADE.

    MY FIRST DISPLAYS THE WEALTH AND POMP OF KINGS,
      LORDS OF THE EARTH! THEIR LUXURY AND EASE.
    ANOTHER VIEW OF MAN, MY SECOND BRINGS,
      BEHOLD HIM THERE, THE MONARCH OF THE SEAS!

    BUT AH! UNITED, WHAT REVERSE WE HAVE!
      MAN'S BOASTED POWER AND FREEDOM, ALL ARE FLOWN;
    LORD OF THE EARTH AND SEA, HE BENDS A SLAVE,
      AND WOMAN, LOVELY WOMAN, REIGNS ALONE.

      THY READY WIT THE WORD WILL SOON SUPPLY,
      MAY ITS APPROVAL BEAM IN THAT SOFT EYE!

SHE CAST HER EYE OVER IT, PONDERED, CAUGHT THE MEANING, READ IT THROUGH
AGAIN TO BE QUITE CERTAIN, AND QUITE MISTRESS OF THE LINES, AND THEN
PASSING IT TO HARRIET, SAT HAPPILY SMILING, AND SAYING TO HERSELF,
WHILE HARRIET WAS PUZZLING OVER THE PAPER IN ALL THE CONFUSION
OF HOPE AND DULNESS, "VERY WELL, MR. ELTON, VERY WELL INDEED.
I HAVE READ WORSE CHARADES.  _COURTSHIP_--A VERY GOOD HINT.  I GIVE
YOU CREDIT FOR IT.  THIS IS FEELING YOUR WAY.  THIS IS SAYING VERY
PLAINLY--`PRAY, MISS SMITH, GIVE ME LEAVE TO PAY MY ADDRESSES TO YOU.
APPROVE MY CHARADE AND MY INTENTIONS IN THE SAME GLANCE.'

      MAY ITS APPROVAL BEAM IN THAT SOFT EYE!

HARRIET EXACTLY.  SOFT IS THE VERY WORD FOR HER EYE--OF ALL EPITHETS,
THE JUSTEST THAT COULD BE GIVEN.

      THY READY WIT THE WORD WILL SOON SUPPLY.

HUMPH--HARRIET'S READY WIT! ALL THE BETTER.  A MAN MUST BE VERY MUCH
IN LOVE, INDEED, TO DESCRIBE HER SO.  AH! MR. KNIGHTLEY, I WISH
YOU HAD THE BENEFIT OF THIS; I THINK THIS WOULD CONVINCE YOU.
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE YOU WOULD BE OBLIGED TO OWN YOURSELF MISTAKEN.
AN EXCELLENT CHARADE INDEED! AND VERY MUCH TO THE PURPOSE.
THINGS MUST COME TO A CRISIS SOON NOW.

SHE WAS OBLIGED TO BREAK OFF FROM THESE VERY PLEASANT OBSERVATIONS,
WHICH WERE OTHERWISE OF A SORT TO RUN INTO GREAT LENGTH, BY THE
EAGERNESS OF HARRIET'S WONDERING QUESTIONS.

"WHAT CAN IT BE, MISS WOODHOUSE?--WHAT CAN IT BE? I HAVE NOT AN IDEA--I
CANNOT GUESS IT IN THE LEAST.  WHAT CAN IT POSSIBLY BE? DO TRY
TO FIND IT OUT, MISS WOODHOUSE.  DO HELP ME.  I NEVER SAW ANY THING
SO HARD.  IS IT KINGDOM? I WONDER WHO THE FRIEND WAS--AND WHO COULD
BE THE YOUNG LADY.  DO YOU THINK IT IS A GOOD ONE? CAN IT BE WOMAN?

      AND WOMAN, LOVELY WOMAN, REIGNS ALONE.

CAN IT BE NEPTUNE?

      BEHOLD HIM THERE, THE MONARCH OF THE SEAS!

OR A TRIDENT? OR A MERMAID? OR A SHARK? OH, NO! SHARK IS ONLY
ONE SYLLABLE.  IT MUST BE VERY CLEVER, OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT IT.
OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, DO YOU THINK WE SHALL EVER FIND IT OUT?"

"MERMAIDS AND SHARKS! NONSENSE! MY DEAR HARRIET, WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING OF? WHERE WOULD BE THE USE OF HIS BRINGING US A CHARADE MADE
BY A FRIEND UPON A MERMAID OR A SHARK? GIVE ME THE PAPER AND LISTEN.

FOR MISS ----------, READ MISS SMITH.

    MY FIRST DISPLAYS THE WEALTH AND POMP OF KINGS,
      LORDS OF THE EARTH! THEIR LUXURY AND EASE.

THAT IS _COURT_.

    ANOTHER VIEW OF MAN, MY SECOND BRINGS;
      BEHOLD HIM THERE, THE MONARCH OF THE SEAS!

THAT IS _SHIP_;--PLAIN AS IT CAN BE.--NOW FOR THE CREAM.

    BUT AH! UNITED, (_COURTSHIP_, YOU KNOW,) WHAT REVERSE WE HAVE!
      MAN'S BOASTED POWER AND FREEDOM, ALL ARE FLOWN.
    LORD OF THE EARTH AND SEA, HE BENDS A SLAVE,
      AND WOMAN, LOVELY WOMAN, REIGNS ALONE.

A VERY PROPER COMPLIMENT!--AND THEN FOLLOWS THE APPLICATION,
WHICH I THINK, MY DEAR HARRIET, YOU CANNOT FIND MUCH DIFFICULTY
IN COMPREHENDING.  READ IT IN COMFORT TO YOURSELF.  THERE CAN
BE NO DOUBT OF ITS BEING WRITTEN FOR YOU AND TO YOU."

HARRIET COULD NOT LONG RESIST SO DELIGHTFUL A PERSUASION.
SHE READ THE CONCLUDING LINES, AND WAS ALL FLUTTER AND HAPPINESS.
SHE COULD NOT SPEAK.  BUT SHE WAS NOT WANTED TO SPEAK.  IT WAS ENOUGH
FOR HER TO FEEL.  EMMA SPOKE FOR HER.

"THERE IS SO POINTED, AND SO PARTICULAR A MEANING IN THIS COMPLIMENT,"
SAID SHE, "THAT I CANNOT HAVE A DOUBT AS TO MR. ELTON'S INTENTIONS.
YOU ARE HIS OBJECT--AND YOU WILL SOON RECEIVE THE COMPLETEST PROOF
OF IT.  I THOUGHT IT MUST BE SO.  I THOUGHT I COULD NOT BE SO DECEIVED;
BUT NOW, IT IS CLEAR; THE STATE OF HIS MIND IS AS CLEAR AND DECIDED,
AS MY WISHES ON THE SUBJECT HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE I KNEW YOU.
YES, HARRIET, JUST SO LONG HAVE I BEEN WANTING THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE
TO HAPPEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  I COULD NEVER TELL WHETHER AN ATTACHMENT
BETWEEN YOU AND MR. ELTON WERE MOST DESIRABLE OR MOST NATURAL.
ITS PROBABILITY AND ITS ELIGIBILITY HAVE REALLY SO EQUALLED EACH
OTHER! I AM VERY HAPPY.  I CONGRATULATE YOU, MY DEAR HARRIET, WITH ALL
MY HEART.  THIS IS AN ATTACHMENT WHICH A WOMAN MAY WELL FEEL PRIDE
IN CREATING.  THIS IS A CONNEXION WHICH OFFERS NOTHING BUT GOOD.
IT WILL GIVE YOU EVERY THING THAT YOU WANT--CONSIDERATION, INDEPENDENCE,
A PROPER HOME--IT WILL FIX YOU IN THE CENTRE OF ALL YOUR REAL FRIENDS,
CLOSE TO HARTFIELD AND TO ME, AND CONFIRM OUR INTIMACY FOR EVER.
THIS, HARRIET, IS AN ALLIANCE WHICH CAN NEVER RAISE A BLUSH IN EITHER
OF US."

"DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE!"--AND "DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE," WAS ALL THAT HARRIET,
WITH MANY TENDER EMBRACES COULD ARTICULATE AT FIRST; BUT WHEN THEY
DID ARRIVE AT SOMETHING MORE LIKE CONVERSATION, IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY
CLEAR TO HER FRIEND THAT SHE SAW, FELT, ANTICIPATED, AND REMEMBERED
JUST AS SHE OUGHT.  MR. ELTON'S SUPERIORITY HAD VERY AMPLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

"WHATEVER YOU SAY IS ALWAYS RIGHT," CRIED HARRIET, "AND THEREFORE
I SUPPOSE, AND BELIEVE, AND HOPE IT MUST BE SO; BUT OTHERWISE I COULD
NOT HAVE IMAGINED IT.  IT IS SO MUCH BEYOND ANY THING I DESERVE.
MR. ELTON, WHO MIGHT MARRY ANY BODY! THERE CANNOT BE TWO OPINIONS
ABOUT _HIM_.  HE IS SO VERY SUPERIOR.  ONLY THINK OF THOSE SWEET
VERSES--`TO MISS --------.' DEAR ME, HOW CLEVER!--COULD IT REALLY
BE MEANT FOR ME?"

"I CANNOT MAKE A QUESTION, OR LISTEN TO A QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
IT IS A CERTAINTY.  RECEIVE IT ON MY JUDGMENT.  IT IS A SORT
OF PROLOGUE TO THE PLAY, A MOTTO TO THE CHAPTER; AND WILL BE SOON
FOLLOWED BY MATTER-OF-FACT PROSE."

"IT IS A SORT OF THING WHICH NOBODY COULD HAVE EXPECTED.  I AM SURE,
A MONTH AGO, I HAD NO MORE IDEA MYSELF!--THE STRANGEST THINGS DO
TAKE PLACE!"

"WHEN MISS SMITHS AND MR. ELTONS GET ACQUAINTED--THEY DO INDEED--AND
REALLY IT IS STRANGE; IT IS OUT OF THE COMMON COURSE THAT WHAT IS
SO EVIDENTLY, SO PALPABLY DESIRABLE--WHAT COURTS THE PRE-ARRANGEMENT
OF OTHER PEOPLE, SHOULD SO IMMEDIATELY SHAPE ITSELF INTO THE PROPER FORM.
YOU AND MR. ELTON ARE BY SITUATION CALLED TOGETHER; YOU BELONG
TO ONE ANOTHER BY EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF YOUR RESPECTIVE HOMES.
YOUR MARRYING WILL BE EQUAL TO THE MATCH AT RANDALLS.  THERE DOES
SEEM TO BE A SOMETHING IN THE AIR OF HARTFIELD WHICH GIVES LOVE
EXACTLY THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND SENDS IT INTO THE VERY CHANNEL
WHERE IT OUGHT TO FLOW.

      THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE NEVER DID RUN SMOOTH--

A HARTFIELD EDITION OF SHAKESPEARE WOULD HAVE A LONG NOTE ON THAT PASSAGE."

"THAT MR. ELTON SHOULD REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH ME,--ME, OF ALL PEOPLE,
WHO DID NOT KNOW HIM, TO SPEAK TO HIM, AT MICHAELMAS! AND HE,
THE VERY HANDSOMEST MAN THAT EVER WAS, AND A MAN THAT EVERY BODY
LOOKS UP TO, QUITE LIKE MR. KNIGHTLEY! HIS COMPANY SO SOUGHT AFTER,
THAT EVERY BODY SAYS HE NEED NOT EAT A SINGLE MEAL BY HIMSELF IF HE
DOES NOT CHUSE IT; THAT HE HAS MORE INVITATIONS THAN THERE ARE DAYS
IN THE WEEK.  AND SO EXCELLENT IN THE CHURCH! MISS NASH HAS PUT DOWN
ALL THE TEXTS HE HAS EVER PREACHED FROM SINCE HE CAME TO HIGHBURY.
DEAR ME! WHEN I LOOK BACK TO THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM! HOW LITTLE
DID I THINK!--THE TWO ABBOTS AND I RAN INTO THE FRONT ROOM AND
PEEPED THROUGH THE BLIND WHEN WE HEARD HE WAS GOING BY, AND MISS
NASH CAME AND SCOLDED US AWAY, AND STAID TO LOOK THROUGH HERSELF;
HOWEVER, SHE CALLED ME BACK PRESENTLY, AND LET ME LOOK TOO,
WHICH WAS VERY GOOD-NATURED. AND HOW BEAUTIFUL WE THOUGHT HE LOOKED!
HE WAS ARM-IN-ARM WITH MR. COLE."

"THIS IS AN ALLIANCE WHICH, WHOEVER--WHATEVER YOUR FRIENDS MAY BE,
MUST BE AGREEABLE TO THEM, PROVIDED AT LEAST THEY HAVE COMMON SENSE;
AND WE ARE NOT TO BE ADDRESSING OUR CONDUCT TO FOOLS.  IF THEY
ARE ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU _HAPPILY_ MARRIED, HERE IS A MAN WHOSE AMIABLE
CHARACTER GIVES EVERY ASSURANCE OF IT;--IF THEY WISH TO HAVE YOU
SETTLED IN THE SAME COUNTRY AND CIRCLE WHICH THEY HAVE CHOSEN
TO PLACE YOU IN, HERE IT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED; AND IF THEIR ONLY
OBJECT IS THAT YOU SHOULD, IN THE COMMON PHRASE, BE _WELL_ MARRIED,
HERE IS THE COMFORTABLE FORTUNE, THE RESPECTABLE ESTABLISHMENT,
THE RISE IN THE WORLD WHICH MUST SATISFY THEM."

"YES, VERY TRUE.  HOW NICELY YOU TALK; I LOVE TO HEAR YOU.
YOU UNDERSTAND EVERY THING.  YOU AND MR. ELTON ARE ONE AS CLEVER
AS THE OTHER.  THIS CHARADE!--IF I HAD STUDIED A TWELVEMONTH,
I COULD NEVER HAVE MADE ANY THING LIKE IT."

"I THOUGHT HE MEANT TO TRY HIS SKILL, BY HIS MANNER OF DECLINING
IT YESTERDAY."

"I DO THINK IT IS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE BEST CHARADE I EVER READ."

"I NEVER READ ONE MORE TO THE PURPOSE, CERTAINLY."

"IT IS AS LONG AGAIN AS ALMOST ALL WE HAVE HAD BEFORE."

"I DO NOT CONSIDER ITS LENGTH AS PARTICULARLY IN ITS FAVOUR.
SUCH THINGS IN GENERAL CANNOT BE TOO SHORT."

HARRIET WAS TOO INTENT ON THE LINES TO HEAR.  THE MOST SATISFACTORY
COMPARISONS WERE RISING IN HER MIND.

"IT IS ONE THING," SAID SHE, PRESENTLY--HER CHEEKS IN A GLOW--"TO
HAVE VERY GOOD SENSE IN A COMMON WAY, LIKE EVERY BODY ELSE,
AND IF THERE IS ANY THING TO SAY, TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER,
AND SAY JUST WHAT YOU MUST, IN A SHORT WAY; AND ANOTHER, TO WRITE
VERSES AND CHARADES LIKE THIS."

EMMA COULD NOT HAVE DESIRED A MORE SPIRITED REJECTION OF MR. MARTIN'S PROSE.

"SUCH SWEET LINES!" CONTINUED HARRIET--"THESE TWO LAST!--BUT
HOW SHALL I EVER BE ABLE TO RETURN THE PAPER, OR SAY I HAVE FOUND
IT OUT?--OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT?"

"LEAVE IT TO ME.  YOU DO NOTHING.  HE WILL BE HERE THIS EVENING,
I DARE SAY, AND THEN I WILL GIVE IT HIM BACK, AND SOME NONSENSE
OR OTHER WILL PASS BETWEEN US, AND YOU SHALL NOT BE COMMITTED.--YOUR
SOFT EYES SHALL CHUSE THEIR OWN TIME FOR BEAMING.  TRUST TO ME."

"OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, WHAT A PITY THAT I MUST NOT WRITE THIS BEAUTIFUL
CHARADE INTO MY BOOK! I AM SURE I HAVE NOT GOT ONE HALF SO GOOD."

"LEAVE OUT THE TWO LAST LINES, AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOU
SHOULD NOT WRITE IT INTO YOUR BOOK."

"OH! BUT THOSE TWO LINES ARE"--

--"THE BEST OF ALL.  GRANTED;--FOR PRIVATE ENJOYMENT; AND FOR PRIVATE
ENJOYMENT KEEP THEM.  THEY ARE NOT AT ALL THE LESS WRITTEN YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE YOU DIVIDE THEM.  THE COUPLET DOES NOT CEASE TO BE, NOR DOES
ITS MEANING CHANGE.  BUT TAKE IT AWAY, AND ALL _APPROPRIATION_ CEASES,
AND A VERY PRETTY GALLANT CHARADE REMAINS, FIT FOR ANY COLLECTION.
DEPEND UPON IT, HE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE HIS CHARADE SLIGHTED,
MUCH BETTER THAN HIS PASSION.  A POET IN LOVE MUST BE ENCOURAGED IN
BOTH CAPACITIES, OR NEITHER.  GIVE ME THE BOOK, I WILL WRITE IT DOWN,
AND THEN THERE CAN BE NO POSSIBLE REFLECTION ON YOU."

HARRIET SUBMITTED, THOUGH HER MIND COULD HARDLY SEPARATE THE PARTS,
SO AS TO FEEL QUITE SURE THAT HER FRIEND WERE NOT WRITING DOWN
A DECLARATION OF LOVE.  IT SEEMED TOO PRECIOUS AN OFFERING FOR ANY
DEGREE OF PUBLICITY.

"I SHALL NEVER LET THAT BOOK GO OUT OF MY OWN HANDS," SAID SHE.

"VERY WELL," REPLIED EMMA; "A MOST NATURAL FEELING; AND THE LONGER
IT LASTS, THE BETTER I SHALL BE PLEASED.  BUT HERE IS MY FATHER
COMING: YOU WILL NOT OBJECT TO MY READING THE CHARADE TO HIM.
IT WILL BE GIVING HIM SO MUCH PLEASURE! HE LOVES ANY THING OF
THE SORT, AND ESPECIALLY ANY THING THAT PAYS WOMAN A COMPLIMENT.
HE HAS THE TENDEREST SPIRIT OF GALLANTRY TOWARDS US ALL!--YOU MUST
LET ME READ IT TO HIM."

HARRIET LOOKED GRAVE.

"MY DEAR HARRIET, YOU MUST NOT REFINE TOO MUCH UPON THIS
CHARADE.--YOU WILL BETRAY YOUR FEELINGS IMPROPERLY, IF YOU ARE
TOO CONSCIOUS AND TOO QUICK, AND APPEAR TO AFFIX MORE MEANING,
OR EVEN QUITE ALL THE MEANING WHICH MAY BE AFFIXED TO IT.
DO NOT BE OVERPOWERED BY SUCH A LITTLE TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION.
IF HE HAD BEEN ANXIOUS FOR SECRECY, HE WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT THE PAPER
WHILE I WAS BY; BUT HE RATHER PUSHED IT TOWARDS ME THAN TOWARDS YOU.
DO NOT LET US BE TOO SOLEMN ON THE BUSINESS.  HE HAS ENCOURAGEMENT
ENOUGH TO PROCEED, WITHOUT OUR SIGHING OUT OUR SOULS OVER THIS CHARADE."

"OH! NO--I HOPE I SHALL NOT BE RIDICULOUS ABOUT IT.  DO AS YOU PLEASE."

MR. WOODHOUSE CAME IN, AND VERY SOON LED TO THE SUBJECT AGAIN,
BY THE RECURRENCE OF HIS VERY FREQUENT INQUIRY OF "WELL, MY DEARS,
HOW DOES YOUR BOOK GO ON?--HAVE YOU GOT ANY THING FRESH?"

"YES, PAPA; WE HAVE SOMETHING TO READ YOU, SOMETHING QUITE FRESH.
A PIECE OF PAPER WAS FOUND ON THE TABLE THIS MORNING--(DROPT,
WE SUPPOSE, BY A FAIRY)--CONTAINING A VERY PRETTY CHARADE, AND WE
HAVE JUST COPIED IT IN."

SHE READ IT TO HIM, JUST AS HE LIKED TO HAVE ANY THING READ,
SLOWLY AND DISTINCTLY, AND TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER, WITH EXPLANATIONS
OF EVERY PART AS SHE PROCEEDED--AND HE WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED, AND,
AS SHE HAD FORESEEN, ESPECIALLY STRUCK WITH THE COMPLIMENTARY CONCLUSION.

"AYE, THAT'S VERY JUST, INDEED, THAT'S VERY PROPERLY SAID.
VERY TRUE.  `WOMAN, LOVELY WOMAN.' IT IS SUCH A PRETTY CHARADE,
MY DEAR, THAT I CAN EASILY GUESS WHAT FAIRY BROUGHT IT.--NOBODY
COULD HAVE WRITTEN SO PRETTILY, BUT YOU, EMMA."

EMMA ONLY NODDED, AND SMILED.--AFTER A LITTLE THINKING,
AND A VERY TENDER SIGH, HE ADDED,

"AH! IT IS NO DIFFICULTY TO SEE WHO YOU TAKE AFTER! YOUR DEAR MOTHER
WAS SO CLEVER AT ALL THOSE THINGS! IF I HAD BUT HER MEMORY! BUT I
CAN REMEMBER NOTHING;--NOT EVEN THAT PARTICULAR RIDDLE WHICH YOU
HAVE HEARD ME MENTION; I CAN ONLY RECOLLECT THE FIRST STANZA;
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL.

    KITTY, A FAIR BUT FROZEN MAID,
      KINDLED A FLAME I YET DEPLORE,
    THE HOOD-WINK'D BOY I CALLED TO AID,
    THOUGH OF HIS NEAR APPROACH AFRAID,
      SO FATAL TO MY SUIT BEFORE.

AND THAT IS ALL THAT I CAN RECOLLECT OF IT--BUT IT IS VERY CLEVER
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  BUT I THINK, MY DEAR, YOU SAID YOU HAD GOT IT."

"YES, PAPA, IT IS WRITTEN OUT IN OUR SECOND PAGE.  WE COPIED IT
FROM THE ELEGANT EXTRACTS.  IT WAS GARRICK'S, YOU KNOW."

"AYE, VERY TRUE.--I WISH I COULD RECOLLECT MORE OF IT.

    KITTY, A FAIR BUT FROZEN MAID.

THE NAME MAKES ME THINK OF POOR ISABELLA; FOR SHE WAS VERY NEAR
BEING CHRISTENED CATHERINE AFTER HER GRANDMAMA.  I HOPE WE SHALL
HAVE HER HERE NEXT WEEK.  HAVE YOU THOUGHT, MY DEAR, WHERE YOU
SHALL PUT HER--AND WHAT ROOM THERE WILL BE FOR THE CHILDREN?"

"OH! YES--SHE WILL HAVE HER OWN ROOM, OF COURSE; THE ROOM SHE ALWAYS
HAS;--AND THERE IS THE NURSERY FOR THE CHILDREN,--JUST AS USUAL,
YOU KNOW.  WHY SHOULD THERE BE ANY CHANGE?"

"I DO NOT KNOW, MY DEAR--BUT IT IS SO LONG SINCE SHE WAS HERE!--NOT
SINCE LAST EASTER, AND THEN ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS.--MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY'S
BEING A LAWYER IS VERY INCONVENIENT.--POOR ISABELLA!--SHE IS SADLY
TAKEN AWAY FROM US ALL!--AND HOW SORRY SHE WILL BE WHEN SHE COMES,
NOT TO SEE MISS TAYLOR HERE!"

"SHE WILL NOT BE SURPRIZED, PAPA, AT LEAST."

"I DO NOT KNOW, MY DEAR.  I AM SURE I WAS VERY MUCH SURPRIZED
WHEN I FIRST HEARD SHE WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED."

"WE MUST ASK MR. AND MRS. WESTON TO DINE WITH US, WHILE ISABELLA
IS HERE."

"YES, MY DEAR, IF THERE IS TIME.--BUT--(IN A VERY DEPRESSED TONE)--SHE
IS COMING FOR ONLY ONE WEEK.  THERE WILL NOT BE TIME FOR ANY THING."

"IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY CANNOT STAY LONGER--BUT IT SEEMS A CASE
OF NECESSITY.  MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY MUST BE IN TOWN AGAIN ON THE 28TH,
AND WE OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL, PAPA, THAT WE ARE TO HAVE THE WHOLE
OF THE TIME THEY CAN GIVE TO THE COUNTRY, THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS
ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN OUT FOR THE ABBEY.  MR. KNIGHTLEY PROMISES
TO GIVE UP HIS CLAIM THIS CHRISTMAS--THOUGH YOU KNOW IT IS LONGER
SINCE THEY WERE WITH HIM, THAN WITH US."

"IT WOULD BE VERY HARD, INDEED, MY DEAR, IF POOR ISABELLA WERE
TO BE ANYWHERE BUT AT HARTFIELD."

MR. WOODHOUSE COULD NEVER ALLOW FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY'S CLAIMS ON
HIS BROTHER, OR ANY BODY'S CLAIMS ON ISABELLA, EXCEPT HIS OWN.
HE SAT MUSING A LITTLE WHILE, AND THEN SAID,

"BUT I DO NOT SEE WHY POOR ISABELLA SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO GO BACK
SO SOON, THOUGH HE DOES.  I THINK, EMMA, I SHALL TRY AND PERSUADE
HER TO STAY LONGER WITH US.  SHE AND THE CHILDREN MIGHT STAY VERY WELL."

"AH! PAPA--THAT IS WHAT YOU NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH,
AND I DO NOT THINK YOU EVER WILL.  ISABELLA CANNOT BEAR TO STAY
BEHIND HER HUSBAND."

THIS WAS TOO TRUE FOR CONTRADICTION.  UNWELCOME AS IT WAS, MR. WOODHOUSE
COULD ONLY GIVE A SUBMISSIVE SIGH; AND AS EMMA SAW HIS SPIRITS
AFFECTED BY THE IDEA OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ATTACHMENT TO HER HUSBAND,
SHE IMMEDIATELY LED TO SUCH A BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT AS MUST RAISE THEM.

"HARRIET MUST GIVE US AS MUCH OF HER COMPANY AS SHE CAN WHILE
MY BROTHER AND SISTER ARE HERE.  I AM SURE SHE WILL BE PLEASED
WITH THE CHILDREN.  WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE CHILDREN, ARE NOT WE,
PAPA? I WONDER WHICH SHE WILL THINK THE HANDSOMEST, HENRY OR JOHN?"

"AYE, I WONDER WHICH SHE WILL.  POOR LITTLE DEARS, HOW GLAD THEY
WILL BE TO COME.  THEY ARE VERY FOND OF BEING AT HARTFIELD, HARRIET."

"I DARE SAY THEY ARE, SIR.  I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW WHO IS NOT."

"HENRY IS A FINE BOY, BUT JOHN IS VERY LIKE HIS MAMA.  HENRY IS THE ELDEST,
HE WAS NAMED AFTER ME, NOT AFTER HIS FATHER.  JOHN, THE SECOND,
IS NAMED AFTER HIS FATHER.  SOME PEOPLE ARE SURPRIZED, I BELIEVE,
THAT THE ELDEST WAS NOT, BUT ISABELLA WOULD HAVE HIM CALLED HENRY,
WHICH I THOUGHT VERY PRETTY OF HER.  AND HE IS A VERY CLEVER BOY,
INDEED.  THEY ARE ALL REMARKABLY CLEVER; AND THEY HAVE SO MANY
PRETTY WAYS.  THEY WILL COME AND STAND BY MY CHAIR, AND SAY,
`GRANDPAPA, CAN YOU GIVE ME A BIT OF STRING?' AND ONCE HENRY ASKED ME
FOR A KNIFE, BUT I TOLD HIM KNIVES WERE ONLY MADE FOR GRANDPAPAS.
I THINK THEIR FATHER IS TOO ROUGH WITH THEM VERY OFTEN."

"HE APPEARS ROUGH TO YOU," SAID EMMA, "BECAUSE YOU ARE SO VERY
GENTLE YOURSELF; BUT IF YOU COULD COMPARE HIM WITH OTHER PAPAS,
YOU WOULD NOT THINK HIM ROUGH.  HE WISHES HIS BOYS TO BE ACTIVE AND HARDY;
AND IF THEY MISBEHAVE, CAN GIVE THEM A SHARP WORD NOW AND THEN;
BUT HE IS AN AFFECTIONATE FATHER--CERTAINLY MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY
IS AN AFFECTIONATE FATHER.  THE CHILDREN ARE ALL FOND OF HIM."

"AND THEN THEIR UNCLE COMES IN, AND TOSSES THEM UP TO THE CEILING
IN A VERY FRIGHTFUL WAY!"

"BUT THEY LIKE IT, PAPA; THERE IS NOTHING THEY LIKE SO MUCH.
IT IS SUCH ENJOYMENT TO THEM, THAT IF THEIR UNCLE DID NOT LAY DOWN
THE RULE OF THEIR TAKING TURNS, WHICHEVER BEGAN WOULD NEVER GIVE WAY
TO THE OTHER."

"WELL, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT."

"THAT IS THE CASE WITH US ALL, PAPA.  ONE HALF OF THE WORLD CANNOT
UNDERSTAND THE PLEASURES OF THE OTHER."

LATER IN THE MORNING, AND JUST AS THE GIRLS WERE GOING TO SEPARATE
IN PREPARATION FOR THE REGULAR FOUR O'CLOCK DINNER, THE HERO
OF THIS INIMITABLE CHARADE WALKED IN AGAIN.  HARRIET TURNED AWAY;
BUT EMMA COULD RECEIVE HIM WITH THE USUAL SMILE, AND HER QUICK EYE
SOON DISCERNED IN HIS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING MADE A PUSH--OF
HAVING THROWN A DIE; AND SHE IMAGINED HE WAS COME TO SEE HOW IT
MIGHT TURN UP.  HIS OSTENSIBLE REASON, HOWEVER, WAS TO ASK WHETHER
MR. WOODHOUSE'S PARTY COULD BE MADE UP IN THE EVENING WITHOUT HIM,
OR WHETHER HE SHOULD BE IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE NECESSARY AT HARTFIELD.
IF HE WERE, EVERY THING ELSE MUST GIVE WAY; BUT OTHERWISE HIS FRIEND
COLE HAD BEEN SAYING SO MUCH ABOUT HIS DINING WITH HIM--HAD MADE
SUCH A POINT OF IT, THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIM CONDITIONALLY TO COME.

EMMA THANKED HIM, BUT COULD NOT ALLOW OF HIS DISAPPOINTING HIS
FRIEND ON THEIR ACCOUNT; HER FATHER WAS SURE OF HIS RUBBER.
HE RE-URGED--SHE RE-DECLINED; AND HE SEEMED THEN ABOUT TO MAKE
HIS BOW, WHEN TAKING THE PAPER FROM THE TABLE, SHE RETURNED IT--

"OH! HERE IS THE CHARADE YOU WERE SO OBLIGING AS TO LEAVE WITH US;
THANK YOU FOR THE SIGHT OF IT.  WE ADMIRED IT SO MUCH, THAT I HAVE
VENTURED TO WRITE IT INTO MISS SMITH'S COLLECTION.  YOUR FRIEND
WILL NOT TAKE IT AMISS I HOPE.  OF COURSE I HAVE NOT TRANSCRIBED
BEYOND THE FIRST EIGHT LINES."

MR. ELTON CERTAINLY DID NOT VERY WELL KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
HE LOOKED RATHER DOUBTINGLY--RATHER CONFUSED; SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
"HONOUR,"--GLANCED AT EMMA AND AT HARRIET, AND THEN SEEING THE BOOK
OPEN ON THE TABLE, TOOK IT UP, AND EXAMINED IT VERY ATTENTIVELY.
WITH THE VIEW OF PASSING OFF AN AWKWARD MOMENT, EMMA SMILINGLY SAID,

"YOU MUST MAKE MY APOLOGIES TO YOUR FRIEND; BUT SO GOOD A CHARADE
MUST NOT BE CONFINED TO ONE OR TWO.  HE MAY BE SURE OF EVERY WOMAN'S
APPROBATION WHILE HE WRITES WITH SUCH GALLANTRY."

"I HAVE NO HESITATION IN SAYING," REPLIED MR. ELTON, THOUGH HESITATING
A GOOD DEAL WHILE HE SPOKE; "I HAVE NO HESITATION IN SAYING--AT
LEAST IF MY FRIEND FEELS AT ALL AS _I_ DO--I HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST
DOUBT THAT, COULD HE SEE HIS LITTLE EFFUSION HONOURED AS _I_ SEE IT,
(LOOKING AT THE BOOK AGAIN, AND REPLACING IT ON THE TABLE), HE
WOULD CONSIDER IT AS THE PROUDEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE."

AFTER THIS SPEECH HE WAS GONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  EMMA COULD NOT
THINK IT TOO SOON; FOR WITH ALL HIS GOOD AND AGREEABLE QUALITIES,
THERE WAS A SORT OF PARADE IN HIS SPEECHES WHICH WAS VERY APT
TO INCLINE HER TO LAUGH.  SHE RAN AWAY TO INDULGE THE INCLINATION,
LEAVING THE TENDER AND THE SUBLIME OF PLEASURE TO HARRIET'S SHARE.



CHAPTER X


THOUGH NOW THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER, THERE HAD YET BEEN NO WEATHER
TO PREVENT THE YOUNG LADIES FROM TOLERABLY REGULAR EXERCISE;
AND ON THE MORROW, EMMA HAD A CHARITABLE VISIT TO PAY TO A POOR
SICK FAMILY, WHO LIVED A LITTLE WAY OUT OF HIGHBURY.

THEIR ROAD TO THIS DETACHED COTTAGE WAS DOWN VICARAGE LANE, A LANE
LEADING AT RIGHT ANGLES FROM THE BROAD, THOUGH IRREGULAR, MAIN STREET
OF THE PLACE; AND, AS MAY BE INFERRED, CONTAINING THE BLESSED ABODE
OF MR. ELTON.  A FEW INFERIOR DWELLINGS WERE FIRST TO BE PASSED,
AND THEN, ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE DOWN THE LANE ROSE THE VICARAGE,
AN OLD AND NOT VERY GOOD HOUSE, ALMOST AS CLOSE TO THE ROAD AS IT
COULD BE.  IT HAD NO ADVANTAGE OF SITUATION; BUT HAD BEEN VERY MUCH
SMARTENED UP BY THE PRESENT PROPRIETOR; AND, SUCH AS IT WAS,
THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF THE TWO FRIENDS PASSING IT WITHOUT
A SLACKENED PACE AND OBSERVING EYES.--EMMA'S REMARK WAS--

"THERE IT IS.  THERE GO YOU AND YOUR RIDDLE-BOOK ONE OF THESE DAYS."--
HARRIET'S WAS--

"OH, WHAT A SWEET HOUSE!--HOW VERY BEAUTIFUL!--THERE ARE THE YELLOW
CURTAINS THAT MISS NASH ADMIRES SO MUCH."

"I DO NOT OFTEN WALK THIS WAY _NOW_," SAID EMMA, AS THEY PROCEEDED,
"BUT _THEN_ THERE WILL BE AN INDUCEMENT, AND I SHALL GRADUALLY GET
INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE HEDGES, GATES, POOLS AND POLLARDS
OF THIS PART OF HIGHBURY."

HARRIET, SHE FOUND, HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE BEEN WITHIN SIDE THE VICARAGE,
AND HER CURIOSITY TO SEE IT WAS SO EXTREME, THAT, CONSIDERING EXTERIORS
AND PROBABILITIES, EMMA COULD ONLY CLASS IT, AS A PROOF OF LOVE,
WITH MR. ELTON'S SEEING READY WIT IN HER.

"I WISH WE COULD CONTRIVE IT," SAID SHE; "BUT I CANNOT THINK
OF ANY TOLERABLE PRETENCE FOR GOING IN;--NO SERVANT THAT I WANT
TO INQUIRE ABOUT OF HIS HOUSEKEEPER--NO MESSAGE FROM MY FATHER."

SHE PONDERED, BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING.  AFTER A MUTUAL SILENCE
OF SOME MINUTES, HARRIET THUS BEGAN AGAIN--

"I DO SO WONDER, MISS WOODHOUSE, THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE MARRIED,
OR GOING TO BE MARRIED! SO CHARMING AS YOU ARE!"--

EMMA LAUGHED, AND REPLIED,

"MY BEING CHARMING, HARRIET, IS NOT QUITE ENOUGH TO INDUCE ME TO MARRY;
I MUST FIND OTHER PEOPLE CHARMING--ONE OTHER PERSON AT LEAST.
AND I AM NOT ONLY, NOT GOING TO BE MARRIED, AT PRESENT, BUT HAVE
VERY LITTLE INTENTION OF EVER MARRYING AT ALL."

"AH!--SO YOU SAY; BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE IT."

"I MUST SEE SOMEBODY VERY SUPERIOR TO ANY ONE I HAVE SEEN YET,
TO BE TEMPTED; MR. ELTON, YOU KNOW, (RECOLLECTING HERSELF,)
IS OUT OF THE QUESTION:  AND I DO _NOT_ WISH TO SEE ANY SUCH PERSON.
I WOULD RATHER NOT BE TEMPTED.  I CANNOT REALLY CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.
IF I WERE TO MARRY, I MUST EXPECT TO REPENT IT."

"DEAR ME!--IT IS SO ODD TO HEAR A WOMAN TALK SO!"--

"I HAVE NONE OF THE USUAL INDUCEMENTS OF WOMEN TO MARRY.
WERE I TO FALL IN LOVE, INDEED, IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT THING!
BUT I NEVER HAVE BEEN IN LOVE; IT IS NOT MY WAY, OR MY NATURE;
AND I DO NOT THINK I EVER SHALL.  AND, WITHOUT LOVE, I AM SURE I
SHOULD BE A FOOL TO CHANGE SUCH A SITUATION AS MINE.  FORTUNE I
DO NOT WANT; EMPLOYMENT I DO NOT WANT; CONSEQUENCE I DO NOT WANT:
I BELIEVE FEW MARRIED WOMEN ARE HALF AS MUCH MISTRESS OF THEIR
HUSBAND'S HOUSE AS I AM OF HARTFIELD; AND NEVER, NEVER COULD I EXPECT
TO BE SO TRULY BELOVED AND IMPORTANT; SO ALWAYS FIRST AND ALWAYS
RIGHT IN ANY MAN'S EYES AS I AM IN MY FATHER'S."

"BUT THEN, TO BE AN OLD MAID AT LAST, LIKE MISS BATES!"

"THAT IS AS FORMIDABLE AN IMAGE AS YOU COULD PRESENT, HARRIET; AND IF I
THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER BE LIKE MISS BATES! SO SILLY--SO SATISFIED--
SO SMILING--SO PROSING--SO UNDISTINGUISHING AND UNFASTIDIOUS--
AND SO APT TO TELL EVERY THING RELATIVE TO EVERY BODY ABOUT ME,
I WOULD MARRY TO-MORROW. BUT BETWEEN _US_, I AM CONVINCED THERE NEVER
CAN BE ANY LIKENESS, EXCEPT IN BEING UNMARRIED."

"BUT STILL, YOU WILL BE AN OLD MAID! AND THAT'S SO DREADFUL!"

"NEVER MIND, HARRIET, I SHALL NOT BE A POOR OLD MAID; AND IT IS
POVERTY ONLY WHICH MAKES CELIBACY CONTEMPTIBLE TO A GENEROUS PUBLIC!
A SINGLE WOMAN, WITH A VERY NARROW INCOME, MUST BE A RIDICULOUS,
DISAGREEABLE OLD MAID! THE PROPER SPORT OF BOYS AND GIRLS,
BUT A SINGLE WOMAN, OF GOOD FORTUNE, IS ALWAYS RESPECTABLE,
AND MAY BE AS SENSIBLE AND PLEASANT AS ANY BODY ELSE.  AND THE
DISTINCTION IS NOT QUITE SO MUCH AGAINST THE CANDOUR AND COMMON
SENSE OF THE WORLD AS APPEARS AT FIRST; FOR A VERY NARROW INCOME
HAS A TENDENCY TO CONTRACT THE MIND, AND SOUR THE TEMPER.
THOSE WHO CAN BARELY LIVE, AND WHO LIVE PERFORCE IN A VERY SMALL,
AND GENERALLY VERY INFERIOR, SOCIETY, MAY WELL BE ILLIBERAL AND CROSS.
THIS DOES NOT APPLY, HOWEVER, TO MISS BATES; SHE IS ONLY TOO GOOD
NATURED AND TOO SILLY TO SUIT ME; BUT, IN GENERAL, SHE IS VERY
MUCH TO THE TASTE OF EVERY BODY, THOUGH SINGLE AND THOUGH POOR.
POVERTY CERTAINLY HAS NOT CONTRACTED HER MIND:  I REALLY BELIEVE,
IF SHE HAD ONLY A SHILLING IN THE WORLD, SHE WOULD BE VERY LIKELY
TO GIVE AWAY SIXPENCE OF IT; AND NOBODY IS AFRAID OF HER:  THAT IS A
GREAT CHARM."

"DEAR ME! BUT WHAT SHALL YOU DO? HOW SHALL YOU EMPLOY YOURSELF
WHEN YOU GROW OLD?"

"IF I KNOW MYSELF, HARRIET, MINE IS AN ACTIVE, BUSY MIND, WITH A GREAT
MANY INDEPENDENT RESOURCES; AND I DO NOT PERCEIVE WHY I SHOULD BE
MORE IN WANT OF EMPLOYMENT AT FORTY OR FIFTY THAN ONE-AND-TWENTY.
WOMAN'S USUAL OCCUPATIONS OF HAND AND MIND WILL BE AS OPEN TO ME THEN
AS THEY ARE NOW; OR WITH NO IMPORTANT VARIATION.  IF I DRAW LESS,
I SHALL READ MORE; IF I GIVE UP MUSIC, I SHALL TAKE TO CARPET-WORK.
AND AS FOR OBJECTS OF INTEREST, OBJECTS FOR THE AFFECTIONS,
WHICH IS IN TRUTH THE GREAT POINT OF INFERIORITY, THE WANT OF WHICH
IS REALLY THE GREAT EVIL TO BE AVOIDED IN _NOT_ MARRYING, I SHALL
BE VERY WELL OFF, WITH ALL THE CHILDREN OF A SISTER I LOVE SO MUCH,
TO CARE ABOUT.  THERE WILL BE ENOUGH OF THEM, IN ALL PROBABILITY,
TO SUPPLY EVERY SORT OF SENSATION THAT DECLINING LIFE CAN NEED.
THERE WILL BE ENOUGH FOR EVERY HOPE AND EVERY FEAR; AND THOUGH MY
ATTACHMENT TO NONE CAN EQUAL THAT OF A PARENT, IT SUITS MY IDEAS
OF COMFORT BETTER THAN WHAT IS WARMER AND BLINDER.  MY NEPHEWS
AND NIECES!--I SHALL OFTEN HAVE A NIECE WITH ME."

"DO YOU KNOW MISS BATES'S NIECE?  THAT IS, I KNOW YOU MUST HAVE
SEEN HER A HUNDRED TIMES--BUT ARE YOU ACQUAINTED?"

"OH! YES; WE ARE ALWAYS FORCED TO BE ACQUAINTED WHENEVER SHE COMES
TO HIGHBURY.  BY THE BYE, _THAT_ IS ALMOST ENOUGH TO PUT ONE OUT
OF CONCEIT WITH A NIECE.  HEAVEN FORBID! AT LEAST, THAT I SHOULD
EVER BORE PEOPLE HALF SO MUCH ABOUT ALL THE KNIGHTLEYS TOGETHER,
AS SHE DOES ABOUT JANE FAIRFAX.  ONE IS SICK OF THE VERY NAME
OF JANE FAIRFAX.  EVERY LETTER FROM HER IS READ FORTY TIMES OVER;
HER COMPLIMENTS TO ALL FRIENDS GO ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN; AND IF SHE
DOES BUT SEND HER AUNT THE PATTERN OF A STOMACHER, OR KNIT A PAIR
OF GARTERS FOR HER GRANDMOTHER, ONE HEARS OF NOTHING ELSE FOR A MONTH.
I WISH JANE FAIRFAX VERY WELL; BUT SHE TIRES ME TO DEATH."

THEY WERE NOW APPROACHING THE COTTAGE, AND ALL IDLE TOPICS
WERE SUPERSEDED.  EMMA WAS VERY COMPASSIONATE; AND THE DISTRESSES
OF THE POOR WERE AS SURE OF RELIEF FROM HER PERSONAL ATTENTION
AND KINDNESS, HER COUNSEL AND HER PATIENCE, AS FROM HER PURSE.
SHE UNDERSTOOD THEIR WAYS, COULD ALLOW FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND
THEIR TEMPTATIONS, HAD NO ROMANTIC EXPECTATIONS OF EXTRAORDINARY
VIRTUE FROM THOSE FOR WHOM EDUCATION HAD DONE SO LITTLE; ENTERED INTO
THEIR TROUBLES WITH READY SYMPATHY, AND ALWAYS GAVE HER ASSISTANCE
WITH AS MUCH INTELLIGENCE AS GOOD-WILL.  IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE,
IT WAS SICKNESS AND POVERTY TOGETHER WHICH SHE CAME TO VISIT;
AND AFTER REMAINING THERE AS LONG AS SHE COULD GIVE COMFORT OR ADVICE,
SHE QUITTED THE COTTAGE WITH SUCH AN IMPRESSION OF THE SCENE
AS MADE HER SAY TO HARRIET, AS THEY WALKED AWAY,

"THESE ARE THE SIGHTS, HARRIET, TO DO ONE GOOD.  HOW TRIFLING THEY
MAKE EVERY THING ELSE APPEAR!--I FEEL NOW AS IF I COULD THINK OF
NOTHING BUT THESE POOR CREATURES ALL THE REST OF THE DAY; AND YET,
WHO CAN SAY HOW SOON IT MAY ALL VANISH FROM MY MIND?"

"VERY TRUE," SAID HARRIET.  "POOR CREATURES! ONE CAN THINK
OF NOTHING ELSE."

"AND REALLY, I DO NOT THINK THE IMPRESSION WILL SOON BE OVER,"
SAID EMMA, AS SHE CROSSED THE LOW HEDGE, AND TOTTERING FOOTSTEP
WHICH ENDED THE NARROW, SLIPPERY PATH THROUGH THE COTTAGE GARDEN,
AND BROUGHT THEM INTO THE LANE AGAIN.  "I DO NOT THINK IT WILL,"
STOPPING TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT ALL THE OUTWARD WRETCHEDNESS OF THE PLACE,
AND RECALL THE STILL GREATER WITHIN.

"OH! DEAR, NO," SAID HER COMPANION.

THEY WALKED ON.  THE LANE MADE A SLIGHT BEND; AND WHEN THAT BEND
WAS PASSED, MR. ELTON WAS IMMEDIATELY IN SIGHT; AND SO NEAR
AS TO GIVE EMMA TIME ONLY TO SAY FARTHER,

"AH!  HARRIET, HERE COMES A VERY SUDDEN TRIAL OF OUR STABILITY
IN GOOD THOUGHTS.  WELL, (SMILING,) I HOPE IT MAY BE ALLOWED THAT
IF COMPASSION HAS PRODUCED EXERTION AND RELIEF TO THE SUFFERERS,
IT HAS DONE ALL THAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT.  IF WE FEEL FOR THE WRETCHED,
ENOUGH TO DO ALL WE CAN FOR THEM, THE REST IS EMPTY SYMPATHY,
ONLY DISTRESSING TO OURSELVES."

HARRIET COULD JUST ANSWER, "OH! DEAR, YES," BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN
JOINED THEM.  THE WANTS AND SUFFERINGS OF THE POOR FAMILY, HOWEVER,
WERE THE FIRST SUBJECT ON MEETING.  HE HAD BEEN GOING TO CALL
ON THEM.  HIS VISIT HE WOULD NOW DEFER; BUT THEY HAD A VERY
INTERESTING PARLEY ABOUT WHAT COULD BE DONE AND SHOULD BE DONE.
MR. ELTON THEN TURNED BACK TO ACCOMPANY THEM.

"TO FALL IN WITH EACH OTHER ON SUCH AN ERRAND AS THIS," THOUGHT EMMA;
"TO MEET IN A CHARITABLE SCHEME; THIS WILL BRING A GREAT INCREASE
OF LOVE ON EACH SIDE.  I SHOULD NOT WONDER IF IT WERE TO BRING
ON THE DECLARATION.  IT MUST, IF I WERE NOT HERE.  I WISH I WERE
ANYWHERE ELSE."

ANXIOUS TO SEPARATE HERSELF FROM THEM AS FAR AS SHE COULD, SHE SOON
AFTERWARDS TOOK POSSESSION OF A NARROW FOOTPATH, A LITTLE RAISED
ON ONE SIDE OF THE LANE, LEAVING THEM TOGETHER IN THE MAIN ROAD.
BUT SHE HAD NOT BEEN THERE TWO MINUTES WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HARRIET'S
HABITS OF DEPENDENCE AND IMITATION WERE BRINGING HER UP TOO, AND THAT,
IN SHORT, THEY WOULD BOTH BE SOON AFTER HER.  THIS WOULD NOT DO;
SHE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED, UNDER PRETENCE OF HAVING SOME ALTERATION
TO MAKE IN THE LACING OF HER HALF-BOOT, AND STOOPING DOWN IN COMPLETE
OCCUPATION OF THE FOOTPATH, BEGGED THEM TO HAVE THE GOODNESS TO WALK ON,
AND SHE WOULD FOLLOW IN HALF A MINUTE.  THEY DID AS THEY WERE DESIRED;
AND BY THE TIME SHE JUDGED IT REASONABLE TO HAVE DONE WITH HER BOOT,
SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF FARTHER DELAY IN HER POWER, BEING OVERTAKEN
BY A CHILD FROM THE COTTAGE, SETTING OUT, ACCORDING TO ORDERS,
WITH HER PITCHER, TO FETCH BROTH FROM HARTFIELD.  TO WALK BY THE SIDE
OF THIS CHILD, AND TALK TO AND QUESTION HER, WAS THE MOST NATURAL
THING IN THE WORLD, OR WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST NATURAL, HAD SHE BEEN
ACTING JUST THEN WITHOUT DESIGN; AND BY THIS MEANS THE OTHERS WERE
STILL ABLE TO KEEP AHEAD, WITHOUT ANY OBLIGATION OF WAITING FOR HER.
SHE GAINED ON THEM, HOWEVER, INVOLUNTARILY:  THE CHILD'S PACE WAS QUICK,
AND THEIRS RATHER SLOW; AND SHE WAS THE MORE CONCERNED AT IT,
FROM THEIR BEING EVIDENTLY IN A CONVERSATION WHICH INTERESTED THEM.
MR. ELTON WAS SPEAKING WITH ANIMATION, HARRIET LISTENING WITH A VERY
PLEASED ATTENTION; AND EMMA, HAVING SENT THE CHILD ON, WAS BEGINNING
TO THINK HOW SHE MIGHT DRAW BACK A LITTLE MORE, WHEN THEY BOTH
LOOKED AROUND, AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO JOIN THEM.

MR. ELTON WAS STILL TALKING, STILL ENGAGED IN SOME INTERESTING DETAIL;
AND EMMA EXPERIENCED SOME DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HE
WAS ONLY GIVING HIS FAIR COMPANION AN ACCOUNT OF THE YESTERDAY'S
PARTY AT HIS FRIEND COLE'S, AND THAT SHE WAS COME IN HERSELF FOR
THE STILTON CHEESE, THE NORTH WILTSHIRE, THE BUTTER, THE CELLERY,
THE BEET-ROOT, AND ALL THE DESSERT.

"THIS WOULD SOON HAVE LED TO SOMETHING BETTER, OF COURSE," WAS HER
CONSOLING REFLECTION; "ANY THING INTERESTS BETWEEN THOSE WHO LOVE;
AND ANY THING WILL SERVE AS INTRODUCTION TO WHAT IS NEAR THE HEART.
IF I COULD BUT HAVE KEPT LONGER AWAY!"

THEY NOW WALKED ON TOGETHER QUIETLY, TILL WITHIN VIEW OF THE VICARAGE
PALES, WHEN A SUDDEN RESOLUTION, OF AT LEAST GETTING HARRIET INTO
THE HOUSE, MADE HER AGAIN FIND SOMETHING VERY MUCH AMISS ABOUT HER BOOT,
AND FALL BEHIND TO ARRANGE IT ONCE MORE.  SHE THEN BROKE THE LACE
OFF SHORT, AND DEXTEROUSLY THROWING IT INTO A DITCH, WAS PRESENTLY
OBLIGED TO ENTREAT THEM TO STOP, AND ACKNOWLEDGED HER INABILITY TO
PUT HERSELF TO RIGHTS SO AS TO BE ABLE TO WALK HOME IN TOLERABLE COMFORT.

"PART OF MY LACE IS GONE," SAID SHE, "AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW I AM
TO CONTRIVE.  I REALLY AM A MOST TROUBLESOME COMPANION TO YOU BOTH,
BUT I HOPE I AM NOT OFTEN SO ILL-EQUIPPED. MR. ELTON, I MUST BEG
LEAVE TO STOP AT YOUR HOUSE, AND ASK YOUR HOUSEKEEPER FOR A BIT
OF RIBBAND OR STRING, OR ANY THING JUST TO KEEP MY BOOT ON."

MR. ELTON LOOKED ALL HAPPINESS AT THIS PROPOSITION; AND NOTHING
COULD EXCEED HIS ALERTNESS AND ATTENTION IN CONDUCTING THEM INTO
HIS HOUSE AND ENDEAVOURING TO MAKE EVERY THING APPEAR TO ADVANTAGE.
THE ROOM THEY WERE TAKEN INTO WAS THE ONE HE CHIEFLY OCCUPIED,
AND LOOKING FORWARDS; BEHIND IT WAS ANOTHER WITH WHICH IT IMMEDIATELY
COMMUNICATED; THE DOOR BETWEEN THEM WAS OPEN, AND EMMA PASSED
INTO IT WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER TO RECEIVE HER ASSISTANCE IN THE MOST
COMFORTABLE MANNER.  SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE THE DOOR AJAR AS SHE
FOUND IT; BUT SHE FULLY INTENDED THAT MR. ELTON SHOULD CLOSE IT.
IT WAS NOT CLOSED, HOWEVER, IT STILL REMAINED AJAR; BUT BY ENGAGING
THE HOUSEKEEPER IN INCESSANT CONVERSATION, SHE HOPED TO MAKE IT
PRACTICABLE FOR HIM TO CHUSE HIS OWN SUBJECT IN THE ADJOINING ROOM.
FOR TEN MINUTES SHE COULD HEAR NOTHING BUT HERSELF.  IT COULD
BE PROTRACTED NO LONGER.  SHE WAS THEN OBLIGED TO BE FINISHED,
AND MAKE HER APPEARANCE.

THE LOVERS WERE STANDING TOGETHER AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS.  IT HAD A
MOST FAVOURABLE ASPECT; AND, FOR HALF A MINUTE, EMMA FELT THE GLORY
OF HAVING SCHEMED SUCCESSFULLY.  BUT IT WOULD NOT DO; HE HAD NOT
COME TO THE POINT.  HE HAD BEEN MOST AGREEABLE, MOST DELIGHTFUL;
HE HAD TOLD HARRIET THAT HE HAD SEEN THEM GO BY, AND HAD PURPOSELY
FOLLOWED THEM; OTHER LITTLE GALLANTRIES AND ALLUSIONS HAD BEEN DROPT,
BUT NOTHING SERIOUS.

"CAUTIOUS, VERY CAUTIOUS," THOUGHT EMMA; "HE ADVANCES INCH BY INCH,
AND WILL HAZARD NOTHING TILL HE BELIEVES HIMSELF SECURE."

STILL, HOWEVER, THOUGH EVERY THING HAD NOT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
BY HER INGENIOUS DEVICE, SHE COULD NOT BUT FLATTER HERSELF
THAT IT HAD BEEN THE OCCASION OF MUCH PRESENT ENJOYMENT TO BOTH,
AND MUST BE LEADING THEM FORWARD TO THE GREAT EVENT.



CHAPTER XI


MR. ELTON MUST NOW BE LEFT TO HIMSELF.  IT WAS NO LONGER IN EMMA'S
POWER TO SUPERINTEND HIS HAPPINESS OR QUICKEN HIS MEASURES.
THE COMING OF HER SISTER'S FAMILY WAS SO VERY NEAR AT HAND,
THAT FIRST IN ANTICIPATION, AND THEN IN REALITY, IT BECAME HENCEFORTH
HER PRIME OBJECT OF INTEREST; AND DURING THE TEN DAYS OF THEIR STAY
AT HARTFIELD IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED--SHE DID NOT HERSELF EXPECT--
THAT ANY THING BEYOND OCCASIONAL, FORTUITOUS ASSISTANCE COULD
BE AFFORDED BY HER TO THE LOVERS.  THEY MIGHT ADVANCE RAPIDLY
IF THEY WOULD, HOWEVER; THEY MUST ADVANCE SOMEHOW OR OTHER WHETHER
THEY WOULD OR NO.  SHE HARDLY WISHED TO HAVE MORE LEISURE FOR THEM.
THERE ARE PEOPLE, WHO THE MORE YOU DO FOR THEM, THE LESS THEY WILL
DO FOR THEMSELVES.

MR. AND MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY, FROM HAVING BEEN LONGER THAN USUAL
ABSENT FROM SURRY, WERE EXCITING OF COURSE RATHER MORE THAN THE
USUAL INTEREST.  TILL THIS YEAR, EVERY LONG VACATION SINCE THEIR
MARRIAGE HAD BEEN DIVIDED BETWEEN HARTFIELD AND DONWELL ABBEY;
BUT ALL THE HOLIDAYS OF THIS AUTUMN HAD BEEN GIVEN TO SEA-BATHING
FOR THE CHILDREN, AND IT WAS THEREFORE MANY MONTHS SINCE THEY HAD
BEEN SEEN IN A REGULAR WAY BY THEIR SURRY CONNEXIONS, OR SEEN AT ALL
BY MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO COULD NOT BE INDUCED TO GET SO FAR AS LONDON,
EVEN FOR POOR ISABELLA'S SAKE; AND WHO CONSEQUENTLY WAS NOW MOST
NERVOUSLY AND APPREHENSIVELY HAPPY IN FORESTALLING THIS TOO SHORT VISIT.

HE THOUGHT MUCH OF THE EVILS OF THE JOURNEY FOR HER, AND NOT A
LITTLE OF THE FATIGUES OF HIS OWN HORSES AND COACHMAN WHO WERE TO
BRING SOME OF THE PARTY THE LAST HALF OF THE WAY; BUT HIS ALARMS
WERE NEEDLESS; THE SIXTEEN MILES BEING HAPPILY ACCOMPLISHED,
AND MR. AND MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY, THEIR FIVE CHILDREN, AND A COMPETENT
NUMBER OF NURSERY-MAIDS, ALL REACHING HARTFIELD IN SAFETY.
THE BUSTLE AND JOY OF SUCH AN ARRIVAL, THE MANY TO BE TALKED TO,
WELCOMED, ENCOURAGED, AND VARIOUSLY DISPERSED AND DISPOSED OF,
PRODUCED A NOISE AND CONFUSION WHICH HIS NERVES COULD NOT HAVE BORNE
UNDER ANY OTHER CAUSE, NOR HAVE ENDURED MUCH LONGER EVEN FOR THIS;
BUT THE WAYS OF HARTFIELD AND THE FEELINGS OF HER FATHER WERE
SO RESPECTED BY MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY, THAT IN SPITE OF MATERNAL
SOLICITUDE FOR THE IMMEDIATE ENJOYMENT OF HER LITTLE ONES,
AND FOR THEIR HAVING INSTANTLY ALL THE LIBERTY AND ATTENDANCE,
ALL THE EATING AND DRINKING, AND SLEEPING AND PLAYING,
WHICH THEY COULD POSSIBLY WISH FOR, WITHOUT THE SMALLEST DELAY,
THE CHILDREN WERE NEVER ALLOWED TO BE LONG A DISTURBANCE TO HIM,
EITHER IN THEMSELVES OR IN ANY RESTLESS ATTENDANCE ON THEM.

MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WAS A PRETTY, ELEGANT LITTLE WOMAN, OF GENTLE,
QUIET MANNERS, AND A DISPOSITION REMARKABLY AMIABLE AND AFFECTIONATE;
WRAPT UP IN HER FAMILY; A DEVOTED WIFE, A DOATING MOTHER,
AND SO TENDERLY ATTACHED TO HER FATHER AND SISTER THAT, BUT FOR
THESE HIGHER TIES, A WARMER LOVE MIGHT HAVE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE.
SHE COULD NEVER SEE A FAULT IN ANY OF THEM.  SHE WAS NOT A WOMAN
OF STRONG UNDERSTANDING OR ANY QUICKNESS; AND WITH THIS RESEMBLANCE
OF HER FATHER, SHE INHERITED ALSO MUCH OF HIS CONSTITUTION;
WAS DELICATE IN HER OWN HEALTH, OVER-CAREFUL OF THAT OF HER CHILDREN,
HAD MANY FEARS AND MANY NERVES, AND WAS AS FOND OF HER OWN MR. WINGFIELD
IN TOWN AS HER FATHER COULD BE OF MR. PERRY.  THEY WERE ALIKE TOO,
IN A GENERAL BENEVOLENCE OF TEMPER, AND A STRONG HABIT OF REGARD
FOR EVERY OLD ACQUAINTANCE.

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WAS A TALL, GENTLEMAN-LIKE, AND VERY CLEVER MAN;
RISING IN HIS PROFESSION, DOMESTIC, AND RESPECTABLE IN HIS
PRIVATE CHARACTER; BUT WITH RESERVED MANNERS WHICH PREVENTED HIS BEING
GENERALLY PLEASING; AND CAPABLE OF BEING SOMETIMES OUT OF HUMOUR.
HE WAS NOT AN ILL-TEMPERED MAN, NOT SO OFTEN UNREASONABLY CROSS
AS TO DESERVE SUCH A REPROACH; BUT HIS TEMPER WAS NOT HIS
GREAT PERFECTION; AND, INDEED, WITH SUCH A WORSHIPPING WIFE,
IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT ANY NATURAL DEFECTS IN IT SHOULD NOT
BE INCREASED.  THE EXTREME SWEETNESS OF HER TEMPER MUST HURT HIS.
HE HAD ALL THE CLEARNESS AND QUICKNESS OF MIND WHICH SHE WANTED,
AND HE COULD SOMETIMES ACT AN UNGRACIOUS, OR SAY A SEVERE THING.

HE WAS NOT A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH HIS FAIR SISTER-IN-LAW. NOTHING
WRONG IN HIM ESCAPED HER.  SHE WAS QUICK IN FEELING THE LITTLE
INJURIES TO ISABELLA, WHICH ISABELLA NEVER FELT HERSELF.
PERHAPS SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED OVER MORE HAD HIS MANNERS BEEN
FLATTERING TO ISABELLA'S SISTER, BUT THEY WERE ONLY THOSE OF A CALMLY
KIND BROTHER AND FRIEND, WITHOUT PRAISE AND WITHOUT BLINDNESS;
BUT HARDLY ANY DEGREE OF PERSONAL COMPLIMENT COULD HAVE MADE HER
REGARDLESS OF THAT GREATEST FAULT OF ALL IN HER EYES WHICH HE SOMETIMES
FELL INTO, THE WANT OF RESPECTFUL FORBEARANCE TOWARDS HER FATHER.
THERE HE HAD NOT ALWAYS THE PATIENCE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN WISHED.
MR. WOODHOUSE'S PECULIARITIES AND FIDGETINESS WERE SOMETIMES PROVOKING
HIM TO A RATIONAL REMONSTRANCE OR SHARP RETORT EQUALLY ILL-BESTOWED.
IT DID NOT OFTEN HAPPEN; FOR MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY HAD REALLY A GREAT
REGARD FOR HIS FATHER-IN-LAW, AND GENERALLY A STRONG SENSE OF WHAT WAS
DUE TO HIM; BUT IT WAS TOO OFTEN FOR EMMA'S CHARITY, ESPECIALLY AS
THERE WAS ALL THE PAIN OF APPREHENSION FREQUENTLY TO BE ENDURED,
THOUGH THE OFFENCE CAME NOT.  THE BEGINNING, HOWEVER, OF EVERY VISIT
DISPLAYED NONE BUT THE PROPEREST FEELINGS, AND THIS BEING OF NECESSITY
SO SHORT MIGHT BE HOPED TO PASS AWAY IN UNSULLIED CORDIALITY.
THEY HAD NOT BEEN LONG SEATED AND COMPOSED WHEN MR. WOODHOUSE,
WITH A MELANCHOLY SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND A SIGH, CALLED HIS DAUGHTER'S
ATTENTION TO THE SAD CHANGE AT HARTFIELD SINCE SHE HAD BEEN THERE LAST.

"AH, MY DEAR," SAID HE, "POOR MISS TAYLOR--IT IS A GRIEVOUS BUSINESS."

"OH YES, SIR," CRIED SHE WITH READY SYMPATHY, "HOW YOU MUST
MISS HER!  AND DEAR EMMA, TOO!--WHAT A DREADFUL LOSS TO YOU BOTH!--
I HAVE BEEN SO GRIEVED FOR YOU.--I COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW YOU COULD
POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT HER.--IT IS A SAD CHANGE INDEED.--BUT I HOPE
SHE IS PRETTY WELL, SIR."

"PRETTY WELL, MY DEAR--I HOPE--PRETTY WELL.--I DO NOT KNOW
BUT THAT THE PLACE AGREES WITH HER TOLERABLY."

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY HERE ASKED EMMA QUIETLY WHETHER THERE WERE ANY
DOUBTS OF THE AIR OF RANDALLS.

"OH! NO--NONE IN THE LEAST.  I NEVER SAW MRS. WESTON BETTER IN MY LIFE--
NEVER LOOKING SO WELL.  PAPA IS ONLY SPEAKING HIS OWN REGRET."

"VERY MUCH TO THE HONOUR OF BOTH," WAS THE HANDSOME REPLY.

"AND DO YOU SEE HER, SIR, TOLERABLY OFTEN?" ASKED ISABELLA
IN THE PLAINTIVE TONE WHICH JUST SUITED HER FATHER.

MR. WOODHOUSE HESITATED.--"NOT NEAR SO OFTEN, MY DEAR, AS I COULD WISH."

"OH! PAPA, WE HAVE MISSED SEEING THEM BUT ONE ENTIRE DAY SINCE
THEY MARRIED.  EITHER IN THE MORNING OR EVENING OF EVERY DAY,
EXCEPTING ONE, HAVE WE SEEN EITHER MR. WESTON OR MRS. WESTON,
AND GENERALLY BOTH, EITHER AT RANDALLS OR HERE--AND AS YOU
MAY SUPPOSE, ISABELLA, MOST FREQUENTLY HERE.  THEY ARE VERY,
VERY KIND IN THEIR VISITS.  MR. WESTON IS REALLY AS KIND AS HERSELF.
PAPA, IF YOU SPEAK IN THAT MELANCHOLY WAY, YOU WILL BE GIVING
ISABELLA A FALSE IDEA OF US ALL.  EVERY BODY MUST BE AWARE THAT MISS
TAYLOR MUST BE MISSED, BUT EVERY BODY OUGHT ALSO TO BE ASSURED
THAT MR. AND MRS. WESTON DO REALLY PREVENT OUR MISSING HER BY ANY
MEANS TO THE EXTENT WE OURSELVES ANTICIPATED--WHICH IS THE EXACT TRUTH."

"JUST AS IT SHOULD BE," SAID MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY, "AND JUST AS I HOPED
IT WAS FROM YOUR LETTERS.  HER WISH OF SHEWING YOU ATTENTION COULD
NOT BE DOUBTED, AND HIS BEING A DISENGAGED AND SOCIAL MAN MAKES IT
ALL EASY.  I HAVE BEEN ALWAYS TELLING YOU, MY LOVE, THAT I HAD NO IDEA
OF THE CHANGE BEING SO VERY MATERIAL TO HARTFIELD AS YOU APPREHENDED;
AND NOW YOU HAVE EMMA'S ACCOUNT, I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED."

"WHY, TO BE SURE," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE--"YES, CERTAINLY--I CANNOT DENY
THAT MRS. WESTON, POOR MRS. WESTON, DOES COME AND SEE US PRETTY OFTEN--
BUT THEN--SHE IS ALWAYS OBLIGED TO GO AWAY AGAIN."

"IT WOULD BE VERY HARD UPON MR. WESTON IF SHE DID NOT, PAPA.--
YOU QUITE FORGET POOR MR. WESTON."

"I THINK, INDEED," SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY PLEASANTLY, "THAT MR. WESTON
HAS SOME LITTLE CLAIM.  YOU AND I, EMMA, WILL VENTURE TO TAKE THE PART
OF THE POOR HUSBAND.  I, BEING A HUSBAND, AND YOU NOT BEING A WIFE,
THE CLAIMS OF THE MAN MAY VERY LIKELY STRIKE US WITH EQUAL FORCE.
AS FOR ISABELLA, SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THE CONVENIENCE
OF PUTTING ALL THE MR. WESTONS ASIDE AS MUCH AS SHE CAN."

"ME, MY LOVE," CRIED HIS WIFE, HEARING AND UNDERSTANDING ONLY IN PART.--
"ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?--I AM SURE NOBODY OUGHT TO BE, OR CAN BE,
A GREATER ADVOCATE FOR MATRIMONY THAN I AM; AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN
FOR THE MISERY OF HER LEAVING HARTFIELD, I SHOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT
OF MISS TAYLOR BUT AS THE MOST FORTUNATE WOMAN IN THE WORLD;
AND AS TO SLIGHTING MR. WESTON, THAT EXCELLENT MR. WESTON, I THINK
THERE IS NOTHING HE DOES NOT DESERVE.  I BELIEVE HE IS ONE OF THE
VERY BEST-TEMPERED MEN THAT EVER EXISTED.  EXCEPTING YOURSELF
AND YOUR BROTHER, I DO NOT KNOW HIS EQUAL FOR TEMPER.  I SHALL
NEVER FORGET HIS FLYING HENRY'S KITE FOR HIM THAT VERY WINDY DAY
LAST EASTER--AND EVER SINCE HIS PARTICULAR KINDNESS LAST SEPTEMBER
TWELVEMONTH IN WRITING THAT NOTE, AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT,
ON PURPOSE TO ASSURE ME THAT THERE WAS NO SCARLET FEVER AT COBHAM,
I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THERE COULD NOT BE A MORE FEELING HEART NOR
A BETTER MAN IN EXISTENCE.--IF ANY BODY CAN DESERVE HIM, IT MUST BE
MISS TAYLOR."

"WHERE IS THE YOUNG MAN?" SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY.  "HAS HE BEEN HERE
ON THIS OCCASION--OR HAS HE NOT?"

"HE HAS NOT BEEN HERE YET," REPLIED EMMA.  "THERE WAS A STRONG
EXPECTATION OF HIS COMING SOON AFTER THE MARRIAGE, BUT IT ENDED
IN NOTHING; AND I HAVE NOT HEARD HIM MENTIONED LATELY."

"BUT YOU SHOULD TELL THEM OF THE LETTER, MY DEAR," SAID HER FATHER.
"HE WROTE A LETTER TO POOR MRS. WESTON, TO CONGRATULATE HER,
AND A VERY PROPER, HANDSOME LETTER IT WAS.  SHE SHEWED IT TO ME.
I THOUGHT IT VERY WELL DONE OF HIM INDEED.  WHETHER IT WAS HIS OWN IDEA
YOU KNOW, ONE CANNOT TELL.  HE IS BUT YOUNG, AND HIS UNCLE, PERHAPS--"

"MY DEAR PAPA, HE IS THREE-AND-TWENTY. YOU FORGET HOW TIME PASSES."

"THREE-AND-TWENTY!--IS HE INDEED?--WELL, I COULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT--
AND HE WAS BUT TWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE LOST HIS POOR MOTHER!  WELL,
TIME DOES FLY INDEED!--AND MY MEMORY IS VERY BAD.  HOWEVER, IT WAS
AN EXCEEDING GOOD, PRETTY LETTER, AND GAVE MR. AND MRS. WESTON
A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE.  I REMEMBER IT WAS WRITTEN FROM WEYMOUTH,
AND DATED SEPT. 28TH--AND BEGAN, `MY DEAR MADAM,' BUT I FORGET
HOW IT WENT ON; AND IT WAS SIGNED `F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.'--
I REMEMBER THAT PERFECTLY."

"HOW VERY PLEASING AND PROPER OF HIM!" CRIED THE GOOD-HEARTED MRS. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY.  "I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING A MOST AMIABLE YOUNG MAN.
BUT HOW SAD IT IS THAT HE SHOULD NOT LIVE AT HOME WITH HIS FATHER!
THERE IS SOMETHING SO SHOCKING IN A CHILD'S BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM HIS
PARENTS AND NATURAL HOME!  I NEVER COULD COMPREHEND HOW MR. WESTON
COULD PART WITH HIM.  TO GIVE UP ONE'S CHILD!  I REALLY NEVER
COULD THINK WELL OF ANY BODY WHO PROPOSED SUCH A THING TO ANY BODY ELSE."

"NOBODY EVER DID THINK WELL OF THE CHURCHILLS, I FANCY,"
OBSERVED MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY COOLLY.  "BUT YOU NEED NOT IMAGINE
MR. WESTON TO HAVE FELT WHAT YOU WOULD FEEL IN GIVING UP HENRY
OR JOHN.  MR. WESTON IS RATHER AN EASY, CHEERFUL-TEMPERED MAN,
THAN A MAN OF STRONG FEELINGS; HE TAKES THINGS AS HE FINDS THEM,
AND MAKES ENJOYMENT OF THEM SOMEHOW OR OTHER, DEPENDING, I SUSPECT,
MUCH MORE UPON WHAT IS CALLED SOCIETY FOR HIS COMFORTS, THAT IS,
UPON THE POWER OF EATING AND DRINKING, AND PLAYING WHIST WITH HIS
NEIGHBOURS FIVE TIMES A WEEK, THAN UPON FAMILY AFFECTION, OR ANY
THING THAT HOME AFFORDS."

EMMA COULD NOT LIKE WHAT BORDERED ON A REFLECTION ON MR. WESTON,
AND HAD HALF A MIND TO TAKE IT UP; BUT SHE STRUGGLED, AND LET
IT PASS.  SHE WOULD KEEP THE PEACE IF POSSIBLE; AND THERE WAS
SOMETHING HONOURABLE AND VALUABLE IN THE STRONG DOMESTIC HABITS,
THE ALL-SUFFICIENCY OF HOME TO HIMSELF, WHENCE RESULTED HER BROTHER'S
DISPOSITION TO LOOK DOWN ON THE COMMON RATE OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE,
AND THOSE TO WHOM IT WAS IMPORTANT.--IT HAD A HIGH CLAIM TO FORBEARANCE.



CHAPTER XII


MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS TO DINE WITH THEM--RATHER AGAINST THE INCLINATION
OF MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO DID NOT LIKE THAT ANY ONE SHOULD SHARE WITH HIM
IN ISABELLA'S FIRST DAY.  EMMA'S SENSE OF RIGHT HOWEVER HAD DECIDED IT;
AND BESIDES THE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT WAS DUE TO EACH BROTHER,
SHE HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE, FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE LATE
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN MR. KNIGHTLEY AND HERSELF, IN PROCURING HIM
THE PROPER INVITATION.

SHE HOPED THEY MIGHT NOW BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN.  SHE THOUGHT IT
WAS TIME TO MAKE UP.  MAKING-UP INDEED WOULD NOT DO.  _SHE_ CERTAINLY
HAD NOT BEEN IN THE WRONG, AND _HE_ WOULD NEVER OWN THAT HE HAD.
CONCESSION MUST BE OUT OF THE QUESTION; BUT IT WAS TIME TO APPEAR
TO FORGET THAT THEY HAD EVER QUARRELLED; AND SHE HOPED IT MIGHT RATHER
ASSIST THE RESTORATION OF FRIENDSHIP, THAT WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
SHE HAD ONE OF THE CHILDREN WITH HER--THE YOUNGEST, A NICE LITTLE GIRL
ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS OLD, WHO WAS NOW MAKING HER FIRST VISIT TO HARTFIELD,
AND VERY HAPPY TO BE DANCED ABOUT IN HER AUNT'S ARMS.  IT DID ASSIST;
FOR THOUGH HE BEGAN WITH GRAVE LOOKS AND SHORT QUESTIONS, HE WAS SOON
LED ON TO TALK OF THEM ALL IN THE USUAL WAY, AND TO TAKE THE CHILD
OUT OF HER ARMS WITH ALL THE UNCEREMONIOUSNESS OF PERFECT AMITY.
EMMA FELT THEY WERE FRIENDS AGAIN; AND THE CONVICTION GIVING
HER AT FIRST GREAT SATISFACTION, AND THEN A LITTLE SAUCINESS,
SHE COULD NOT HELP SAYING, AS HE WAS ADMIRING THE BABY,

"WHAT A COMFORT IT IS, THAT WE THINK ALIKE ABOUT OUR NEPHEWS AND NIECES.
AS TO MEN AND WOMEN, OUR OPINIONS ARE SOMETIMES VERY DIFFERENT;
BUT WITH REGARD TO THESE CHILDREN, I OBSERVE WE NEVER DISAGREE."

"IF YOU WERE AS MUCH GUIDED BY NATURE IN YOUR ESTIMATE OF MEN
AND WOMEN, AND AS LITTLE UNDER THE POWER OF FANCY AND WHIM IN YOUR
DEALINGS WITH THEM, AS YOU ARE WHERE THESE CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED,
WE MIGHT ALWAYS THINK ALIKE."

"TO BE SURE--OUR DISCORDANCIES MUST ALWAYS ARISE FROM MY BEING
IN THE WRONG."

"YES," SAID HE, SMILING--"AND REASON GOOD.  I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS
OLD WHEN YOU WERE BORN."

"A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE THEN," SHE REPLIED--"AND NO DOUBT YOU WERE
MUCH MY SUPERIOR IN JUDGMENT AT THAT PERIOD OF OUR LIVES; BUT DOES
NOT THE LAPSE OF ONE-AND-TWENTY YEARS BRING OUR UNDERSTANDINGS
A GOOD DEAL NEARER?"

"YES--A GOOD DEAL _NEARER_."

"BUT STILL, NOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A CHANCE OF BEING RIGHT,
IF WE THINK DIFFERENTLY."

"I HAVE STILL THE ADVANTAGE OF YOU BY SIXTEEN YEARS' EXPERIENCE, AND BY
NOT BEING A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN AND A SPOILED CHILD.  COME, MY DEAR EMMA,
LET US BE FRIENDS, AND SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT.  TELL YOUR AUNT, LITTLE EMMA,
THAT SHE OUGHT TO SET YOU A BETTER EXAMPLE THAN TO BE RENEWING
OLD GRIEVANCES, AND THAT IF SHE WERE NOT WRONG BEFORE, SHE IS NOW."

"THAT'S TRUE," SHE CRIED--"VERY TRUE.  LITTLE EMMA, GROW UP
A BETTER WOMAN THAN YOUR AUNT.  BE INFINITELY CLEVERER AND NOT
HALF SO CONCEITED.  NOW, MR. KNIGHTLEY, A WORD OR TWO MORE, AND I
HAVE DONE.  AS FAR AS GOOD INTENTIONS WENT, WE WERE _BOTH_ RIGHT,
AND I MUST SAY THAT NO EFFECTS ON MY SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT HAVE YET
PROVED WRONG.  I ONLY WANT TO KNOW THAT MR. MARTIN IS NOT VERY,
VERY BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED."

"A MAN CANNOT BE MORE SO," WAS HIS SHORT, FULL ANSWER.

"AH!--INDEED I AM VERY SORRY.--COME, SHAKE HANDS WITH ME."

THIS HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE AND WITH GREAT CORDIALITY, WHEN JOHN
KNIGHTLEY MADE HIS APPEARANCE, AND "HOW D'YE DO, GEORGE?" AND "JOHN,
HOW ARE YOU?" SUCCEEDED IN THE TRUE ENGLISH STYLE, BURYING UNDER
A CALMNESS THAT SEEMED ALL BUT INDIFFERENCE, THE REAL ATTACHMENT
WHICH WOULD HAVE LED EITHER OF THEM, IF REQUISITE, TO DO EVERY THING
FOR THE GOOD OF THE OTHER.

THE EVENING WAS QUIET AND CONVERSABLE, AS MR. WOODHOUSE DECLINED
CARDS ENTIRELY FOR THE SAKE OF COMFORTABLE TALK WITH HIS
DEAR ISABELLA, AND THE LITTLE PARTY MADE TWO NATURAL DIVISIONS;
ON ONE SIDE HE AND HIS DAUGHTER; ON THE OTHER THE TWO MR. KNIGHTLEYS;
THEIR SUBJECTS TOTALLY DISTINCT, OR VERY RARELY MIXING--AND EMMA
ONLY OCCASIONALLY JOINING IN ONE OR THE OTHER.

THE BROTHERS TALKED OF THEIR OWN CONCERNS AND PURSUITS, BUT PRINCIPALLY
OF THOSE OF THE ELDER, WHOSE TEMPER WAS BY MUCH THE MOST COMMUNICATIVE,
AND WHO WAS ALWAYS THE GREATER TALKER.  AS A MAGISTRATE, HE HAD
GENERALLY SOME POINT OF LAW TO CONSULT JOHN ABOUT, OR, AT LEAST,
SOME CURIOUS ANECDOTE TO GIVE; AND AS A FARMER, AS KEEPING IN HAND
THE HOME-FARM AT DONWELL, HE HAD TO TELL WHAT EVERY FIELD WAS TO BEAR
NEXT YEAR, AND TO GIVE ALL SUCH LOCAL INFORMATION AS COULD NOT FAIL
OF BEING INTERESTING TO A BROTHER WHOSE HOME IT HAD EQUALLY BEEN
THE LONGEST PART OF HIS LIFE, AND WHOSE ATTACHMENTS WERE STRONG.
THE PLAN OF A DRAIN, THE CHANGE OF A FENCE, THE FELLING OF A TREE,
AND THE DESTINATION OF EVERY ACRE FOR WHEAT, TURNIPS, OR SPRING CORN,
WAS ENTERED INTO WITH AS MUCH EQUALITY OF INTEREST BY JOHN, AS HIS
COOLER MANNERS RENDERED POSSIBLE; AND IF HIS WILLING BROTHER EVER
LEFT HIM ANY THING TO INQUIRE ABOUT, HIS INQUIRIES EVEN APPROACHED
A TONE OF EAGERNESS.

WHILE THEY WERE THUS COMFORTABLY OCCUPIED, MR. WOODHOUSE WAS ENJOYING
A FULL FLOW OF HAPPY REGRETS AND FEARFUL AFFECTION WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

"MY POOR DEAR ISABELLA," SAID HE, FONDLY TAKING HER HAND,
AND INTERRUPTING, FOR A FEW MOMENTS, HER BUSY LABOURS FOR SOME ONE
OF HER FIVE CHILDREN--"HOW LONG IT IS, HOW TERRIBLY LONG SINCE YOU
WERE HERE!  AND HOW TIRED YOU MUST BE AFTER YOUR JOURNEY!  YOU MUST
GO TO BED EARLY, MY DEAR--AND I RECOMMEND A LITTLE GRUEL TO YOU
BEFORE YOU GO.--YOU AND I WILL HAVE A NICE BASIN OF GRUEL TOGETHER.
MY DEAR EMMA, SUPPOSE WE ALL HAVE A LITTLE GRUEL."

EMMA COULD NOT SUPPOSE ANY SUCH THING, KNOWING AS SHE DID,
THAT BOTH THE MR. KNIGHTLEYS WERE AS UNPERSUADABLE ON THAT ARTICLE
AS HERSELF;--AND TWO BASINS ONLY WERE ORDERED.  AFTER A LITTLE
MORE DISCOURSE IN PRAISE OF GRUEL, WITH SOME WONDERING AT ITS
NOT BEING TAKEN EVERY EVENING BY EVERY BODY, HE PROCEEDED TO SAY,
WITH AN AIR OF GRAVE REFLECTION,

"IT WAS AN AWKWARD BUSINESS, MY DEAR, YOUR SPENDING THE AUTUMN
AT SOUTH END INSTEAD OF COMING HERE.  I NEVER HAD MUCH OPINION
OF THE SEA AIR."

"MR. WINGFIELD MOST STRENUOUSLY RECOMMENDED IT, SIR--OR WE
SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE.  HE RECOMMENDED IT FOR ALL THE CHILDREN,
BUT PARTICULARLY FOR THE WEAKNESS IN LITTLE BELLA'S THROAT,--
BOTH SEA AIR AND BATHING."

"AH! MY DEAR, BUT PERRY HAD MANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE SEA DOING HER
ANY GOOD; AND AS TO MYSELF, I HAVE BEEN LONG PERFECTLY CONVINCED,
THOUGH PERHAPS I NEVER TOLD YOU SO BEFORE, THAT THE SEA IS VERY
RARELY OF USE TO ANY BODY.  I AM SURE IT ALMOST KILLED ME ONCE."

"COME, COME," CRIED EMMA, FEELING THIS TO BE AN UNSAFE SUBJECT, "I MUST
BEG YOU NOT TO TALK OF THE SEA.  IT MAKES ME ENVIOUS AND MISERABLE;--
I WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN IT!  SOUTH END IS PROHIBITED, IF YOU PLEASE.
MY DEAR ISABELLA, I HAVE NOT HEARD YOU MAKE ONE INQUIRY ABOUT
MR. PERRY YET; AND HE NEVER FORGETS YOU."

"OH! GOOD MR. PERRY--HOW IS HE, SIR?"

"WHY, PRETTY WELL; BUT NOT QUITE WELL.  POOR PERRY IS BILIOUS,
AND HE HAS NOT TIME TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF--HE TELLS ME HE HAS
NOT TIME TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF--WHICH IS VERY SAD--BUT HE IS
ALWAYS WANTED ALL ROUND THE COUNTRY.  I SUPPOSE THERE IS NOT A MAN
IN SUCH PRACTICE ANYWHERE.  BUT THEN THERE IS NOT SO CLEVER A MAN
ANY WHERE."

"AND MRS. PERRY AND THE CHILDREN, HOW ARE THEY? DO THE CHILDREN GROW?
I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR MR. PERRY.  I HOPE HE WILL BE CALLING SOON.
HE WILL BE SO PLEASED TO SEE MY LITTLE ONES."

"I HOPE HE WILL BE HERE TO-MORROW, FOR I HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO TO ASK
HIM ABOUT MYSELF OF SOME CONSEQUENCE.  AND, MY DEAR, WHENEVER HE COMES,
YOU HAD BETTER LET HIM LOOK AT LITTLE BELLA'S THROAT."

"OH! MY DEAR SIR, HER THROAT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAT I HAVE HARDLY
ANY UNEASINESS ABOUT IT.  EITHER BATHING HAS BEEN OF THE GREATEST
SERVICE TO HER, OR ELSE IT IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO AN EXCELLENT
EMBROCATION OF MR. WINGFIELD'S, WHICH WE HAVE BEEN APPLYING
AT TIMES EVER SINCE AUGUST."

"IT IS NOT VERY LIKELY, MY DEAR, THAT BATHING SHOULD HAVE BEEN
OF USE TO HER--AND IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE WANTING AN EMBROCATION,
I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO--

"YOU SEEM TO ME TO HAVE FORGOTTEN MRS. AND MISS BATES," SAID EMMA,
"I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE INQUIRY AFTER THEM."

"OH! THE GOOD BATESES--I AM QUITE ASHAMED OF MYSELF--BUT YOU
MENTION THEM IN MOST OF YOUR LETTERS.  I HOPE THEY ARE QUITE WELL.
GOOD OLD MRS. BATES--I WILL CALL UPON HER TO-MORROW, AND TAKE
MY CHILDREN.--THEY ARE ALWAYS SO PLEASED TO SEE MY CHILDREN.--
AND THAT EXCELLENT MISS BATES!--SUCH THOROUGH WORTHY PEOPLE!--
HOW ARE THEY, SIR?"

"WHY, PRETTY WELL, MY DEAR, UPON THE WHOLE.  BUT POOR MRS. BATES
HAD A BAD COLD ABOUT A MONTH AGO."

"HOW SORRY I AM!  BUT COLDS WERE NEVER SO PREVALENT AS THEY HAVE BEEN
THIS AUTUMN.  MR. WINGFIELD TOLD ME THAT HE HAS NEVER KNOWN THEM
MORE GENERAL OR HEAVY--EXCEPT WHEN IT HAS BEEN QUITE AN INFLUENZA."

"THAT HAS BEEN A GOOD DEAL THE CASE, MY DEAR; BUT NOT TO THE DEGREE
YOU MENTION.  PERRY SAYS THAT COLDS HAVE BEEN VERY GENERAL,
BUT NOT SO HEAVY AS HE HAS VERY OFTEN KNOWN THEM IN NOVEMBER.
PERRY DOES NOT CALL IT ALTOGETHER A SICKLY SEASON."

"NO, I DO NOT KNOW THAT MR. WINGFIELD CONSIDERS IT _VERY_ SICKLY EXCEPT--

"AH! MY POOR DEAR CHILD, THE TRUTH IS, THAT IN LONDON IT IS ALWAYS
A SICKLY SEASON.  NOBODY IS HEALTHY IN LONDON, NOBODY CAN BE.
IT IS A DREADFUL THING TO HAVE YOU FORCED TO LIVE THERE! SO FAR OFF!--
AND THE AIR SO BAD!"

"NO, INDEED--_WE_ ARE NOT AT ALL IN A BAD AIR.  OUR PART OF LONDON IS
VERY SUPERIOR TO MOST OTHERS!--YOU MUST NOT CONFOUND US WITH LONDON
IN GENERAL, MY DEAR SIR.  THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BRUNSWICK SQUARE
IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ALMOST ALL THE REST.  WE ARE SO VERY AIRY!
I SHOULD BE UNWILLING, I OWN, TO LIVE IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE TOWN;--
THERE IS HARDLY ANY OTHER THAT I COULD BE SATISFIED TO HAVE MY
CHILDREN IN:  BUT _WE_ ARE SO REMARKABLY AIRY!--MR. WINGFIELD THINKS
THE VICINITY OF BRUNSWICK SQUARE DECIDEDLY THE MOST FAVOURABLE AS
TO AIR."

"AH! MY DEAR, IT IS NOT LIKE HARTFIELD.  YOU MAKE THE BEST OF IT--
BUT AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN A WEEK AT HARTFIELD, YOU ARE ALL OF YOU
DIFFERENT CREATURES; YOU DO NOT LOOK LIKE THE SAME.  NOW I CANNOT SAY,
THAT I THINK YOU ARE ANY OF YOU LOOKING WELL AT PRESENT."

"I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU SAY SO, SIR; BUT I ASSURE YOU, EXCEPTING THOSE
LITTLE NERVOUS HEAD-ACHES AND PALPITATIONS WHICH I AM NEVER ENTIRELY
FREE FROM ANYWHERE, I AM QUITE WELL MYSELF; AND IF THE CHILDREN WERE
RATHER PALE BEFORE THEY WENT TO BED, IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE
A LITTLE MORE TIRED THAN USUAL, FROM THEIR JOURNEY AND THE HAPPINESS
OF COMING.  I HOPE YOU WILL THINK BETTER OF THEIR LOOKS TO-MORROW;
FOR I ASSURE YOU MR. WINGFIELD TOLD ME, THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE
HE HAD EVER SENT US OFF ALTOGETHER, IN SUCH GOOD CASE.  I TRUST,
AT LEAST, THAT YOU DO NOT THINK MR. KNIGHTLEY LOOKING ILL,"
TURNING HER EYES WITH AFFECTIONATE ANXIETY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND.

"MIDDLING, MY DEAR; I CANNOT COMPLIMENT YOU.  I THINK MR. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY VERY FAR FROM LOOKING WELL."

"WHAT IS THE MATTER, SIR?--DID YOU SPEAK TO ME?" CRIED MR. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY, HEARING HIS OWN NAME.

"I AM SORRY TO FIND, MY LOVE, THAT MY FATHER DOES NOT THINK YOU
LOOKING WELL--BUT I HOPE IT IS ONLY FROM BEING A LITTLE FATIGUED.
I COULD HAVE WISHED, HOWEVER, AS YOU KNOW, THAT YOU HAD SEEN
MR. WINGFIELD BEFORE YOU LEFT HOME."

"MY DEAR ISABELLA,"--EXCLAIMED HE HASTILY--"PRAY DO NOT CONCERN
YOURSELF ABOUT MY LOOKS.  BE SATISFIED WITH DOCTORING AND CODDLING
YOURSELF AND THE CHILDREN, AND LET ME LOOK AS I CHUSE."

"I DID NOT THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE TELLING YOUR BROTHER,"
CRIED EMMA, "ABOUT YOUR FRIEND MR. GRAHAM'S INTENDING TO HAVE A BAILIFF
FROM SCOTLAND, TO LOOK AFTER HIS NEW ESTATE.  WHAT WILL IT ANSWER?
WILL NOT THE OLD PREJUDICE BE TOO STRONG?"

AND SHE TALKED IN THIS WAY SO LONG AND SUCCESSFULLY THAT, WHEN FORCED
TO GIVE HER ATTENTION AGAIN TO HER FATHER AND SISTER, SHE HAD NOTHING
WORSE TO HEAR THAN ISABELLA'S KIND INQUIRY AFTER JANE FAIRFAX;
AND JANE FAIRFAX, THOUGH NO GREAT FAVOURITE WITH HER IN GENERAL,
SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT VERY HAPPY TO ASSIST IN PRAISING.

"THAT SWEET, AMIABLE JANE FAIRFAX!" SAID MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY.--
"IT IS SO LONG SINCE I HAVE SEEN HER, EXCEPT NOW AND THEN FOR A MOMENT
ACCIDENTALLY IN TOWN!  WHAT HAPPINESS IT MUST BE TO HER GOOD OLD
GRANDMOTHER AND EXCELLENT AUNT, WHEN SHE COMES TO VISIT THEM!
I ALWAYS REGRET EXCESSIVELY ON DEAR EMMA'S ACCOUNT THAT SHE CANNOT
BE MORE AT HIGHBURY; BUT NOW THEIR DAUGHTER IS MARRIED, I SUPPOSE
COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PART WITH HER AT ALL.
SHE WOULD BE SUCH A DELIGHTFUL COMPANION FOR EMMA."

MR. WOODHOUSE AGREED TO IT ALL, BUT ADDED,

"OUR LITTLE FRIEND HARRIET SMITH, HOWEVER, IS JUST SUCH ANOTHER
PRETTY KIND OF YOUNG PERSON.  YOU WILL LIKE HARRIET.  EMMA COULD
NOT HAVE A BETTER COMPANION THAN HARRIET."

"I AM MOST HAPPY TO HEAR IT--BUT ONLY JANE FAIRFAX ONE KNOWS TO BE
SO VERY ACCOMPLISHED AND SUPERIOR!--AND EXACTLY EMMA'S AGE."

THIS TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED VERY HAPPILY, AND OTHERS SUCCEEDED OF
SIMILAR MOMENT, AND PASSED AWAY WITH SIMILAR HARMONY; BUT THE EVENING
DID NOT CLOSE WITHOUT A LITTLE RETURN OF AGITATION.  THE GRUEL CAME
AND SUPPLIED A GREAT DEAL TO BE SAID--MUCH PRAISE AND MANY COMMENTS--
UNDOUBTING DECISION OF ITS WHOLESOMENESS FOR EVERY CONSTITUTION,
AND PRETTY SEVERE PHILIPPICS UPON THE MANY HOUSES WHERE IT WAS
NEVER MET WITH TOLERABLE;--BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, AMONG THE FAILURES
WHICH THE DAUGHTER HAD TO INSTANCE, THE MOST RECENT, AND THEREFORE
MOST PROMINENT, WAS IN HER OWN COOK AT SOUTH END, A YOUNG WOMAN
HIRED FOR THE TIME, WHO NEVER HAD BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE
MEANT BY A BASIN OF NICE SMOOTH GRUEL, THIN, BUT NOT TOO THIN.
OFTEN AS SHE HAD WISHED FOR AND ORDERED IT, SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO GET ANY THING TOLERABLE.  HERE WAS A DANGEROUS OPENING.

"AH!" SAID MR. WOODHOUSE, SHAKING HIS HEAD AND FIXING HIS EYES ON
HER WITH TENDER CONCERN.--THE EJACULATION IN EMMA'S EAR EXPRESSED,
"AH! THERE IS NO END OF THE SAD CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR GOING TO
SOUTH END.  IT DOES NOT BEAR TALKING OF."  AND FOR A LITTLE WHILE
SHE HOPED HE WOULD NOT TALK OF IT, AND THAT A SILENT RUMINATION
MIGHT SUFFICE TO RESTORE HIM TO THE RELISH OF HIS OWN SMOOTH GRUEL.
AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SOME MINUTES, HOWEVER, HE BEGAN WITH,

"I SHALL ALWAYS BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU WENT TO THE SEA THIS AUTUMN,
INSTEAD OF COMING HERE."

"BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BE SORRY, SIR?--I ASSURE YOU, IT DID THE CHILDREN
A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD."

"AND, MOREOVER, IF YOU MUST GO TO THE SEA, IT HAD BETTER NOT
HAVE BEEN TO SOUTH END.  SOUTH END IS AN UNHEALTHY PLACE.
PERRY WAS SURPRIZED TO HEAR YOU HAD FIXED UPON SOUTH END."

"I KNOW THERE IS SUCH AN IDEA WITH MANY PEOPLE, BUT INDEED IT IS
QUITE A MISTAKE, SIR.--WE ALL HAD OUR HEALTH PERFECTLY WELL THERE,
NEVER FOUND THE LEAST INCONVENIENCE FROM THE MUD; AND MR. WINGFIELD
SAYS IT IS ENTIRELY A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THE PLACE UNHEALTHY;
AND I AM SURE HE MAY BE DEPENDED ON, FOR HE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS
THE NATURE OF THE AIR, AND HIS OWN BROTHER AND FAMILY HAVE BEEN
THERE REPEATEDLY."

"YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CROMER, MY DEAR, IF YOU WENT ANYWHERE.--
PERRY WAS A WEEK AT CROMER ONCE, AND HE HOLDS IT TO BE THE BEST
OF ALL THE SEA-BATHING PLACES.  A FINE OPEN SEA, HE SAYS, AND VERY
PURE AIR.  AND, BY WHAT I UNDERSTAND, YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD LODGINGS THERE
QUITE AWAY FROM THE SEA--A QUARTER OF A MILE OFF--VERY COMFORTABLE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED PERRY."

"BUT, MY DEAR SIR, THE DIFFERENCE OF THE JOURNEY;--ONLY CONSIDER HOW
GREAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.--AN HUNDRED MILES, PERHAPS, INSTEAD OF FORTY."

"AH! MY DEAR, AS PERRY SAYS, WHERE HEALTH IS AT STAKE, NOTHING ELSE
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; AND IF ONE IS TO TRAVEL, THERE IS NOT MUCH
TO CHUSE BETWEEN FORTY MILES AND AN HUNDRED.--BETTER NOT MOVE AT ALL,
BETTER STAY IN LONDON ALTOGETHER THAN TRAVEL FORTY MILES TO GET
INTO A WORSE AIR.  THIS IS JUST WHAT PERRY SAID.  IT SEEMED TO HIM
A VERY ILL-JUDGED MEASURE."

EMMA'S ATTEMPTS TO STOP HER FATHER HAD BEEN VAIN; AND WHEN HE
HAD REACHED SUCH A POINT AS THIS, SHE COULD NOT WONDER AT HER
BROTHER-IN-LAW'S BREAKING OUT.

"MR. PERRY," SAID HE, IN A VOICE OF VERY STRONG DISPLEASURE,
"WOULD DO AS WELL TO KEEP HIS OPINION TILL IT IS ASKED FOR.
WHY DOES HE MAKE IT ANY BUSINESS OF HIS, TO WONDER AT WHAT I DO?--
AT MY TAKING MY FAMILY TO ONE PART OF THE COAST OR ANOTHER?--I MAY
BE ALLOWED, I HOPE, THE USE OF MY JUDGMENT AS WELL AS MR. PERRY.--
I WANT HIS DIRECTIONS NO MORE THAN HIS DRUGS."  HE PAUSED--
AND GROWING COOLER IN A MOMENT, ADDED, WITH ONLY SARCASTIC DRYNESS,
"IF MR. PERRY CAN TELL ME HOW TO CONVEY A WIFE AND FIVE CHILDREN
A DISTANCE OF AN HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES WITH NO GREATER EXPENSE
OR INCONVENIENCE THAN A DISTANCE OF FORTY, I SHOULD BE AS WILLING TO
PREFER CROMER TO SOUTH END AS HE COULD HIMSELF."

"TRUE, TRUE," CRIED MR. KNIGHTLEY, WITH MOST READY INTERPOSITION--
"VERY TRUE.  THAT'S A CONSIDERATION INDEED.--BUT JOHN, AS TO WHAT I
WAS TELLING YOU OF MY IDEA OF MOVING THE PATH TO LANGHAM, OF TURNING
IT MORE TO THE RIGHT THAT IT MAY NOT CUT THROUGH THE HOME MEADOWS,
I CANNOT CONCEIVE ANY DIFFICULTY.  I SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT IT,
IF IT WERE TO BE THE MEANS OF INCONVENIENCE TO THE HIGHBURY PEOPLE,
BUT IF YOU CALL TO MIND EXACTLY THE PRESENT LINE OF THE PATH. . . .
THE ONLY WAY OF PROVING IT, HOWEVER, WILL BE TO TURN TO OUR MAPS.
I SHALL SEE YOU AT THE ABBEY TO-MORROW MORNING I HOPE, AND THEN WE
WILL LOOK THEM OVER, AND YOU SHALL GIVE ME YOUR OPINION."

MR. WOODHOUSE WAS RATHER AGITATED BY SUCH HARSH REFLECTIONS ON
HIS FRIEND PERRY, TO WHOM HE HAD, IN FACT, THOUGH UNCONSCIOUSLY,
BEEN ATTRIBUTING MANY OF HIS OWN FEELINGS AND EXPRESSIONS;--
BUT THE SOOTHING ATTENTIONS OF HIS DAUGHTERS GRADUALLY REMOVED
THE PRESENT EVIL, AND THE IMMEDIATE ALERTNESS OF ONE BROTHER,
AND BETTER RECOLLECTIONS OF THE OTHER, PREVENTED ANY RENEWAL OF IT.



CHAPTER XIII


THERE COULD HARDLY BE A HAPPIER CREATURE IN THE WORLD THAN MRS. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY, IN THIS SHORT VISIT TO HARTFIELD, GOING ABOUT EVERY MORNING
AMONG HER OLD ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER FIVE CHILDREN, AND TALKING
OVER WHAT SHE HAD DONE EVERY EVENING WITH HER FATHER AND SISTER.
SHE HAD NOTHING TO WISH OTHERWISE, BUT THAT THE DAYS DID NOT PASS
SO SWIFTLY.  IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL VISIT;--PERFECT, IN BEING MUCH TOO SHORT.

IN GENERAL THEIR EVENINGS WERE LESS ENGAGED WITH FRIENDS THAN
THEIR MORNINGS; BUT ONE COMPLETE DINNER ENGAGEMENT, AND OUT
OF THE HOUSE TOO, THERE WAS NO AVOIDING, THOUGH AT CHRISTMAS.
MR. WESTON WOULD TAKE NO DENIAL; THEY MUST ALL DINE AT RANDALLS
ONE DAY;--EVEN MR. WOODHOUSE WAS PERSUADED TO THINK IT A POSSIBLE
THING IN PREFERENCE TO A DIVISION OF THE PARTY.

HOW THEY WERE ALL TO BE CONVEYED, HE WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFICULTY
IF HE COULD, BUT AS HIS SON AND DAUGHTER'S CARRIAGE AND HORSES
WERE ACTUALLY AT HARTFIELD, HE WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE MORE THAN
A SIMPLE QUESTION ON THAT HEAD; IT HARDLY AMOUNTED TO A DOUBT;
NOR DID IT OCCUPY EMMA LONG TO CONVINCE HIM THAT THEY MIGHT IN ONE
OF THE CARRIAGES FIND ROOM FOR HARRIET ALSO.

HARRIET, MR. ELTON, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY, THEIR OWN ESPECIAL SET,
WERE THE ONLY PERSONS INVITED TO MEET THEM;--THE HOURS WERE TO BE EARLY,
AS WELL AS THE NUMBERS FEW; MR. WOODHOUSE'S HABITS AND INCLINATION
BEING CONSULTED IN EVERY THING.

THE EVENING BEFORE THIS GREAT EVENT (FOR IT WAS A VERY GREAT EVENT
THAT MR. WOODHOUSE SHOULD DINE OUT, ON THE 24TH OF DECEMBER) HAD BEEN
SPENT BY HARRIET AT HARTFIELD, AND SHE HAD GONE HOME SO MUCH INDISPOSED
WITH A COLD, THAT, BUT FOR HER OWN EARNEST WISH OF BEING NURSED
BY MRS. GODDARD, EMMA COULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.
EMMA CALLED ON HER THE NEXT DAY, AND FOUND HER DOOM ALREADY SIGNED
WITH REGARD TO RANDALLS.  SHE WAS VERY FEVERISH AND HAD A BAD
SORE THROAT:  MRS. GODDARD WAS FULL OF CARE AND AFFECTION, MR. PERRY
WAS TALKED OF, AND HARRIET HERSELF WAS TOO ILL AND LOW TO RESIST
THE AUTHORITY WHICH EXCLUDED HER FROM THIS DELIGHTFUL ENGAGEMENT,
THOUGH SHE COULD NOT SPEAK OF HER LOSS WITHOUT MANY TEARS.

EMMA SAT WITH HER AS LONG AS SHE COULD, TO ATTEND HER IN MRS. GODDARD'S
UNAVOIDABLE ABSENCES, AND RAISE HER SPIRITS BY REPRESENTING HOW MUCH
MR. ELTON'S WOULD BE DEPRESSED WHEN HE KNEW HER STATE; AND LEFT HER
AT LAST TOLERABLY COMFORTABLE, IN THE SWEET DEPENDENCE OF HIS HAVING
A MOST COMFORTLESS VISIT, AND OF THEIR ALL MISSING HER VERY MUCH.
SHE HAD NOT ADVANCED MANY YARDS FROM MRS. GODDARD'S DOOR, WHEN SHE
WAS MET BY MR. ELTON HIMSELF, EVIDENTLY COMING TOWARDS IT, AND AS
THEY WALKED ON SLOWLY TOGETHER IN CONVERSATION ABOUT THE INVALID--
OF WHOM HE, ON THE RUMOUR OF CONSIDERABLE ILLNESS, HAD BEEN GOING
TO INQUIRE, THAT HE MIGHT CARRY SOME REPORT OF HER TO HARTFIELD--
THEY WERE OVERTAKEN BY MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY RETURNING FROM THE
DAILY VISIT TO DONWELL, WITH HIS TWO ELDEST BOYS, WHOSE HEALTHY,
GLOWING FACES SHEWED ALL THE BENEFIT OF A COUNTRY RUN, AND SEEMED
TO ENSURE A QUICK DESPATCH OF THE ROAST MUTTON AND RICE PUDDING THEY
WERE HASTENING HOME FOR.  THEY JOINED COMPANY AND PROCEEDED TOGETHER.
EMMA WAS JUST DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HER FRIEND'S COMPLAINT;--
"A THROAT VERY MUCH INFLAMED, WITH A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT ABOUT HER,
A QUICK, LOW PULSE, &C.  AND SHE WAS SORRY TO FIND FROM MRS. GODDARD
THAT HARRIET WAS LIABLE TO VERY BAD SORE-THROATS, AND HAD OFTEN
ALARMED HER WITH THEM."  MR. ELTON LOOKED ALL ALARM ON THE OCCASION,
AS HE EXCLAIMED,

"A SORE-THROAT!--I HOPE NOT INFECTIOUS.  I HOPE NOT OF A PUTRID
INFECTIOUS SORT.  HAS PERRY SEEN HER?  INDEED YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF AS WELL AS OF YOUR FRIEND.  LET ME ENTREAT YOU TO RUN
NO RISKS.  WHY DOES NOT PERRY SEE HER?"

EMMA, WHO WAS NOT REALLY AT ALL FRIGHTENED HERSELF, TRANQUILLISED THIS
EXCESS OF APPREHENSION BY ASSURANCES OF MRS. GODDARD'S EXPERIENCE
AND CARE; BUT AS THERE MUST STILL REMAIN A DEGREE OF UNEASINESS
WHICH SHE COULD NOT WISH TO REASON AWAY, WHICH SHE WOULD RATHER
FEED AND ASSIST THAN NOT, SHE ADDED SOON AFTERWARDS--AS IF QUITE
ANOTHER SUBJECT,

"IT IS SO COLD, SO VERY COLD--AND LOOKS AND FEELS SO VERY MUCH
LIKE SNOW, THAT IF IT WERE TO ANY OTHER PLACE OR WITH ANY OTHER PARTY,
I SHOULD REALLY TRY NOT TO GO OUT TO-DAY--AND DISSUADE MY FATHER
FROM VENTURING; BUT AS HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND, AND DOES NOT SEEM
TO FEEL THE COLD HIMSELF, I DO NOT LIKE TO INTERFERE, AS I KNOW IT
WOULD BE SO GREAT A DISAPPOINTMENT TO MR. AND MRS. WESTON.  BUT, UPON
MY WORD, MR. ELTON, IN YOUR CASE, I SHOULD CERTAINLY EXCUSE MYSELF.
YOU APPEAR TO ME A LITTLE HOARSE ALREADY, AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER
WHAT DEMAND OF VOICE AND WHAT FATIGUES TO-MORROW WILL BRING,
I THINK IT WOULD BE NO MORE THAN COMMON PRUDENCE TO STAY AT HOME
AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF TO-NIGHT."

MR. ELTON LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT VERY WELL KNOW WHAT ANSWER TO MAKE;
WHICH WAS EXACTLY THE CASE; FOR THOUGH VERY MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE KIND
CARE OF SUCH A FAIR LADY, AND NOT LIKING TO RESIST ANY ADVICE OF
HER'S, HE HAD NOT REALLY THE LEAST INCLINATION TO GIVE UP THE VISIT;--
BUT EMMA, TOO EAGER AND BUSY IN HER OWN PREVIOUS CONCEPTIONS
AND VIEWS TO HEAR HIM IMPARTIALLY, OR SEE HIM WITH CLEAR VISION,
WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS MUTTERING ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ITS
BEING "VERY COLD, CERTAINLY VERY COLD," AND WALKED ON, REJOICING IN
HAVING EXTRICATED HIM FROM RANDALLS, AND SECURED HIM THE POWER
OF SENDING TO INQUIRE AFTER HARRIET EVERY HOUR OF THE EVENING.

"YOU DO QUITE RIGHT," SAID SHE;--"WE WILL MAKE YOUR APOLOGIES
TO MR. AND MRS. WESTON."

BUT HARDLY HAD SHE SO SPOKEN, WHEN SHE FOUND HER BROTHER WAS CIVILLY
OFFERING A SEAT IN HIS CARRIAGE, IF THE WEATHER WERE MR. ELTON'S
ONLY OBJECTION, AND MR. ELTON ACTUALLY ACCEPTING THE OFFER WITH MUCH
PROMPT SATISFACTION.  IT WAS A DONE THING; MR. ELTON WAS TO GO,
AND NEVER HAD HIS BROAD HANDSOME FACE EXPRESSED MORE PLEASURE THAN
AT THIS MOMENT; NEVER HAD HIS SMILE BEEN STRONGER, NOR HIS EYES
MORE EXULTING THAN WHEN HE NEXT LOOKED AT HER.

"WELL," SAID SHE TO HERSELF, "THIS IS MOST STRANGE!--AFTER I
HAD GOT HIM OFF SO WELL, TO CHUSE TO GO INTO COMPANY, AND LEAVE
HARRIET ILL BEHIND!--MOST STRANGE INDEED!--BUT THERE IS, I BELIEVE,
IN MANY MEN, ESPECIALLY SINGLE MEN, SUCH AN INCLINATION--
SUCH A PASSION FOR DINING OUT--A DINNER ENGAGEMENT IS SO HIGH IN
THE CLASS OF THEIR PLEASURES, THEIR EMPLOYMENTS, THEIR DIGNITIES,
ALMOST THEIR DUTIES, THAT ANY THING GIVES WAY TO IT--AND THIS MUST
BE THE CASE WITH MR. ELTON; A MOST VALUABLE, AMIABLE, PLEASING YOUNG
MAN UNDOUBTEDLY, AND VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HARRIET; BUT STILL,
HE CANNOT REFUSE AN INVITATION, HE MUST DINE OUT WHEREVER HE IS ASKED.
WHAT A STRANGE THING LOVE IS! HE CAN SEE READY WIT IN HARRIET,
BUT WILL NOT DINE ALONE FOR HER."

SOON AFTERWARDS MR. ELTON QUITTED THEM, AND SHE COULD NOT BUT DO HIM
THE JUSTICE OF FEELING THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF SENTIMENT
IN HIS MANNER OF NAMING HARRIET AT PARTING; IN THE TONE OF HIS
VOICE WHILE ASSURING HER THAT HE SHOULD CALL AT MRS. GODDARD'S
FOR NEWS OF HER FAIR FRIEND, THE LAST THING BEFORE HE PREPARED
FOR THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING HER AGAIN, WHEN HE HOPED TO BE
ABLE TO GIVE A BETTER REPORT; AND HE SIGHED AND SMILED HIMSELF
OFF IN A WAY THAT LEFT THE BALANCE OF APPROBATION MUCH IN HIS FAVOUR.

AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF ENTIRE SILENCE BETWEEN THEM, JOHN KNIGHTLEY
BEGAN WITH--

"I NEVER IN MY LIFE SAW A MAN MORE INTENT ON BEING AGREEABLE THAN
MR. ELTON.  IT IS DOWNRIGHT LABOUR TO HIM WHERE LADIES ARE CONCERNED.
WITH MEN HE CAN BE RATIONAL AND UNAFFECTED, BUT WHEN HE HAS LADIES
TO PLEASE, EVERY FEATURE WORKS."

"MR. ELTON'S MANNERS ARE NOT PERFECT," REPLIED EMMA; "BUT WHERE THERE
IS A WISH TO PLEASE, ONE OUGHT TO OVERLOOK, AND ONE DOES OVERLOOK
A GREAT DEAL.  WHERE A MAN DOES HIS BEST WITH ONLY MODERATE POWERS,
HE WILL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OVER NEGLIGENT SUPERIORITY.  THERE IS
SUCH PERFECT GOOD-TEMPER AND GOOD-WILL IN MR. ELTON AS ONE CANNOT
BUT VALUE."

"YES," SAID MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY PRESENTLY, WITH SOME SLYNESS,
"HE SEEMS TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD-WILL TOWARDS YOU."

"ME!" SHE REPLIED WITH A SMILE OF ASTONISHMENT, "ARE YOU IMAGINING
ME TO BE MR. ELTON'S OBJECT?"

"SUCH AN IMAGINATION HAS CROSSED ME, I OWN, EMMA; AND IF IT NEVER
OCCURRED TO YOU BEFORE, YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION NOW."

"MR. ELTON IN LOVE WITH ME!--WHAT AN IDEA!"

"I DO NOT SAY IT IS SO; BUT YOU WILL DO WELL TO CONSIDER WHETHER
IT IS SO OR NOT, AND TO REGULATE YOUR BEHAVIOUR ACCORDINGLY.
I THINK YOUR MANNERS TO HIM ENCOURAGING.  I SPEAK AS A FRIEND,
EMMA.  YOU HAD BETTER LOOK ABOUT YOU, AND ASCERTAIN WHAT YOU DO,
AND WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO."

"I THANK YOU; BUT I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN.  MR. ELTON
AND I ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS, AND NOTHING MORE;" AND SHE WALKED ON,
AMUSING HERSELF IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BLUNDERS WHICH OFTEN
ARISE FROM A PARTIAL KNOWLEDGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES, OF THE MISTAKES
WHICH PEOPLE OF HIGH PRETENSIONS TO JUDGMENT ARE FOR EVER FALLING INTO;
AND NOT VERY WELL PLEASED WITH HER BROTHER FOR IMAGINING HER BLIND
AND IGNORANT, AND IN WANT OF COUNSEL.  HE SAID NO MORE.

MR. WOODHOUSE HAD SO COMPLETELY MADE UP HIS MIND TO THE VISIT,
THAT IN SPITE OF THE INCREASING COLDNESS, HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO IDEA
OF SHRINKING FROM IT, AND SET FORWARD AT LAST MOST PUNCTUALLY
WITH HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER IN HIS OWN CARRIAGE, WITH LESS APPARENT
CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE WEATHER THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS; TOO FULL
OF THE WONDER OF HIS OWN GOING, AND THE PLEASURE IT WAS TO AFFORD AT
RANDALLS TO SEE THAT IT WAS COLD, AND TOO WELL WRAPT UP TO FEEL IT.
THE COLD, HOWEVER, WAS SEVERE; AND BY THE TIME THE SECOND CARRIAGE
WAS IN MOTION, A FEW FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FINDING THEIR WAY DOWN,
AND THE SKY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING SO OVERCHARGED AS TO WANT ONLY
A MILDER AIR TO PRODUCE A VERY WHITE WORLD IN A VERY SHORT TIME.

EMMA SOON SAW THAT HER COMPANION WAS NOT IN THE HAPPIEST HUMOUR.
THE PREPARING AND THE GOING ABROAD IN SUCH WEATHER, WITH THE SACRIFICE
OF HIS CHILDREN AFTER DINNER, WERE EVILS, WERE DISAGREEABLES AT LEAST,
WHICH MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS LIKE; HE ANTICIPATED
NOTHING IN THE VISIT THAT COULD BE AT ALL WORTH THE PURCHASE;
AND THE WHOLE OF THEIR DRIVE TO THE VICARAGE WAS SPENT BY HIM IN
EXPRESSING HIS DISCONTENT.

"A MAN," SAID HE, "MUST HAVE A VERY GOOD OPINION OF HIMSELF WHEN
HE ASKS PEOPLE TO LEAVE THEIR OWN FIRESIDE, AND ENCOUNTER SUCH
A DAY AS THIS, FOR THE SAKE OF COMING TO SEE HIM.  HE MUST THINK
HIMSELF A MOST AGREEABLE FELLOW; I COULD NOT DO SUCH A THING.
IT IS THE GREATEST ABSURDITY--ACTUALLY SNOWING AT THIS MOMENT!--
THE FOLLY OF NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO BE COMFORTABLE AT HOME--AND THE
FOLLY OF PEOPLE'S NOT STAYING COMFORTABLY AT HOME WHEN THEY CAN!
IF WE WERE OBLIGED TO GO OUT SUCH AN EVENING AS THIS, BY ANY CALL OF
DUTY OR BUSINESS, WHAT A HARDSHIP WE SHOULD DEEM IT;--AND HERE ARE WE,
PROBABLY WITH RATHER THINNER CLOTHING THAN USUAL, SETTING FORWARD
VOLUNTARILY, WITHOUT EXCUSE, IN DEFIANCE OF THE VOICE OF NATURE,
WHICH TELLS MAN, IN EVERY THING GIVEN TO HIS VIEW OR HIS FEELINGS,
TO STAY AT HOME HIMSELF, AND KEEP ALL UNDER SHELTER THAT HE CAN;--
HERE ARE WE SETTING FORWARD TO SPEND FIVE DULL HOURS IN ANOTHER
MAN'S HOUSE, WITH NOTHING TO SAY OR TO HEAR THAT WAS NOT SAID
AND HEARD YESTERDAY, AND MAY NOT BE SAID AND HEARD AGAIN TO-MORROW.
GOING IN DISMAL WEATHER, TO RETURN PROBABLY IN WORSE;--FOUR HORSES
AND FOUR SERVANTS TAKEN OUT FOR NOTHING BUT TO CONVEY FIVE IDLE,
SHIVERING CREATURES INTO COLDER ROOMS AND WORSE COMPANY THAN THEY
MIGHT HAVE HAD AT HOME."

EMMA DID NOT FIND HERSELF EQUAL TO GIVE THE PLEASED ASSENT, WHICH NO DOUBT
HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RECEIVING, TO EMULATE THE "VERY TRUE, MY LOVE,"
WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN USUALLY ADMINISTERED BY HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION;
BUT SHE HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO REFRAIN FROM MAKING ANY ANSWER
AT ALL.  SHE COULD NOT BE COMPLYING, SHE DREADED BEING QUARRELSOME;
HER HEROISM REACHED ONLY TO SILENCE.  SHE ALLOWED HIM TO TALK,
AND ARRANGED THE GLASSES, AND WRAPPED HERSELF UP, WITHOUT OPENING
HER LIPS.

THEY ARRIVED, THE CARRIAGE TURNED, THE STEP WAS LET DOWN,
AND MR. ELTON, SPRUCE, BLACK, AND SMILING, WAS WITH THEM INSTANTLY.
EMMA THOUGHT WITH PLEASURE OF SOME CHANGE OF SUBJECT.  MR. ELTON
WAS ALL OBLIGATION AND CHEERFULNESS; HE WAS SO VERY CHEERFUL
IN HIS CIVILITIES INDEED, THAT SHE BEGAN TO THINK HE MUST HAVE
RECEIVED A DIFFERENT ACCOUNT OF HARRIET FROM WHAT HAD REACHED HER.
SHE HAD SENT WHILE DRESSING, AND THE ANSWER HAD BEEN, "MUCH THE SAME--
NOT BETTER."

"_MY_ REPORT FROM MRS. GODDARD'S," SAID SHE PRESENTLY, "WAS NOT
SO PLEASANT AS I HAD HOPED--`NOT BETTER' WAS _MY_ ANSWER."

HIS FACE LENGTHENED IMMEDIATELY; AND HIS VOICE WAS THE VOICE
OF SENTIMENT AS HE ANSWERED.

"OH! NO--I AM GRIEVED TO FIND--I WAS ON THE POINT OF TELLING YOU THAT
WHEN I CALLED AT MRS. GODDARD'S DOOR, WHICH I DID THE VERY LAST THING
BEFORE I RETURNED TO DRESS, I WAS TOLD THAT MISS SMITH WAS NOT BETTER,
BY NO MEANS BETTER, RATHER WORSE.  VERY MUCH GRIEVED AND CONCERNED--
I HAD FLATTERED MYSELF THAT SHE MUST BE BETTER AFTER SUCH A CORDIAL
AS I KNEW HAD BEEN GIVEN HER IN THE MORNING."

EMMA SMILED AND ANSWERED--"MY VISIT WAS OF USE TO THE NERVOUS PART
OF HER COMPLAINT, I HOPE; BUT NOT EVEN I CAN CHARM AWAY A SORE THROAT;
IT IS A MOST SEVERE COLD INDEED.  MR. PERRY HAS BEEN WITH HER,
AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD."

"YES--I IMAGINED--THAT IS--I DID NOT--"

"HE HAS BEEN USED TO HER IN THESE COMPLAINTS, AND I HOPE TO-MORROW
MORNING WILL BRING US BOTH A MORE COMFORTABLE REPORT.  BUT IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO FEEL UNEASINESS.  SUCH A SAD LOSS TO OUR PARTY TO-DAY!"

"DREADFUL!--EXACTLY SO, INDEED.--SHE WILL BE MISSED EVERY MOMENT."

THIS WAS VERY PROPER; THE SIGH WHICH ACCOMPANIED IT WAS REALLY ESTIMABLE;
BUT IT SHOULD HAVE LASTED LONGER.  EMMA WAS RATHER IN DISMAY WHEN
ONLY HALF A MINUTE AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF OTHER THINGS,
AND IN A VOICE OF THE GREATEST ALACRITY AND ENJOYMENT.

"WHAT AN EXCELLENT DEVICE," SAID HE, "THE USE OF A SHEEPSKIN
FOR CARRIAGES.  HOW VERY COMFORTABLE THEY MAKE IT;--IMPOSSIBLE TO
FEEL COLD WITH SUCH PRECAUTIONS.  THE CONTRIVANCES OF MODERN DAYS
INDEED HAVE RENDERED A GENTLEMAN'S CARRIAGE PERFECTLY COMPLETE.
ONE IS SO FENCED AND GUARDED FROM THE WEATHER, THAT NOT A BREATH
OF AIR CAN FIND ITS WAY UNPERMITTED.  WEATHER BECOMES ABSOLUTELY
OF NO CONSEQUENCE.  IT IS A VERY COLD AFTERNOON--BUT IN THIS CARRIAGE
WE KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER.--HA! SNOWS A LITTLE I SEE."

"YES," SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY, "AND I THINK WE SHALL HAVE A GOOD DEAL
OF IT."

"CHRISTMAS WEATHER," OBSERVED MR. ELTON.  "QUITE SEASONABLE;
AND EXTREMELY FORTUNATE WE MAY THINK OURSELVES THAT IT DID NOT
BEGIN YESTERDAY, AND PREVENT THIS DAY'S PARTY, WHICH IT MIGHT VERY
POSSIBLY HAVE DONE, FOR MR. WOODHOUSE WOULD HARDLY HAVE VENTURED HAD
THERE BEEN MUCH SNOW ON THE GROUND; BUT NOW IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE.
THIS IS QUITE THE SEASON INDEED FOR FRIENDLY MEETINGS.  AT CHRISTMAS
EVERY BODY INVITES THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT THEM, AND PEOPLE THINK LITTLE
OF EVEN THE WORST WEATHER.  I WAS SNOWED UP AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE ONCE
FOR A WEEK.  NOTHING COULD BE PLEASANTER.  I WENT FOR ONLY ONE NIGHT,
AND COULD NOT GET AWAY TILL THAT VERY DAY SE'NNIGHT."

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT COMPREHEND THE PLEASURE,
BUT SAID ONLY, COOLLY,

"I CANNOT WISH TO BE SNOWED UP A WEEK AT RANDALLS."

AT ANOTHER TIME EMMA MIGHT HAVE BEEN AMUSED, BUT SHE WAS TOO
MUCH ASTONISHED NOW AT MR. ELTON'S SPIRITS FOR OTHER FEELINGS.
HARRIET SEEMED QUITE FORGOTTEN IN THE EXPECTATION OF A PLEASANT PARTY.

"WE ARE SURE OF EXCELLENT FIRES," CONTINUED HE, "AND EVERY THING
IN THE GREATEST COMFORT.  CHARMING PEOPLE, MR. AND MRS. WESTON;--
MRS. WESTON INDEED IS MUCH BEYOND PRAISE, AND HE IS EXACTLY
WHAT ONE VALUES, SO HOSPITABLE, AND SO FOND OF SOCIETY;--
IT WILL BE A SMALL PARTY, BUT WHERE SMALL PARTIES ARE SELECT,
THEY ARE PERHAPS THE MOST AGREEABLE OF ANY.  MR. WESTON'S DINING-ROOM
DOES NOT ACCOMMODATE MORE THAN TEN COMFORTABLY; AND FOR MY PART,
I WOULD RATHER, UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, FALL SHORT BY TWO THAN
EXCEED BY TWO.  I THINK YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME, (TURNING WITH A SOFT
AIR TO EMMA,) I THINK I SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE YOUR APPROBATION,
THOUGH MR. KNIGHTLEY PERHAPS, FROM BEING USED TO THE LARGE PARTIES
OF LONDON, MAY NOT QUITE ENTER INTO OUR FEELINGS."

"I KNOW NOTHING OF THE LARGE PARTIES OF LONDON, SIR--I NEVER DINE
WITH ANY BODY."

"INDEED! (IN A TONE OF WONDER AND PITY,) I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE
LAW HAD BEEN SO GREAT A SLAVERY.  WELL, SIR, THE TIME MUST COME
WHEN YOU WILL BE PAID FOR ALL THIS, WHEN YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE
LABOUR AND GREAT ENJOYMENT."

"MY FIRST ENJOYMENT," REPLIED JOHN KNIGHTLEY, AS THEY PASSED THROUGH
THE SWEEP-GATE, "WILL BE TO FIND MYSELF SAFE AT HARTFIELD AGAIN."



CHAPTER XIV


SOME CHANGE OF COUNTENANCE WAS NECESSARY FOR EACH GENTLEMAN
AS THEY WALKED INTO MRS. WESTON'S DRAWING-ROOM;--MR. ELTON MUST
COMPOSE HIS JOYOUS LOOKS, AND MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY DISPERSE HIS
ILL-HUMOUR. MR. ELTON MUST SMILE LESS, AND MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY MORE,
TO FIT THEM FOR THE PLACE.--EMMA ONLY MIGHT BE AS NATURE PROMPTED,
AND SHEW HERSELF JUST AS HAPPY AS SHE WAS.  TO HER IT WAS REAL
ENJOYMENT TO BE WITH THE WESTONS.  MR. WESTON WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE,
AND THERE WAS NOT A CREATURE IN THE WORLD TO WHOM SHE SPOKE WITH
SUCH UNRESERVE, AS TO HIS WIFE; NOT ANY ONE, TO WHOM SHE RELATED
WITH SUCH CONVICTION OF BEING LISTENED TO AND UNDERSTOOD, OF BEING
ALWAYS INTERESTING AND ALWAYS INTELLIGIBLE, THE LITTLE AFFAIRS,
ARRANGEMENTS, PERPLEXITIES, AND PLEASURES OF HER FATHER AND HERSELF.
SHE COULD TELL NOTHING OF HARTFIELD, IN WHICH MRS. WESTON HAD NOT
A LIVELY CONCERN; AND HALF AN HOUR'S UNINTERRUPTED COMMUNICATION
OF ALL THOSE LITTLE MATTERS ON WHICH THE DAILY HAPPINESS OF PRIVATE
LIFE DEPENDS, WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GRATIFICATIONS OF EACH.

THIS WAS A PLEASURE WHICH PERHAPS THE WHOLE DAY'S VISIT MIGHT
NOT AFFORD, WHICH CERTAINLY DID NOT BELONG TO THE PRESENT HALF-HOUR;
BUT THE VERY SIGHT OF MRS. WESTON, HER SMILE, HER TOUCH, HER VOICE
WAS GRATEFUL TO EMMA, AND SHE DETERMINED TO THINK AS LITTLE AS
POSSIBLE OF MR. ELTON'S ODDITIES, OR OF ANY THING ELSE UNPLEASANT,
AND ENJOY ALL THAT WAS ENJOYABLE TO THE UTMOST.

THE MISFORTUNE OF HARRIET'S COLD HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL GONE THROUGH
BEFORE HER ARRIVAL.  MR. WOODHOUSE HAD BEEN SAFELY SEATED LONG
ENOUGH TO GIVE THE HISTORY OF IT, BESIDES ALL THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN
AND ISABELLA'S COMING, AND OF EMMA'S BEING TO FOLLOW, AND HAD INDEED
JUST GOT TO THE END OF HIS SATISFACTION THAT JAMES SHOULD COME
AND SEE HIS DAUGHTER, WHEN THE OTHERS APPEARED, AND MRS. WESTON,
WHO HAD BEEN ALMOST WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY HER ATTENTIONS TO HIM,
WAS ABLE TO TURN AWAY AND WELCOME HER DEAR EMMA.

EMMA'S PROJECT OF FORGETTING MR. ELTON FOR A WHILE MADE HER RATHER
SORRY TO FIND, WHEN THEY HAD ALL TAKEN THEIR PLACES, THAT HE WAS
CLOSE TO HER.  THE DIFFICULTY WAS GREAT OF DRIVING HIS STRANGE
INSENSIBILITY TOWARDS HARRIET, FROM HER MIND, WHILE HE NOT ONLY SAT
AT HER ELBOW, BUT WAS CONTINUALLY OBTRUDING HIS HAPPY COUNTENANCE
ON HER NOTICE, AND SOLICITOUSLY ADDRESSING HER UPON EVERY OCCASION.
INSTEAD OF FORGETTING HIM, HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SUCH THAT SHE COULD
NOT AVOID THE INTERNAL SUGGESTION OF "CAN IT REALLY BE AS MY BROTHER
IMAGINED? CAN IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THIS MAN TO BE BEGINNING TO TRANSFER
HIS AFFECTIONS FROM HARRIET TO ME?--ABSURD AND INSUFFERABLE!"--
YET HE WOULD BE SO ANXIOUS FOR HER BEING PERFECTLY WARM, WOULD BE
SO INTERESTED ABOUT HER FATHER, AND SO DELIGHTED WITH MRS. WESTON;
AND AT LAST WOULD BEGIN ADMIRING HER DRAWINGS WITH SO MUCH ZEAL
AND SO LITTLE KNOWLEDGE AS SEEMED TERRIBLY LIKE A WOULD-BE LOVER,
AND MADE IT SOME EFFORT WITH HER TO PRESERVE HER GOOD MANNERS.
FOR HER OWN SAKE SHE COULD NOT BE RUDE; AND FOR HARRIET'S, IN THE HOPE
THAT ALL WOULD YET TURN OUT RIGHT, SHE WAS EVEN POSITIVELY CIVIL;
BUT IT WAS AN EFFORT; ESPECIALLY AS SOMETHING WAS GOING ON AMONGST
THE OTHERS, IN THE MOST OVERPOWERING PERIOD OF MR. ELTON'S NONSENSE,
WHICH SHE PARTICULARLY WISHED TO LISTEN TO.  SHE HEARD ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT MR. WESTON WAS GIVING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT HIS SON;
SHE HEARD THE WORDS "MY SON," AND "FRANK," AND "MY SON,"
REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES OVER; AND, FROM A FEW OTHER HALF-SYLLABLES
VERY MUCH SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS ANNOUNCING AN EARLY VISIT FROM
HIS SON; BUT BEFORE SHE COULD QUIET MR. ELTON, THE SUBJECT WAS
SO COMPLETELY PAST THAT ANY REVIVING QUESTION FROM HER WOULD HAVE
BEEN AWKWARD.

NOW, IT SO HAPPENED THAT IN SPITE OF EMMA'S RESOLUTION OF NEVER MARRYING,
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE NAME, IN THE IDEA OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL,
WHICH ALWAYS INTERESTED HER.  SHE HAD FREQUENTLY THOUGHT--ESPECIALLY SINCE
HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE WITH MISS TAYLOR--THAT IF SHE _WERE_ TO MARRY,
HE WAS THE VERY PERSON TO SUIT HER IN AGE, CHARACTER AND CONDITION.
HE SEEMED BY THIS CONNEXION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES, QUITE TO BELONG TO HER.
SHE COULD NOT BUT SUPPOSE IT TO BE A MATCH THAT EVERY BODY WHO KNEW
THEM MUST THINK OF.  THAT MR. AND MRS. WESTON DID THINK OF IT, SHE WAS
VERY STRONGLY PERSUADED; AND THOUGH NOT MEANING TO BE INDUCED BY HIM,
OR BY ANY BODY ELSE, TO GIVE UP A SITUATION WHICH SHE BELIEVED MORE
REPLETE WITH GOOD THAN ANY SHE COULD CHANGE IT FOR, SHE HAD A GREAT
CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM, A DECIDED INTENTION OF FINDING HIM PLEASANT,
OF BEING LIKED BY HIM TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, AND A SORT OF PLEASURE
IN THE IDEA OF THEIR BEING COUPLED IN THEIR FRIENDS' IMAGINATIONS.

WITH SUCH SENSATIONS, MR. ELTON'S CIVILITIES WERE DREADFULLY ILL-TIMED;
BUT SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF APPEARING VERY POLITE, WHILE FEELING
VERY CROSS--AND OF THINKING THAT THE REST OF THE VISIT COULD NOT
POSSIBLY PASS WITHOUT BRINGING FORWARD THE SAME INFORMATION AGAIN,
OR THE SUBSTANCE OF IT, FROM THE OPEN-HEARTED MR. WESTON.--SO IT PROVED;--
FOR WHEN HAPPILY RELEASED FROM MR. ELTON, AND SEATED BY MR. WESTON,
AT DINNER, HE MADE USE OF THE VERY FIRST INTERVAL IN THE CARES
OF HOSPITALITY, THE VERY FIRST LEISURE FROM THE SADDLE OF MUTTON,
TO SAY TO HER,

"WE WANT ONLY TWO MORE TO BE JUST THE RIGHT NUMBER.  I SHOULD
LIKE TO SEE TWO MORE HERE,--YOUR PRETTY LITTLE FRIEND, MISS SMITH,
AND MY SON--AND THEN I SHOULD SAY WE WERE QUITE COMPLETE.
I BELIEVE YOU DID NOT HEAR ME TELLING THE OTHERS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
THAT WE ARE EXPECTING FRANK.  I HAD A LETTER FROM HIM THIS MORNING,
AND HE WILL BE WITH US WITHIN A FORTNIGHT."

EMMA SPOKE WITH A VERY PROPER DEGREE OF PLEASURE; AND FULLY ASSENTED
TO HIS PROPOSITION OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS SMITH MAKING
THEIR PARTY QUITE COMPLETE.

"HE HAS BEEN WANTING TO COME TO US," CONTINUED MR. WESTON,
"EVER SINCE SEPTEMBER:  EVERY LETTER HAS BEEN FULL OF IT;
BUT HE CANNOT COMMAND HIS OWN TIME.  HE HAS THOSE TO PLEASE
WHO MUST BE PLEASED, AND WHO (BETWEEN OURSELVES) ARE SOMETIMES
TO BE PLEASED ONLY BY A GOOD MANY SACRIFICES.  BUT NOW
I HAVE NO DOUBT OF SEEING HIM HERE ABOUT THE SECOND WEEK IN JANUARY."

"WHAT A VERY GREAT PLEASURE IT WILL BE TO YOU! AND MRS. WESTON
IS SO ANXIOUS TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM, THAT SHE MUST BE ALMOST
AS HAPPY AS YOURSELF."

"YES, SHE WOULD BE, BUT THAT SHE THINKS THERE WILL BE ANOTHER
PUT-OFF. SHE DOES NOT DEPEND UPON HIS COMING SO MUCH AS I DO:
BUT SHE DOES NOT KNOW THE PARTIES SO WELL AS I DO.  THE CASE,
YOU SEE, IS--(BUT THIS IS QUITE BETWEEN OURSELVES:  I DID NOT MENTION
A SYLLABLE OF IT IN THE OTHER ROOM.  THERE ARE SECRETS IN ALL FAMILIES,
YOU KNOW)--THE CASE IS, THAT A PARTY OF FRIENDS ARE INVITED TO PAY
A VISIT AT ENSCOMBE IN JANUARY; AND THAT FRANK'S COMING DEPENDS UPON
THEIR BEING PUT OFF.  IF THEY ARE NOT PUT OFF, HE CANNOT STIR.
BUT I KNOW THEY WILL, BECAUSE IT IS A FAMILY THAT A CERTAIN LADY,
OF SOME CONSEQUENCE, AT ENSCOMBE, HAS A PARTICULAR DISLIKE TO:
AND THOUGH IT IS THOUGHT NECESSARY TO INVITE THEM ONCE IN TWO OR
THREE YEARS, THEY ALWAYS ARE PUT OFF WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT.
I HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT OF THE ISSUE.  I AM AS CONFIDENT
OF SEEING FRANK HERE BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY, AS I AM
OF BEING HERE MYSELF:  BUT YOUR GOOD FRIEND THERE (NODDING
TOWARDS THE UPPER END OF THE TABLE) HAS SO FEW VAGARIES HERSELF,
AND HAS BEEN SO LITTLE USED TO THEM AT HARTFIELD, THAT SHE CANNOT
CALCULATE ON THEIR EFFECTS, AS I HAVE BEEN LONG IN THE PRACTICE
OF DOING."

"I AM SORRY THERE SHOULD BE ANY THING LIKE DOUBT IN THE CASE,"
REPLIED EMMA; "BUT AM DISPOSED TO SIDE WITH YOU, MR. WESTON.  IF YOU
THINK HE WILL COME, I SHALL THINK SO TOO; FOR YOU KNOW ENSCOMBE."

"YES--I HAVE SOME RIGHT TO THAT KNOWLEDGE; THOUGH I HAVE NEVER BEEN
AT THE PLACE IN MY LIFE.--SHE IS AN ODD WOMAN!--BUT I NEVER ALLOW
MYSELF TO SPEAK ILL OF HER, ON FRANK'S ACCOUNT; FOR I DO BELIEVE
HER TO BE VERY FOND OF HIM.  I USED TO THINK SHE WAS NOT CAPABLE
OF BEING FOND OF ANY BODY, EXCEPT HERSELF:  BUT SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
KIND TO HIM (IN HER WAY--ALLOWING FOR LITTLE WHIMS AND CAPRICES,
AND EXPECTING EVERY THING TO BE AS SHE LIKES). AND IT IS NO SMALL CREDIT,
IN MY OPINION, TO HIM, THAT HE SHOULD EXCITE SUCH AN AFFECTION;
FOR, THOUGH I WOULD NOT SAY IT TO ANY BODY ELSE, SHE HAS NO MORE
HEART THAN A STONE TO PEOPLE IN GENERAL; AND THE DEVIL OF A TEMPER."

EMMA LIKED THE SUBJECT SO WELL, THAT SHE BEGAN UPON IT, TO MRS. WESTON,
VERY SOON AFTER THEIR MOVING INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM: WISHING HER JOY--
YET OBSERVING, THAT SHE KNEW THE FIRST MEETING MUST BE RATHER ALARMING.--
MRS. WESTON AGREED TO IT; BUT ADDED, THAT SHE SHOULD BE VERY
GLAD TO BE SECURE OF UNDERGOING THE ANXIETY OF A FIRST MEETING
AT THE TIME TALKED OF:  "FOR I CANNOT DEPEND UPON HIS COMING.
I CANNOT BE SO SANGUINE AS MR. WESTON.  I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID
THAT IT WILL ALL END IN NOTHING.  MR. WESTON, I DARE SAY, HAS BEEN
TELLING YOU EXACTLY HOW THE MATTER STANDS?"

"YES--IT SEEMS TO DEPEND UPON NOTHING BUT THE ILL-HUMOUR
OF MRS. CHURCHILL, WHICH I IMAGINE TO BE THE MOST CERTAIN
THING IN THE WORLD."

"MY EMMA!" REPLIED MRS. WESTON, SMILING, "WHAT IS THE CERTAINTY
OF CAPRICE?"  THEN TURNING TO ISABELLA, WHO HAD NOT BEEN
ATTENDING BEFORE--"YOU MUST KNOW, MY DEAR MRS. KNIGHTLEY,
THAT WE ARE BY NO MEANS SO SURE OF SEEING MR. FRANK CHURCHILL,
IN MY OPINION, AS HIS FATHER THINKS.  IT DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON
HIS AUNT'S SPIRITS AND PLEASURE; IN SHORT, UPON HER TEMPER.
TO YOU--TO MY TWO DAUGHTERS--I MAY VENTURE ON THE TRUTH.
MRS. CHURCHILL RULES AT ENSCOMBE, AND IS A VERY ODD-TEMPERED WOMAN;
AND HIS COMING NOW, DEPENDS UPON HER BEING WILLING TO SPARE HIM."

"OH, MRS. CHURCHILL; EVERY BODY KNOWS MRS. CHURCHILL,"
REPLIED ISABELLA:  "AND I AM SURE I NEVER THINK OF THAT POOR YOUNG
MAN WITHOUT THE GREATEST COMPASSION.  TO BE CONSTANTLY LIVING
WITH AN ILL-TEMPERED PERSON, MUST BE DREADFUL.  IT IS WHAT WE
HAPPILY HAVE NEVER KNOWN ANY THING OF; BUT IT MUST BE A LIFE
OF MISERY.  WHAT A BLESSING, THAT SHE NEVER HAD ANY CHILDREN!
POOR LITTLE CREATURES, HOW UNHAPPY SHE WOULD HAVE MADE THEM!"

EMMA WISHED SHE HAD BEEN ALONE WITH MRS. WESTON.  SHE SHOULD THEN HAVE
HEARD MORE:  MRS. WESTON WOULD SPEAK TO HER, WITH A DEGREE OF UNRESERVE
WHICH SHE WOULD NOT HAZARD WITH ISABELLA; AND, SHE REALLY BELIEVED,
WOULD SCARCELY TRY TO CONCEAL ANY THING RELATIVE TO THE CHURCHILLS
FROM HER, EXCEPTING THOSE VIEWS ON THE YOUNG MAN, OF WHICH HER OWN
IMAGINATION HAD ALREADY GIVEN HER SUCH INSTINCTIVE KNOWLEDGE.
BUT AT PRESENT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID.  MR. WOODHOUSE
VERY SOON FOLLOWED THEM INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM. TO BE SITTING
LONG AFTER DINNER, WAS A CONFINEMENT THAT HE COULD NOT ENDURE.
NEITHER WINE NOR CONVERSATION WAS ANY THING TO HIM; AND GLADLY DID
HE MOVE TO THOSE WITH WHOM HE WAS ALWAYS COMFORTABLE.

WHILE HE TALKED TO ISABELLA, HOWEVER, EMMA FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY
OF SAYING,

"AND SO YOU DO NOT CONSIDER THIS VISIT FROM YOUR SON AS BY ANY
MEANS CERTAIN.  I AM SORRY FOR IT.  THE INTRODUCTION MUST BE UNPLEASANT,
WHENEVER IT TAKES PLACE; AND THE SOONER IT COULD BE OVER, THE BETTER."

"YES; AND EVERY DELAY MAKES ONE MORE APPREHENSIVE OF OTHER DELAYS.
EVEN IF THIS FAMILY, THE BRAITHWAITES, ARE PUT OFF, I AM STILL
AFRAID THAT SOME EXCUSE MAY BE FOUND FOR DISAPPOINTING US.
I CANNOT BEAR TO IMAGINE ANY RELUCTANCE ON HIS SIDE; BUT I AM SURE
THERE IS A GREAT WISH ON THE CHURCHILLS' TO KEEP HIM TO THEMSELVES.
THERE IS JEALOUSY.  THEY ARE JEALOUS EVEN OF HIS REGARD FOR HIS FATHER.
IN SHORT, I CAN FEEL NO DEPENDENCE ON HIS COMING, AND I WISH MR. WESTON
WERE LESS SANGUINE."

"HE OUGHT TO COME," SAID EMMA.  "IF HE COULD STAY ONLY A COUPLE
OF DAYS, HE OUGHT TO COME; AND ONE CAN HARDLY CONCEIVE A YOUNG MAN'S
NOT HAVING IT IN HIS POWER TO DO AS MUCH AS THAT.  A YOUNG _WOMAN_,
IF SHE FALL INTO BAD HANDS, MAY BE TEAZED, AND KEPT AT A DISTANCE
FROM THOSE SHE WANTS TO BE WITH; BUT ONE CANNOT COMPREHEND A YOUNG
_MAN_'S BEING UNDER SUCH RESTRAINT, AS NOT TO BE ABLE TO SPEND A WEEK
WITH HIS FATHER, IF HE LIKES IT."

"ONE OUGHT TO BE AT ENSCOMBE, AND KNOW THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY,
BEFORE ONE DECIDES UPON WHAT HE CAN DO," REPLIED MRS. WESTON.
"ONE OUGHT TO USE THE SAME CAUTION, PERHAPS, IN JUDGING OF THE
CONDUCT OF ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL OF ANY ONE FAMILY; BUT ENSCOMBE,
I BELIEVE, CERTAINLY MUST NOT BE JUDGED BY GENERAL RULES:
_SHE_ IS SO VERY UNREASONABLE; AND EVERY THING GIVES WAY TO HER."

"BUT SHE IS SO FOND OF THE NEPHEW:  HE IS SO VERY GREAT A FAVOURITE.
NOW, ACCORDING TO MY IDEA OF MRS. CHURCHILL, IT WOULD BE MOST NATURAL,
THAT WHILE SHE MAKES NO SACRIFICE FOR THE COMFORT OF THE HUSBAND,
TO WHOM SHE OWES EVERY THING, WHILE SHE EXERCISES INCESSANT CAPRICE
TOWARDS _HIM_, SHE SHOULD FREQUENTLY BE GOVERNED BY THE NEPHEW,
TO WHOM SHE OWES NOTHING AT ALL."

"MY DEAREST EMMA, DO NOT PRETEND, WITH YOUR SWEET TEMPER,
TO UNDERSTAND A BAD ONE, OR TO LAY DOWN RULES FOR IT:  YOU MUST
LET IT GO ITS OWN WAY.  I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HIS HAVING, AT TIMES,
CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE; BUT IT MAY BE PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM
TO KNOW BEFOREHAND _WHEN_ IT WILL BE."

EMMA LISTENED, AND THEN COOLLY SAID, "I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED,
UNLESS HE COMES."

"HE MAY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE ON SOME POINTS,"
CONTINUED MRS. WESTON, "AND ON OTHERS, VERY LITTLE:  AND AMONG THOSE,
ON WHICH SHE IS BEYOND HIS REACH, IT IS BUT TOO LIKELY, MAY BE
THIS VERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS COMING AWAY FROM THEM TO VISIT US."



CHAPTER XV


MR. WOODHOUSE WAS SOON READY FOR HIS TEA; AND WHEN HE HAD DRANK HIS
TEA HE WAS QUITE READY TO GO HOME; AND IT WAS AS MUCH AS HIS THREE
COMPANIONS COULD DO, TO ENTERTAIN AWAY HIS NOTICE OF THE LATENESS
OF THE HOUR, BEFORE THE OTHER GENTLEMEN APPEARED.  MR. WESTON WAS
CHATTY AND CONVIVIAL, AND NO FRIEND TO EARLY SEPARATIONS OF ANY SORT;
BUT AT LAST THE DRAWING-ROOM PARTY DID RECEIVE AN AUGMENTATION.
MR. ELTON, IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS, WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO WALK IN.
MRS. WESTON AND EMMA WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A SOFA.  HE JOINED
THEM IMMEDIATELY, AND, WITH SCARCELY AN INVITATION, SEATED HIMSELF
BETWEEN THEM.

EMMA, IN GOOD SPIRITS TOO, FROM THE AMUSEMENT AFFORDED HER MIND
BY THE EXPECTATION OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, WAS WILLING TO FORGET
HIS LATE IMPROPRIETIES, AND BE AS WELL SATISFIED WITH HIM AS BEFORE,
AND ON HIS MAKING HARRIET HIS VERY FIRST SUBJECT, WAS READY TO LISTEN
WITH MOST FRIENDLY SMILES.

HE PROFESSED HIMSELF EXTREMELY ANXIOUS ABOUT HER FAIR FRIEND--
HER FAIR, LOVELY, AMIABLE FRIEND.  "DID SHE KNOW?--HAD SHE
HEARD ANY THING ABOUT HER, SINCE THEIR BEING AT RANDALLS?--
HE FELT MUCH ANXIETY--HE MUST CONFESS THAT THE NATURE OF HER
COMPLAINT ALARMED HIM CONSIDERABLY."  AND IN THIS STYLE HE TALKED
ON FOR SOME TIME VERY PROPERLY, NOT MUCH ATTENDING TO ANY ANSWER,
BUT ALTOGETHER SUFFICIENTLY AWAKE TO THE TERROR OF A BAD SORE THROAT;
AND EMMA WAS QUITE IN CHARITY WITH HIM.

BUT AT LAST THERE SEEMED A PERVERSE TURN; IT SEEMED ALL AT ONCE AS IF
HE WERE MORE AFRAID OF ITS BEING A BAD SORE THROAT ON HER ACCOUNT,
THAN ON HARRIET'S--MORE ANXIOUS THAT SHE SHOULD ESCAPE THE INFECTION,
THAN THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO INFECTION IN THE COMPLAINT.  HE BEGAN
WITH GREAT EARNESTNESS TO ENTREAT HER TO REFRAIN FROM VISITING
THE SICK-CHAMBER AGAIN, FOR THE PRESENT--TO ENTREAT HER TO _PROMISE_
_HIM_ NOT TO VENTURE INTO SUCH HAZARD TILL HE HAD SEEN MR. PERRY
AND LEARNT HIS OPINION; AND THOUGH SHE TRIED TO LAUGH IT OFF
AND BRING THE SUBJECT BACK INTO ITS PROPER COURSE, THERE WAS NO
PUTTING AN END TO HIS EXTREME SOLICITUDE ABOUT HER.  SHE WAS VEXED.
IT DID APPEAR--THERE WAS NO CONCEALING IT--EXACTLY LIKE THE PRETENCE
OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HER, INSTEAD OF HARRIET; AN INCONSTANCY,
IF REAL, THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE AND ABOMINABLE! AND SHE HAD DIFFICULTY
IN BEHAVING WITH TEMPER.  HE TURNED TO MRS. WESTON TO IMPLORE
HER ASSISTANCE, "WOULD NOT SHE GIVE HIM HER SUPPORT?--WOULD NOT SHE
ADD HER PERSUASIONS TO HIS, TO INDUCE MISS WOODHOUSE NOT TO GO
TO MRS. GODDARD'S TILL IT WERE CERTAIN THAT MISS SMITH'S DISORDER
HAD NO INFECTION?  HE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT A PROMISE--
WOULD NOT SHE GIVE HIM HER INFLUENCE IN PROCURING IT?"

"SO SCRUPULOUS FOR OTHERS," HE CONTINUED, "AND YET SO CARELESS
FOR HERSELF!  SHE WANTED ME TO NURSE MY COLD BY STAYING AT HOME TO-DAY,
AND YET WILL NOT PROMISE TO AVOID THE DANGER OF CATCHING AN ULCERATED
SORE THROAT HERSELF.  IS THIS FAIR, MRS. WESTON?--JUDGE BETWEEN US.
HAVE NOT I SOME RIGHT TO COMPLAIN?  I AM SURE OF YOUR KIND SUPPORT
AND AID."

EMMA SAW MRS. WESTON'S SURPRIZE, AND FELT THAT IT MUST BE GREAT,
AT AN ADDRESS WHICH, IN WORDS AND MANNER, WAS ASSUMING TO HIMSELF
THE RIGHT OF FIRST INTEREST IN HER; AND AS FOR HERSELF, SHE WAS
TOO MUCH PROVOKED AND OFFENDED TO HAVE THE POWER OF DIRECTLY
SAYING ANY THING TO THE PURPOSE.  SHE COULD ONLY GIVE HIM A LOOK;
BUT IT WAS SUCH A LOOK AS SHE THOUGHT MUST RESTORE HIM TO HIS SENSES,
AND THEN LEFT THE SOFA, REMOVING TO A SEAT BY HER SISTER, AND GIVING
HER ALL HER ATTENTION.

SHE HAD NOT TIME TO KNOW HOW MR. ELTON TOOK THE REPROOF, SO RAPIDLY
DID ANOTHER SUBJECT SUCCEED; FOR MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY NOW CAME
INTO THE ROOM FROM EXAMINING THE WEATHER, AND OPENED ON THEM
ALL WITH THE INFORMATION OF THE GROUND BEING COVERED WITH SNOW,
AND OF ITS STILL SNOWING FAST, WITH A STRONG DRIFTING WIND;
CONCLUDING WITH THESE WORDS TO MR. WOODHOUSE:

"THIS WILL PROVE A SPIRITED BEGINNING OF YOUR WINTER ENGAGEMENTS,
SIR.  SOMETHING NEW FOR YOUR COACHMAN AND HORSES TO BE MAKING
THEIR WAY THROUGH A STORM OF SNOW."

POOR MR. WOODHOUSE WAS SILENT FROM CONSTERNATION; BUT EVERY BODY ELSE
HAD SOMETHING TO SAY; EVERY BODY WAS EITHER SURPRIZED OR NOT SURPRIZED,
AND HAD SOME QUESTION TO ASK, OR SOME COMFORT TO OFFER.  MRS. WESTON
AND EMMA TRIED EARNESTLY TO CHEER HIM AND TURN HIS ATTENTION
FROM HIS SON-IN-LAW, WHO WAS PURSUING HIS TRIUMPH RATHER UNFEELINGLY.

"I ADMIRED YOUR RESOLUTION VERY MUCH, SIR," SAID HE, "IN VENTURING
OUT IN SUCH WEATHER, FOR OF COURSE YOU SAW THERE WOULD BE SNOW
VERY SOON.  EVERY BODY MUST HAVE SEEN THE SNOW COMING ON.
I ADMIRED YOUR SPIRIT; AND I DARE SAY WE SHALL GET HOME VERY WELL.
ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO'S SNOW CAN HARDLY MAKE THE ROAD IMPASSABLE;
AND WE ARE TWO CARRIAGES; IF ONE IS BLOWN OVER IN THE BLEAK PART
OF THE COMMON FIELD THERE WILL BE THE OTHER AT HAND.  I DARE SAY WE
SHALL BE ALL SAFE AT HARTFIELD BEFORE MIDNIGHT."

MR. WESTON, WITH TRIUMPH OF A DIFFERENT SORT, WAS CONFESSING THAT HE
HAD KNOWN IT TO BE SNOWING SOME TIME, BUT HAD NOT SAID A WORD,
LEST IT SHOULD MAKE MR. WOODHOUSE UNCOMFORTABLE, AND BE AN EXCUSE
FOR HIS HURRYING AWAY.  AS TO THERE BEING ANY QUANTITY OF SNOW FALLEN
OR LIKELY TO FALL TO IMPEDE THEIR RETURN, THAT WAS A MERE JOKE;
HE WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD FIND NO DIFFICULTY.  HE WISHED THE ROAD MIGHT
BE IMPASSABLE, THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM ALL AT RANDALLS;
AND WITH THE UTMOST GOOD-WILL WAS SURE THAT ACCOMMODATION MIGHT
BE FOUND FOR EVERY BODY, CALLING ON HIS WIFE TO AGREE WITH HIM,
THAT WITH A LITTLE CONTRIVANCE, EVERY BODY MIGHT BE LODGED,
WHICH SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO DO, FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THERE
BEING BUT TWO SPARE ROOMS IN THE HOUSE.

"WHAT IS TO BE DONE, MY DEAR EMMA?--WHAT IS TO BE DONE?"
WAS MR. WOODHOUSE'S FIRST EXCLAMATION, AND ALL THAT HE COULD SAY
FOR SOME TIME.  TO HER HE LOOKED FOR COMFORT; AND HER ASSURANCES
OF SAFETY, HER REPRESENTATION OF THE EXCELLENCE OF THE HORSES,
AND OF JAMES, AND OF THEIR HAVING SO MANY FRIENDS ABOUT THEM,
REVIVED HIM A LITTLE.

HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER'S ALARM WAS EQUAL TO HIS OWN.  THE HORROR OF
BEING BLOCKED UP AT RANDALLS, WHILE HER CHILDREN WERE AT HARTFIELD,
WAS FULL IN HER IMAGINATION; AND FANCYING THE ROAD TO BE NOW JUST
PASSABLE FOR ADVENTUROUS PEOPLE, BUT IN A STATE THAT ADMITTED NO DELAY,
SHE WAS EAGER TO HAVE IT SETTLED, THAT HER FATHER AND EMMA SHOULD REMAIN
AT RANDALLS, WHILE SHE AND HER HUSBAND SET FORWARD INSTANTLY THROUGH
ALL THE POSSIBLE ACCUMULATIONS OF DRIFTED SNOW THAT MIGHT IMPEDE THEM.

"YOU HAD BETTER ORDER THE CARRIAGE DIRECTLY, MY LOVE," SAID SHE;
"I DARE SAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO GET ALONG, IF WE SET OFF DIRECTLY;
AND IF WE DO COME TO ANY THING VERY BAD, I CAN GET OUT AND WALK.
I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID.  I SHOULD NOT MIND WALKING HALF THE WAY.
I COULD CHANGE MY SHOES, YOU KNOW, THE MOMENT I GOT HOME; AND IT IS NOT
THE SORT OF THING THAT GIVES ME COLD."

"INDEED!" REPLIED HE.  "THEN, MY DEAR ISABELLA, IT IS THE MOST
EXTRAORDINARY SORT OF THING IN THE WORLD, FOR IN GENERAL EVERY
THING DOES GIVE YOU COLD.  WALK HOME!--YOU ARE PRETTILY SHOD
FOR WALKING HOME, I DARE SAY.  IT WILL BE BAD ENOUGH FOR THE HORSES."

ISABELLA TURNED TO MRS. WESTON FOR HER APPROBATION OF THE PLAN.
MRS. WESTON COULD ONLY APPROVE.  ISABELLA THEN WENT TO EMMA;
BUT EMMA COULD NOT SO ENTIRELY GIVE UP THE HOPE OF THEIR BEING
ALL ABLE TO GET AWAY; AND THEY WERE STILL DISCUSSING THE POINT,
WHEN MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHO HAD LEFT THE ROOM IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS
BROTHER'S FIRST REPORT OF THE SNOW, CAME BACK AGAIN, AND TOLD THEM
THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT OF DOORS TO EXAMINE, AND COULD ANSWER FOR THERE
NOT BEING THE SMALLEST DIFFICULTY IN THEIR GETTING HOME, WHENEVER THEY
LIKED IT, EITHER NOW OR AN HOUR HENCE.  HE HAD GONE BEYOND THE SWEEP--
SOME WAY ALONG THE HIGHBURY ROAD--THE SNOW WAS NOWHERE ABOVE HALF
AN INCH DEEP--IN MANY PLACES HARDLY ENOUGH TO WHITEN THE GROUND;
A VERY FEW FLAKES WERE FALLING AT PRESENT, BUT THE CLOUDS WERE PARTING,
AND THERE WAS EVERY APPEARANCE OF ITS BEING SOON OVER.  HE HAD SEEN
THE COACHMEN, AND THEY BOTH AGREED WITH HIM IN THERE BEING NOTHING
TO APPREHEND.

TO ISABELLA, THE RELIEF OF SUCH TIDINGS WAS VERY GREAT, AND THEY
WERE SCARCELY LESS ACCEPTABLE TO EMMA ON HER FATHER'S ACCOUNT,
WHO WAS IMMEDIATELY SET AS MUCH AT EASE ON THE SUBJECT AS HIS NERVOUS
CONSTITUTION ALLOWED; BUT THE ALARM THAT HAD BEEN RAISED COULD NOT
BE APPEASED SO AS TO ADMIT OF ANY COMFORT FOR HIM WHILE HE CONTINUED
AT RANDALLS.  HE WAS SATISFIED OF THERE BEING NO PRESENT DANGER IN
RETURNING HOME, BUT NO ASSURANCES COULD CONVINCE HIM THAT IT WAS SAFE
TO STAY; AND WHILE THE OTHERS WERE VARIOUSLY URGING AND RECOMMENDING,
MR. KNIGHTLEY AND EMMA SETTLED IT IN A FEW BRIEF SENTENCES:  THUS--

"YOUR FATHER WILL NOT BE EASY; WHY DO NOT YOU GO?"

"I AM READY, IF THE OTHERS ARE."

"SHALL I RING THE BELL?"

"YES, DO."

AND THE BELL WAS RUNG, AND THE CARRIAGES SPOKEN FOR.  A FEW
MINUTES MORE, AND EMMA HOPED TO SEE ONE TROUBLESOME COMPANION
DEPOSITED IN HIS OWN HOUSE, TO GET SOBER AND COOL, AND THE OTHER
RECOVER HIS TEMPER AND HAPPINESS WHEN THIS VISIT OF HARDSHIP WERE OVER.

THE CARRIAGE CAME:  AND MR. WOODHOUSE, ALWAYS THE FIRST OBJECT ON
SUCH OCCASIONS, WAS CAREFULLY ATTENDED TO HIS OWN BY MR. KNIGHTLEY
AND MR. WESTON; BUT NOT ALL THAT EITHER COULD SAY COULD PREVENT SOME
RENEWAL OF ALARM AT THE SIGHT OF THE SNOW WHICH HAD ACTUALLY FALLEN,
AND THE DISCOVERY OF A MUCH DARKER NIGHT THAN HE HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR.
"HE WAS AFRAID THEY SHOULD HAVE A VERY BAD DRIVE.  HE WAS AFRAID
POOR ISABELLA WOULD NOT LIKE IT.  AND THERE WOULD BE POOR EMMA
IN THE CARRIAGE BEHIND.  HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY HAD BEST DO.
THEY MUST KEEP AS MUCH TOGETHER AS THEY COULD;" AND JAMES WAS TALKED TO,
AND GIVEN A CHARGE TO GO VERY SLOW AND WAIT FOR THE OTHER CARRIAGE.

ISABELLA STEPT IN AFTER HER FATHER; JOHN KNIGHTLEY, FORGETTING THAT HE
DID NOT BELONG TO THEIR PARTY, STEPT IN AFTER HIS WIFE VERY NATURALLY;
SO THAT EMMA FOUND, ON BEING ESCORTED AND FOLLOWED INTO THE SECOND
CARRIAGE BY MR. ELTON, THAT THE DOOR WAS TO BE LAWFULLY SHUT ON THEM,
AND THAT THEY WERE TO HAVE A TETE-A-TETE DRIVE.  IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
THE AWKWARDNESS OF A MOMENT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER A PLEASURE,
PREVIOUS TO THE SUSPICIONS OF THIS VERY DAY; SHE COULD HAVE TALKED
TO HIM OF HARRIET, AND THE THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE WOULD HAVE
SEEMED BUT ONE.  BUT NOW, SHE WOULD RATHER IT HAD NOT HAPPENED.
SHE BELIEVED HE HAD BEEN DRINKING TOO MUCH OF MR. WESTON'S GOOD WINE,
AND FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD WANT TO BE TALKING NONSENSE.

TO RESTRAIN HIM AS MUCH AS MIGHT BE, BY HER OWN MANNERS, SHE WAS
IMMEDIATELY PREPARING TO SPEAK WITH EXQUISITE CALMNESS AND GRAVITY
OF THE WEATHER AND THE NIGHT; BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE BEGUN, SCARCELY HAD
THEY PASSED THE SWEEP-GATE AND JOINED THE OTHER CARRIAGE, THAN SHE
FOUND HER SUBJECT CUT UP--HER HAND SEIZED--HER ATTENTION DEMANDED,
AND MR. ELTON ACTUALLY MAKING VIOLENT LOVE TO HER:  AVAILING HIMSELF
OF THE PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY, DECLARING SENTIMENTS WHICH MUST BE ALREADY
WELL KNOWN, HOPING--FEARING--ADORING--READY TO DIE IF SHE REFUSED HIM;
BUT FLATTERING HIMSELF THAT HIS ARDENT ATTACHMENT AND UNEQUALLED
LOVE AND UNEXAMPLED PASSION COULD NOT FAIL OF HAVING SOME EFFECT,
AND IN SHORT, VERY MUCH RESOLVED ON BEING SERIOUSLY ACCEPTED AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE.  IT REALLY WAS SO.  WITHOUT SCRUPLE--WITHOUT APOLOGY--
WITHOUT MUCH APPARENT DIFFIDENCE, MR. ELTON, THE LOVER OF HARRIET,
WAS PROFESSING HIMSELF _HER_ LOVER.  SHE TRIED TO STOP HIM; BUT VAINLY;
HE WOULD GO ON, AND SAY IT ALL.  ANGRY AS SHE WAS, THE THOUGHT OF
THE MOMENT MADE HER RESOLVE TO RESTRAIN HERSELF WHEN SHE DID SPEAK.
SHE FELT THAT HALF THIS FOLLY MUST BE DRUNKENNESS, AND THEREFORE
COULD HOPE THAT IT MIGHT BELONG ONLY TO THE PASSING HOUR.
ACCORDINGLY, WITH A MIXTURE OF THE SERIOUS AND THE PLAYFUL, WHICH SHE
HOPED WOULD BEST SUIT HIS HALF AND HALF STATE, SHE REPLIED,

"I AM VERY MUCH ASTONISHED, MR. ELTON.  THIS TO _ME_! YOU FORGET YOURSELF--
YOU TAKE ME FOR MY FRIEND--ANY MESSAGE TO MISS SMITH I SHALL
BE HAPPY TO DELIVER; BUT NO MORE OF THIS TO _ME_, IF YOU PLEASE."

"MISS SMITH!--MESSAGE TO MISS SMITH!--WHAT COULD SHE POSSIBLY MEAN!"--
AND HE REPEATED HER WORDS WITH SUCH ASSURANCE OF ACCENT, SUCH BOASTFUL
PRETENCE OF AMAZEMENT, THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP REPLYING WITH QUICKNESS,

"MR. ELTON, THIS IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT! AND I CAN ACCOUNT
FOR IT ONLY IN ONE WAY; YOU ARE NOT YOURSELF, OR YOU COULD NOT SPEAK
EITHER TO ME, OR OF HARRIET, IN SUCH A MANNER.  COMMAND YOURSELF
ENOUGH TO SAY NO MORE, AND I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO FORGET IT."

BUT MR. ELTON HAD ONLY DRUNK WINE ENOUGH TO ELEVATE HIS SPIRITS,
NOT AT ALL TO CONFUSE HIS INTELLECTS.  HE PERFECTLY KNEW HIS OWN MEANING;
AND HAVING WARMLY PROTESTED AGAINST HER SUSPICION AS MOST INJURIOUS,
AND SLIGHTLY TOUCHED UPON HIS RESPECT FOR MISS SMITH AS HER FRIEND,--
BUT ACKNOWLEDGING HIS WONDER THAT MISS SMITH SHOULD BE MENTIONED
AT ALL,--HE RESUMED THE SUBJECT OF HIS OWN PASSION, AND WAS VERY
URGENT FOR A FAVOURABLE ANSWER.

AS SHE THOUGHT LESS OF HIS INEBRIETY, SHE THOUGHT MORE OF HIS INCONSTANCY
AND PRESUMPTION; AND WITH FEWER STRUGGLES FOR POLITENESS, REPLIED,

"IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DOUBT ANY LONGER.  YOU HAVE MADE
YOURSELF TOO CLEAR.  MR. ELTON, MY ASTONISHMENT IS MUCH BEYOND
ANY THING I CAN EXPRESS.  AFTER SUCH BEHAVIOUR, AS I HAVE WITNESSED
DURING THE LAST MONTH, TO MISS SMITH--SUCH ATTENTIONS AS I
HAVE BEEN IN THE DAILY HABIT OF OBSERVING--TO BE ADDRESSING ME
IN THIS MANNER--THIS IS AN UNSTEADINESS OF CHARACTER, INDEED,
WHICH I HAD NOT SUPPOSED POSSIBLE!  BELIEVE ME, SIR, I AM FAR,
VERY FAR, FROM GRATIFIED IN BEING THE OBJECT OF SUCH PROFESSIONS."

"GOOD HEAVEN!" CRIED MR. ELTON, "WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF THIS?--
MISS SMITH!--I NEVER THOUGHT OF MISS SMITH IN THE WHOLE COURSE
OF MY EXISTENCE--NEVER PAID HER ANY ATTENTIONS, BUT AS YOUR FRIEND:
NEVER CARED WHETHER SHE WERE DEAD OR ALIVE, BUT AS YOUR FRIEND.
IF SHE HAS FANCIED OTHERWISE, HER OWN WISHES HAVE MISLED HER,
AND I AM VERY SORRY--EXTREMELY SORRY--BUT, MISS SMITH, INDEED!--OH!
MISS WOODHOUSE! WHO CAN THINK OF MISS SMITH, WHEN MISS WOODHOUSE
IS NEAR!  NO, UPON MY HONOUR, THERE IS NO UNSTEADINESS OF CHARACTER.
I HAVE THOUGHT ONLY OF YOU.  I PROTEST AGAINST HAVING PAID THE SMALLEST
ATTENTION TO ANY ONE ELSE.  EVERY THING THAT I HAVE SAID OR DONE,
FOR MANY WEEKS PAST, HAS BEEN WITH THE SOLE VIEW OF MARKING MY
ADORATION OF YOURSELF.  YOU CANNOT REALLY, SERIOUSLY, DOUBT IT.
NO!--(IN AN ACCENT MEANT TO BE INSINUATING)--I AM SURE YOU HAVE SEEN
AND UNDERSTOOD ME."

IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT EMMA FELT, ON HEARING THIS--
WHICH OF ALL HER UNPLEASANT SENSATIONS WAS UPPERMOST.  SHE WAS
TOO COMPLETELY OVERPOWERED TO BE IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO REPLY:
AND TWO MOMENTS OF SILENCE BEING AMPLE ENCOURAGEMENT FOR MR. ELTON'S
SANGUINE STATE OF MIND, HE TRIED TO TAKE HER HAND AGAIN, AS HE
JOYOUSLY EXCLAIMED--

"CHARMING MISS WOODHOUSE! ALLOW ME TO INTERPRET THIS INTERESTING SILENCE.
IT CONFESSES THAT YOU HAVE LONG UNDERSTOOD ME."

"NO, SIR," CRIED EMMA, "IT CONFESSES NO SUCH THING.  SO FAR FROM
HAVING LONG UNDERSTOOD YOU, I HAVE BEEN IN A MOST COMPLETE ERROR
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR VIEWS, TILL THIS MOMENT.  AS TO MYSELF, I AM
VERY SORRY THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVING WAY TO ANY FEELINGS--
NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM MY WISHES--YOUR ATTACHMENT TO MY
FRIEND HARRIET--YOUR PURSUIT OF HER, (PURSUIT, IT APPEARED,) GAVE ME
GREAT PLEASURE, AND I HAVE BEEN VERY EARNESTLY WISHING YOU SUCCESS:
BUT HAD I SUPPOSED THAT SHE WERE NOT YOUR ATTRACTION TO HARTFIELD,
I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THOUGHT YOU JUDGED ILL IN MAKING YOUR VISITS
SO FREQUENT.  AM I TO BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER SOUGHT TO RECOMMEND
YOURSELF PARTICULARLY TO MISS SMITH?--THAT YOU HAVE NEVER THOUGHT
SERIOUSLY OF HER?"

"NEVER, MADAM," CRIED HE, AFFRONTED IN HIS TURN:  "NEVER, I ASSURE YOU.
_I_ THINK SERIOUSLY OF MISS SMITH!--MISS SMITH IS A VERY GOOD SORT
OF GIRL; AND I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE HER RESPECTABLY SETTLED.
I WISH HER EXTREMELY WELL:  AND, NO DOUBT, THERE ARE MEN WHO MIGHT NOT
OBJECT TO--EVERY BODY HAS THEIR LEVEL:  BUT AS FOR MYSELF, I AM NOT,
I THINK, QUITE SO MUCH AT A LOSS.  I NEED NOT SO TOTALLY DESPAIR
OF AN EQUAL ALLIANCE, AS TO BE ADDRESSING MYSELF TO MISS SMITH!--
NO, MADAM, MY VISITS TO HARTFIELD HAVE BEEN FOR YOURSELF ONLY;
AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT I RECEIVED--"

"ENCOURAGEMENT!--I GIVE YOU ENCOURAGEMENT!--SIR, YOU HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY
MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING IT.  I HAVE SEEN YOU ONLY AS THE ADMIRER
OF MY FRIEND.  IN NO OTHER LIGHT COULD YOU HAVE BEEN MORE TO ME THAN
A COMMON ACQUAINTANCE.  I AM EXCEEDINGLY SORRY:  BUT IT IS WELL THAT
THE MISTAKE ENDS WHERE IT DOES.  HAD THE SAME BEHAVIOUR CONTINUED,
MISS SMITH MIGHT HAVE BEEN LED INTO A MISCONCEPTION OF YOUR VIEWS;
NOT BEING AWARE, PROBABLY, ANY MORE THAN MYSELF, OF THE VERY
GREAT INEQUALITY WHICH YOU ARE SO SENSIBLE OF.  BUT, AS IT IS,
THE DISAPPOINTMENT IS SINGLE, AND, I TRUST, WILL NOT BE LASTING.
I HAVE NO THOUGHTS OF MATRIMONY AT PRESENT."

HE WAS TOO ANGRY TO SAY ANOTHER WORD; HER MANNER TOO DECIDED
TO INVITE SUPPLICATION; AND IN THIS STATE OF SWELLING RESENTMENT,
AND MUTUALLY DEEP MORTIFICATION, THEY HAD TO CONTINUE TOGETHER A FEW
MINUTES LONGER, FOR THE FEARS OF MR. WOODHOUSE HAD CONFINED THEM
TO A FOOT-PACE. IF THERE HAD NOT BEEN SO MUCH ANGER, THERE WOULD HAVE
BEEN DESPERATE AWKWARDNESS; BUT THEIR STRAIGHTFORWARD EMOTIONS LEFT
NO ROOM FOR THE LITTLE ZIGZAGS OF EMBARRASSMENT.  WITHOUT KNOWING
WHEN THE CARRIAGE TURNED INTO VICARAGE LANE, OR WHEN IT STOPPED,
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES, ALL AT ONCE, AT THE DOOR OF HIS HOUSE;
AND HE WAS OUT BEFORE ANOTHER SYLLABLE PASSED.--EMMA THEN FELT IT
INDISPENSABLE TO WISH HIM A GOOD NIGHT.  THE COMPLIMENT WAS JUST RETURNED,
COLDLY AND PROUDLY; AND, UNDER INDESCRIBABLE IRRITATION OF SPIRITS,
SHE WAS THEN CONVEYED TO HARTFIELD.

THERE SHE WAS WELCOMED, WITH THE UTMOST DELIGHT, BY HER FATHER,
WHO HAD BEEN TREMBLING FOR THE DANGERS OF A SOLITARY DRIVE FROM
VICARAGE LANE--TURNING A CORNER WHICH HE COULD NEVER BEAR TO THINK OF--
AND IN STRANGE HANDS--A MERE COMMON COACHMAN--NO JAMES; AND THERE IT
SEEMED AS IF HER RETURN ONLY WERE WANTED TO MAKE EVERY THING GO WELL:
FOR MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY, ASHAMED OF HIS ILL-HUMOUR, WAS NOW ALL
KINDNESS AND ATTENTION; AND SO PARTICULARLY SOLICITOUS FOR THE COMFORT
OF HER FATHER, AS TO SEEM--IF NOT QUITE READY TO JOIN HIM IN A BASIN
OF GRUEL--PERFECTLY SENSIBLE OF ITS BEING EXCEEDINGLY WHOLESOME;
AND THE DAY WAS CONCLUDING IN PEACE AND COMFORT TO ALL THEIR LITTLE PARTY,
EXCEPT HERSELF.--BUT HER MIND HAD NEVER BEEN IN SUCH PERTURBATION;
AND IT NEEDED A VERY STRONG EFFORT TO APPEAR ATTENTIVE AND CHEERFUL TILL
THE USUAL HOUR OF SEPARATING ALLOWED HER THE RELIEF OF QUIET REFLECTION.



CHAPTER XVI


THE HAIR WAS CURLED, AND THE MAID SENT AWAY, AND EMMA SAT DOWN TO THINK
AND BE MISERABLE.--IT WAS A WRETCHED BUSINESS INDEED!--SUCH AN OVERTHROW
OF EVERY THING SHE HAD BEEN WISHING FOR!--SUCH A DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY
THING MOST UNWELCOME!--SUCH A BLOW FOR HARRIET!--THAT WAS THE WORST
OF ALL.  EVERY PART OF IT BROUGHT PAIN AND HUMILIATION, OF SOME SORT
OR OTHER; BUT, COMPARED WITH THE EVIL TO HARRIET, ALL WAS LIGHT;
AND SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE SUBMITTED TO FEEL YET MORE MISTAKEN--
MORE IN ERROR--MORE DISGRACED BY MIS-JUDGMENT, THAN SHE ACTUALLY WAS,
COULD THE EFFECTS OF HER BLUNDERS HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO HERSELF.

"IF I HAD NOT PERSUADED HARRIET INTO LIKING THE MAN, I COULD HAVE
BORNE ANY THING.  HE MIGHT HAVE DOUBLED HIS PRESUMPTION TO ME--
BUT POOR HARRIET!"

HOW SHE COULD HAVE BEEN SO DECEIVED!--HE PROTESTED THAT HE
HAD NEVER THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF HARRIET--NEVER!  SHE LOOKED BACK
AS WELL AS SHE COULD; BUT IT WAS ALL CONFUSION.  SHE HAD TAKEN
UP THE IDEA, SHE SUPPOSED, AND MADE EVERY THING BEND TO IT.
HIS MANNERS, HOWEVER, MUST HAVE BEEN UNMARKED, WAVERING, DUBIOUS,
OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO MISLED.

THE PICTURE!--HOW EAGER HE HAD BEEN ABOUT THE PICTURE!--
AND THE CHARADE!--AND AN HUNDRED OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES;--
HOW CLEARLY THEY HAD SEEMED TO POINT AT HARRIET.  TO BE SURE,
THE CHARADE, WITH ITS "READY WIT"--BUT THEN THE "SOFT EYES"--
IN FACT IT SUITED NEITHER; IT WAS A JUMBLE WITHOUT TASTE OR TRUTH.
WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THROUGH SUCH THICK-HEADED NONSENSE?

CERTAINLY SHE HAD OFTEN, ESPECIALLY OF LATE, THOUGHT HIS MANNERS
TO HERSELF UNNECESSARILY GALLANT; BUT IT HAD PASSED AS HIS WAY,
AS A MERE ERROR OF JUDGMENT, OF KNOWLEDGE, OF TASTE, AS ONE PROOF
AMONG OTHERS THAT HE HAD NOT ALWAYS LIVED IN THE BEST SOCIETY,
THAT WITH ALL THE GENTLENESS OF HIS ADDRESS, TRUE ELEGANCE
WAS SOMETIMES WANTING; BUT, TILL THIS VERY DAY, SHE HAD NEVER,
FOR AN INSTANT, SUSPECTED IT TO MEAN ANY THING BUT GRATEFUL RESPECT
TO HER AS HARRIET'S FRIEND.

TO MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WAS SHE INDEBTED FOR HER FIRST IDEA ON
THE SUBJECT, FOR THE FIRST START OF ITS POSSIBILITY.  THERE WAS
NO DENYING THAT THOSE BROTHERS HAD PENETRATION.  SHE REMEMBERED
WHAT MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD ONCE SAID TO HER ABOUT MR. ELTON, THE CAUTION
HE HAD GIVEN, THE CONVICTION HE HAD PROFESSED THAT MR. ELTON WOULD
NEVER MARRY INDISCREETLY; AND BLUSHED TO THINK HOW MUCH TRUER
A KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CHARACTER HAD BEEN THERE SHEWN THAN ANY SHE
HAD REACHED HERSELF.  IT WAS DREADFULLY MORTIFYING; BUT MR. ELTON
WAS PROVING HIMSELF, IN MANY RESPECTS, THE VERY REVERSE OF WHAT SHE
HAD MEANT AND BELIEVED HIM; PROUD, ASSUMING, CONCEITED; VERY FULL
OF HIS OWN CLAIMS, AND LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS.

CONTRARY TO THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS, MR. ELTON'S WANTING
TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO HER HAD SUNK HIM IN HER OPINION.
HIS PROFESSIONS AND HIS PROPOSALS DID HIM NO SERVICE.  SHE THOUGHT
NOTHING OF HIS ATTACHMENT, AND WAS INSULTED BY HIS HOPES.
HE WANTED TO MARRY WELL, AND HAVING THE ARROGANCE TO RAISE HIS
EYES TO HER, PRETENDED TO BE IN LOVE; BUT SHE WAS PERFECTLY EASY
AS TO HIS NOT SUFFERING ANY DISAPPOINTMENT THAT NEED BE CARED FOR.
THERE HAD BEEN NO REAL AFFECTION EITHER IN HIS LANGUAGE OR MANNERS.
SIGHS AND FINE WORDS HAD BEEN GIVEN IN ABUNDANCE; BUT SHE COULD
HARDLY DEVISE ANY SET OF EXPRESSIONS, OR FANCY ANY TONE OF VOICE,
LESS ALLIED WITH REAL LOVE.  SHE NEED NOT TROUBLE HERSELF TO PITY HIM.
HE ONLY WANTED TO AGGRANDISE AND ENRICH HIMSELF; AND IF MISS WOODHOUSE
OF HARTFIELD, THE HEIRESS OF THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS, WERE NOT QUITE
SO EASILY OBTAINED AS HE HAD FANCIED, HE WOULD SOON TRY FOR MISS
SOMEBODY ELSE WITH TWENTY, OR WITH TEN.

BUT--THAT HE SHOULD TALK OF ENCOURAGEMENT, SHOULD CONSIDER HER AS
AWARE OF HIS VIEWS, ACCEPTING HIS ATTENTIONS, MEANING (IN SHORT),
TO MARRY HIM!--SHOULD SUPPOSE HIMSELF HER EQUAL IN CONNEXION
OR MIND!--LOOK DOWN UPON HER FRIEND, SO WELL UNDERSTANDING THE
GRADATIONS OF RANK BELOW HIM, AND BE SO BLIND TO WHAT ROSE ABOVE,
AS TO FANCY HIMSELF SHEWING NO PRESUMPTION IN ADDRESSING HER!--
IT WAS MOST PROVOKING.

PERHAPS IT WAS NOT FAIR TO EXPECT HIM TO FEEL HOW VERY MUCH HE
WAS HER INFERIOR IN TALENT, AND ALL THE ELEGANCIES OF MIND.
THE VERY WANT OF SUCH EQUALITY MIGHT PREVENT HIS PERCEPTION OF IT;
BUT HE MUST KNOW THAT IN FORTUNE AND CONSEQUENCE SHE WAS GREATLY
HIS SUPERIOR.  HE MUST KNOW THAT THE WOODHOUSES HAD BEEN SETTLED
FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS AT HARTFIELD, THE YOUNGER BRANCH
OF A VERY ANCIENT FAMILY--AND THAT THE ELTONS WERE NOBODY.
THE LANDED PROPERTY OF HARTFIELD CERTAINLY WAS INCONSIDERABLE,
BEING BUT A SORT OF NOTCH IN THE DONWELL ABBEY ESTATE, TO WHICH ALL
THE REST OF HIGHBURY BELONGED; BUT THEIR FORTUNE, FROM OTHER SOURCES,
WAS SUCH AS TO MAKE THEM SCARCELY SECONDARY TO DONWELL ABBEY ITSELF,
IN EVERY OTHER KIND OF CONSEQUENCE; AND THE WOODHOUSES HAD LONG
HELD A HIGH PLACE IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHICH
MR. ELTON HAD FIRST ENTERED NOT TWO YEARS AGO, TO MAKE HIS WAY
AS HE COULD, WITHOUT ANY ALLIANCES BUT IN TRADE, OR ANY THING
TO RECOMMEND HIM TO NOTICE BUT HIS SITUATION AND HIS CIVILITY.--
BUT HE HAD FANCIED HER IN LOVE WITH HIM; THAT EVIDENTLY MUST
HAVE BEEN HIS DEPENDENCE; AND AFTER RAVING A LITTLE ABOUT THE
SEEMING INCONGRUITY OF GENTLE MANNERS AND A CONCEITED HEAD,
EMMA WAS OBLIGED IN COMMON HONESTY TO STOP AND ADMIT THAT HER OWN
BEHAVIOUR TO HIM HAD BEEN SO COMPLAISANT AND OBLIGING, SO FULL OF
COURTESY AND ATTENTION, AS (SUPPOSING HER REAL MOTIVE UNPERCEIVED)
MIGHT WARRANT A MAN OF ORDINARY OBSERVATION AND DELICACY,
LIKE MR. ELTON, IN FANCYING HIMSELF A VERY DECIDED FAVOURITE.  IF _SHE_
HAD SO MISINTERPRETED HIS FEELINGS, SHE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO WONDER
THAT _HE_, WITH SELF-INTEREST TO BLIND HIM, SHOULD HAVE MISTAKEN HERS.

THE FIRST ERROR AND THE WORST LAY AT HER DOOR.  IT WAS FOOLISH,
IT WAS WRONG, TO TAKE SO ACTIVE A PART IN BRINGING ANY TWO
PEOPLE TOGETHER.  IT WAS ADVENTURING TOO FAR, ASSUMING TOO MUCH,
MAKING LIGHT OF WHAT OUGHT TO BE SERIOUS, A TRICK OF WHAT OUGHT
TO BE SIMPLE.  SHE WAS QUITE CONCERNED AND ASHAMED, AND RESOLVED
TO DO SUCH THINGS NO MORE.

"HERE HAVE I," SAID SHE, "ACTUALLY TALKED POOR HARRIET INTO BEING
VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO THIS MAN.  SHE MIGHT NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM
BUT FOR ME; AND CERTAINLY NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM WITH HOPE,
IF I HAD NOT ASSURED HER OF HIS ATTACHMENT, FOR SHE IS AS MODEST
AND HUMBLE AS I USED TO THINK HIM.  OH! THAT I HAD BEEN SATISFIED WITH
PERSUADING HER NOT TO ACCEPT YOUNG MARTIN.  THERE I WAS QUITE RIGHT.
THAT WAS WELL DONE OF ME; BUT THERE I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED, AND LEFT
THE REST TO TIME AND CHANCE.  I WAS INTRODUCING HER INTO GOOD COMPANY,
AND GIVING HER THE OPPORTUNITY OF PLEASING SOME ONE WORTH HAVING;
I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ATTEMPTED MORE.  BUT NOW, POOR GIRL, HER PEACE
IS CUT UP FOR SOME TIME.  I HAVE BEEN BUT HALF A FRIEND TO HER;
AND IF SHE WERE _NOT_ TO FEEL THIS DISAPPOINTMENT SO VERY MUCH, I AM
SURE I HAVE NOT AN IDEA OF ANY BODY ELSE WHO WOULD BE AT ALL DESIRABLE
FOR HER;--WILLIAM COXE--OH! NO, I COULD NOT ENDURE WILLIAM COXE--
A PERT YOUNG LAWYER."

SHE STOPT TO BLUSH AND LAUGH AT HER OWN RELAPSE, AND THEN RESUMED
A MORE SERIOUS, MORE DISPIRITING COGITATION UPON WHAT HAD BEEN,
AND MIGHT BE, AND MUST BE.  THE DISTRESSING EXPLANATION SHE HAD
TO MAKE TO HARRIET, AND ALL THAT POOR HARRIET WOULD BE SUFFERING,
WITH THE AWKWARDNESS OF FUTURE MEETINGS, THE DIFFICULTIES OF
CONTINUING OR DISCONTINUING THE ACQUAINTANCE, OF SUBDUING FEELINGS,
CONCEALING RESENTMENT, AND AVOIDING ECLAT, WERE ENOUGH TO OCCUPY
HER IN MOST UNMIRTHFUL REFLECTIONS SOME TIME LONGER, AND SHE WENT
TO BED AT LAST WITH NOTHING SETTLED BUT THE CONVICTION OF HER HAVING
BLUNDERED MOST DREADFULLY.

TO YOUTH AND NATURAL CHEERFULNESS LIKE EMMA'S, THOUGH UNDER
TEMPORARY GLOOM AT NIGHT, THE RETURN OF DAY WILL HARDLY FAIL
TO BRING RETURN OF SPIRITS.  THE YOUTH AND CHEERFULNESS OF MORNING
ARE IN HAPPY ANALOGY, AND OF POWERFUL OPERATION; AND IF THE
DISTRESS BE NOT POIGNANT ENOUGH TO KEEP THE EYES UNCLOSED, THEY
WILL BE SURE TO OPEN TO SENSATIONS OF SOFTENED PAIN AND BRIGHTER HOPE.

EMMA GOT UP ON THE MORROW MORE DISPOSED FOR COMFORT THAN SHE HAD
GONE TO BED, MORE READY TO SEE ALLEVIATIONS OF THE EVIL BEFORE HER,
AND TO DEPEND ON GETTING TOLERABLY OUT OF IT.

IT WAS A GREAT CONSOLATION THAT MR. ELTON SHOULD NOT BE REALLY
IN LOVE WITH HER, OR SO PARTICULARLY AMIABLE AS TO MAKE IT SHOCKING
TO DISAPPOINT HIM--THAT HARRIET'S NATURE SHOULD NOT BE OF THAT
SUPERIOR SORT IN WHICH THE FEELINGS ARE MOST ACUTE AND RETENTIVE--
AND THAT THERE COULD BE NO NECESSITY FOR ANY BODY'S KNOWING
WHAT HAD PASSED EXCEPT THE THREE PRINCIPALS, AND ESPECIALLY
FOR HER FATHER'S BEING GIVEN A MOMENT'S UNEASINESS ABOUT IT.

THESE WERE VERY CHEERING THOUGHTS; AND THE SIGHT OF A GREAT DEAL
OF SNOW ON THE GROUND DID HER FURTHER SERVICE, FOR ANY THING WAS
WELCOME THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY THEIR ALL THREE BEING QUITE ASUNDER
AT PRESENT.

THE WEATHER WAS MOST FAVOURABLE FOR HER; THOUGH CHRISTMAS DAY,
SHE COULD NOT GO TO CHURCH.  MR. WOODHOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN MISERABLE
HAD HIS DAUGHTER ATTEMPTED IT, AND SHE WAS THEREFORE SAFE FROM
EITHER EXCITING OR RECEIVING UNPLEASANT AND MOST UNSUITABLE IDEAS.
THE GROUND COVERED WITH SNOW, AND THE ATMOSPHERE IN THAT UNSETTLED
STATE BETWEEN FROST AND THAW, WHICH IS OF ALL OTHERS THE MOST
UNFRIENDLY FOR EXERCISE, EVERY MORNING BEGINNING IN RAIN OR SNOW,
AND EVERY EVENING SETTING IN TO FREEZE, SHE WAS FOR MANY DAYS A MOST
HONOURABLE PRISONER.  NO INTERCOURSE WITH HARRIET POSSIBLE BUT BY NOTE;
NO CHURCH FOR HER ON SUNDAY ANY MORE THAN ON CHRISTMAS DAY; AND NO
NEED TO FIND EXCUSES FOR MR. ELTON'S ABSENTING HIMSELF.

IT WAS WEATHER WHICH MIGHT FAIRLY CONFINE EVERY BODY AT HOME;
AND THOUGH SHE HOPED AND BELIEVED HIM TO BE REALLY TAKING COMFORT
IN SOME SOCIETY OR OTHER, IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO HAVE HER FATHER
SO WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS BEING ALL ALONE IN HIS OWN HOUSE,
TOO WISE TO STIR OUT; AND TO HEAR HIM SAY TO MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHOM NO
WEATHER COULD KEEP ENTIRELY FROM THEM,--

"AH!  MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHY DO NOT YOU STAY AT HOME LIKE POOR MR. ELTON?"

THESE DAYS OF CONFINEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN, BUT FOR HER PRIVATE
PERPLEXITIES, REMARKABLY COMFORTABLE, AS SUCH SECLUSION EXACTLY
SUITED HER BROTHER, WHOSE FEELINGS MUST ALWAYS BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
TO HIS COMPANIONS; AND HE HAD, BESIDES, SO THOROUGHLY CLEARED OFF
HIS ILL-HUMOUR AT RANDALLS, THAT HIS AMIABLENESS NEVER FAILED HIM
DURING THE REST OF HIS STAY AT HARTFIELD.  HE WAS ALWAYS AGREEABLE
AND OBLIGING, AND SPEAKING PLEASANTLY OF EVERY BODY.  BUT WITH ALL
THE HOPES OF CHEERFULNESS, AND ALL THE PRESENT COMFORT OF DELAY,
THERE WAS STILL SUCH AN EVIL HANGING OVER HER IN THE HOUR OF EXPLANATION
WITH HARRIET, AS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR EMMA TO BE EVER PERFECTLY AT EASE.



CHAPTER XVII


MR. AND MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WERE NOT DETAINED LONG AT HARTFIELD.
THE WEATHER SOON IMPROVED ENOUGH FOR THOSE TO MOVE WHO MUST MOVE;
AND MR. WOODHOUSE HAVING, AS USUAL, TRIED TO PERSUADE HIS DAUGHTER
TO STAY BEHIND WITH ALL HER CHILDREN, WAS OBLIGED TO SEE THE WHOLE
PARTY SET OFF, AND RETURN TO HIS LAMENTATIONS OVER THE DESTINY
OF POOR ISABELLA;--WHICH POOR ISABELLA, PASSING HER LIFE WITH
THOSE SHE DOATED ON, FULL OF THEIR MERITS, BLIND TO THEIR FAULTS,
AND ALWAYS INNOCENTLY BUSY, MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MODEL OF RIGHT
FEMININE HAPPINESS.

THE EVENING OF THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THEY WENT BROUGHT A NOTE
FROM MR. ELTON TO MR. WOODHOUSE, A LONG, CIVIL, CEREMONIOUS NOTE,
TO SAY, WITH MR. ELTON'S BEST COMPLIMENTS, "THAT HE WAS PROPOSING
TO LEAVE HIGHBURY THE FOLLOWING MORNING IN HIS WAY TO BATH;
WHERE, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRESSING ENTREATIES OF SOME FRIENDS,
HE HAD ENGAGED TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS, AND VERY MUCH REGRETTED
THE IMPOSSIBILITY HE WAS UNDER, FROM VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF
WEATHER AND BUSINESS, OF TAKING A PERSONAL LEAVE OF MR. WOODHOUSE,
OF WHOSE FRIENDLY CIVILITIES HE SHOULD EVER RETAIN A GRATEFUL SENSE--
AND HAD MR. WOODHOUSE ANY COMMANDS, SHOULD BE HAPPY TO ATTEND TO THEM."

EMMA WAS MOST AGREEABLY SURPRIZED.--MR. ELTON'S ABSENCE JUST
AT THIS TIME WAS THE VERY THING TO BE DESIRED.  SHE ADMIRED
HIM FOR CONTRIVING IT, THOUGH NOT ABLE TO GIVE HIM MUCH CREDIT
FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ANNOUNCED.  RESENTMENT COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN MORE PLAINLY SPOKEN THAN IN A CIVILITY TO HER FATHER,
FROM WHICH SHE WAS SO POINTEDLY EXCLUDED.  SHE HAD NOT EVEN A
SHARE IN HIS OPENING COMPLIMENTS.--HER NAME WAS NOT MENTIONED;--
AND THERE WAS SO STRIKING A CHANGE IN ALL THIS, AND SUCH AN
ILL-JUDGED SOLEMNITY OF LEAVE-TAKING IN HIS GRACEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS,
AS SHE THOUGHT, AT FIRST, COULD NOT ESCAPE HER FATHER'S SUSPICION.

IT DID, HOWEVER.--HER FATHER WAS QUITE TAKEN UP WITH THE SURPRIZE
OF SO SUDDEN A JOURNEY, AND HIS FEARS THAT MR. ELTON MIGHT NEVER GET
SAFELY TO THE END OF IT, AND SAW NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN HIS LANGUAGE.
IT WAS A VERY USEFUL NOTE, FOR IT SUPPLIED THEM WITH FRESH MATTER
FOR THOUGHT AND CONVERSATION DURING THE REST OF THEIR LONELY EVENING.
MR. WOODHOUSE TALKED OVER HIS ALARMS, AND EMMA WAS IN SPIRITS
TO PERSUADE THEM AWAY WITH ALL HER USUAL PROMPTITUDE.

SHE NOW RESOLVED TO KEEP HARRIET NO LONGER IN THE DARK.  SHE HAD
REASON TO BELIEVE HER NEARLY RECOVERED FROM HER COLD, AND IT WAS
DESIRABLE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE FOR GETTING
THE BETTER OF HER OTHER COMPLAINT BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN'S RETURN.
SHE WENT TO MRS. GODDARD'S ACCORDINGLY THE VERY NEXT DAY, TO UNDERGO
THE NECESSARY PENANCE OF COMMUNICATION; AND A SEVERE ONE IT WAS.--
SHE HAD TO DESTROY ALL THE HOPES WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SO INDUSTRIOUSLY
FEEDING--TO APPEAR IN THE UNGRACIOUS CHARACTER OF THE ONE PREFERRED--
AND ACKNOWLEDGE HERSELF GROSSLY MISTAKEN AND MIS-JUDGING IN ALL HER
IDEAS ON ONE SUBJECT, ALL HER OBSERVATIONS, ALL HER CONVICTIONS,
ALL HER PROPHECIES FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS.

THE CONFESSION COMPLETELY RENEWED HER FIRST SHAME--AND THE SIGHT
OF HARRIET'S TEARS MADE HER THINK THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER BE IN CHARITY
WITH HERSELF AGAIN.

HARRIET BORE THE INTELLIGENCE VERY WELL--BLAMING NOBODY--
AND IN EVERY THING TESTIFYING SUCH AN INGENUOUSNESS OF DISPOSITION
AND LOWLY OPINION OF HERSELF, AS MUST APPEAR WITH PARTICULAR
ADVANTAGE AT THAT MOMENT TO HER FRIEND.

EMMA WAS IN THE HUMOUR TO VALUE SIMPLICITY AND MODESTY TO THE UTMOST;
AND ALL THAT WAS AMIABLE, ALL THAT OUGHT TO BE ATTACHING,
SEEMED ON HARRIET'S SIDE, NOT HER OWN.  HARRIET DID NOT CONSIDER
HERSELF AS HAVING ANY THING TO COMPLAIN OF.  THE AFFECTION OF SUCH
A MAN AS MR. ELTON WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT A DISTINCTION.--
SHE NEVER COULD HAVE DESERVED HIM--AND NOBODY BUT SO PARTIAL
AND KIND A FRIEND AS MISS WOODHOUSE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE.

HER TEARS FELL ABUNDANTLY--BUT HER GRIEF WAS SO TRULY ARTLESS,
THAT NO DIGNITY COULD HAVE MADE IT MORE RESPECTABLE IN EMMA'S EYES--
AND SHE LISTENED TO HER AND TRIED TO CONSOLE HER WITH ALL HER HEART
AND UNDERSTANDING--REALLY FOR THE TIME CONVINCED THAT HARRIET WAS
THE SUPERIOR CREATURE OF THE TWO--AND THAT TO RESEMBLE HER WOULD
BE MORE FOR HER OWN WELFARE AND HAPPINESS THAN ALL THAT GENIUS OR
INTELLIGENCE COULD DO.

IT WAS RATHER TOO LATE IN THE DAY TO SET ABOUT BEING SIMPLE-MINDED
AND IGNORANT; BUT SHE LEFT HER WITH EVERY PREVIOUS RESOLUTION
CONFIRMED OF BEING HUMBLE AND DISCREET, AND REPRESSING IMAGINATION
ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE.  HER SECOND DUTY NOW, INFERIOR ONLY TO HER
FATHER'S CLAIMS, WAS TO PROMOTE HARRIET'S COMFORT, AND ENDEAVOUR
TO PROVE HER OWN AFFECTION IN SOME BETTER METHOD THAN BY MATCH-MAKING.
SHE GOT HER TO HARTFIELD, AND SHEWED HER THE MOST UNVARYING KINDNESS,
STRIVING TO OCCUPY AND AMUSE HER, AND BY BOOKS AND CONVERSATION,
TO DRIVE MR. ELTON FROM HER THOUGHTS.

TIME, SHE KNEW, MUST BE ALLOWED FOR THIS BEING THOROUGHLY DONE; AND SHE
COULD SUPPOSE HERSELF BUT AN INDIFFERENT JUDGE OF SUCH MATTERS IN GENERAL,
AND VERY INADEQUATE TO SYMPATHISE IN AN ATTACHMENT TO MR. ELTON
IN PARTICULAR; BUT IT SEEMED TO HER REASONABLE THAT AT HARRIET'S AGE,
AND WITH THE ENTIRE EXTINCTION OF ALL HOPE, SUCH A PROGRESS MIGHT BE
MADE TOWARDS A STATE OF COMPOSURE BY THE TIME OF MR. ELTON'S RETURN,
AS TO ALLOW THEM ALL TO MEET AGAIN IN THE COMMON ROUTINE OF ACQUAINTANCE,
WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF BETRAYING SENTIMENTS OR INCREASING THEM.

HARRIET DID THINK HIM ALL PERFECTION, AND MAINTAINED THE NON-EXISTENCE
OF ANY BODY EQUAL TO HIM IN PERSON OR GOODNESS--AND DID, IN TRUTH,
PROVE HERSELF MORE RESOLUTELY IN LOVE THAN EMMA HAD FORESEEN;
BUT YET IT APPEARED TO HER SO NATURAL, SO INEVITABLE TO STRIVE
AGAINST AN INCLINATION OF THAT SORT _UNREQUITED_, THAT SHE COULD NOT
COMPREHEND ITS CONTINUING VERY LONG IN EQUAL FORCE.

IF MR. ELTON, ON HIS RETURN, MADE HIS OWN INDIFFERENCE AS EVIDENT
AND INDUBITABLE AS SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HE WOULD ANXIOUSLY DO,
SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE HARRIET'S PERSISTING TO PLACE HER HAPPINESS
IN THE SIGHT OR THE RECOLLECTION OF HIM.

THEIR BEING FIXED, SO ABSOLUTELY FIXED, IN THE SAME PLACE, WAS BAD
FOR EACH, FOR ALL THREE.  NOT ONE OF THEM HAD THE POWER OF REMOVAL,
OR OF EFFECTING ANY MATERIAL CHANGE OF SOCIETY.  THEY MUST ENCOUNTER
EACH OTHER, AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

HARRIET WAS FARTHER UNFORTUNATE IN THE TONE OF HER COMPANIONS AT
MRS. GODDARD'S; MR. ELTON BEING THE ADORATION OF ALL THE TEACHERS
AND GREAT GIRLS IN THE SCHOOL; AND IT MUST BE AT HARTFIELD ONLY
THAT SHE COULD HAVE ANY CHANCE OF HEARING HIM SPOKEN OF WITH COOLING
MODERATION OR REPELLENT TRUTH.  WHERE THE WOUND HAD BEEN GIVEN,
THERE MUST THE CURE BE FOUND IF ANYWHERE; AND EMMA FELT THAT,
TILL SHE SAW HER IN THE WAY OF CURE, THERE COULD BE NO TRUE PEACE
FOR HERSELF.



CHAPTER XVIII


MR. FRANK CHURCHILL DID NOT COME.  WHEN THE TIME PROPOSED
DREW NEAR, MRS. WESTON'S FEARS WERE JUSTIFIED IN THE ARRIVAL
OF A LETTER OF EXCUSE.  FOR THE PRESENT, HE COULD NOT BE SPARED,
TO HIS "VERY GREAT MORTIFICATION AND REGRET; BUT STILL HE LOOKED
FORWARD WITH THE HOPE OF COMING TO RANDALLS AT NO DISTANT PERIOD."

MRS. WESTON WAS EXCEEDINGLY DISAPPOINTED--MUCH MORE DISAPPOINTED,
IN FACT, THAN HER HUSBAND, THOUGH HER DEPENDENCE ON SEEING THE
YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN SO MUCH MORE SOBER:  BUT A SANGUINE TEMPER,
THOUGH FOR EVER EXPECTING MORE GOOD THAN OCCURS, DOES NOT
ALWAYS PAY FOR ITS HOPES BY ANY PROPORTIONATE DEPRESSION.
IT SOON FLIES OVER THE PRESENT FAILURE, AND BEGINS TO HOPE AGAIN.
FOR HALF AN HOUR MR. WESTON WAS SURPRIZED AND SORRY; BUT THEN HE
BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT FRANK'S COMING TWO OR THREE MONTHS LATER
WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER PLAN; BETTER TIME OF YEAR; BETTER WEATHER;
AND THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, TO STAY CONSIDERABLY
LONGER WITH THEM THAN IF HE HAD COME SOONER.

THESE FEELINGS RAPIDLY RESTORED HIS COMFORT, WHILE MRS. WESTON,
OF A MORE APPREHENSIVE DISPOSITION, FORESAW NOTHING BUT A REPETITION
OF EXCUSES AND DELAYS; AND AFTER ALL HER CONCERN FOR WHAT HER HUSBAND
WAS TO SUFFER, SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL MORE HERSELF.

EMMA WAS NOT AT THIS TIME IN A STATE OF SPIRITS TO CARE REALLY
ABOUT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL'S NOT COMING, EXCEPT AS A DISAPPOINTMENT
AT RANDALLS.  THE ACQUAINTANCE AT PRESENT HAD NO CHARM FOR HER.
SHE WANTED, RATHER, TO BE QUIET, AND OUT OF TEMPTATION; BUT STILL, AS IT
WAS DESIRABLE THAT SHE SHOULD APPEAR, IN GENERAL, LIKE HER USUAL SELF,
SHE TOOK CARE TO EXPRESS AS MUCH INTEREST IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE,
AND ENTER AS WARMLY INTO MR. AND MRS. WESTON'S DISAPPOINTMENT,
AS MIGHT NATURALLY BELONG TO THEIR FRIENDSHIP.

SHE WAS THE FIRST TO ANNOUNCE IT TO MR. KNIGHTLEY; AND EXCLAIMED
QUITE AS MUCH AS WAS NECESSARY, (OR, BEING ACTING A PART, PERHAPS
RATHER MORE,) AT THE CONDUCT OF THE CHURCHILLS, IN KEEPING HIM AWAY.
SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO SAY A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN SHE FELT, OF THE
ADVANTAGE OF SUCH AN ADDITION TO THEIR CONFINED SOCIETY IN SURRY;
THE PLEASURE OF LOOKING AT SOMEBODY NEW; THE GALA-DAY TO HIGHBURY ENTIRE,
WHICH THE SIGHT OF HIM WOULD HAVE MADE; AND ENDING WITH REFLECTIONS
ON THE CHURCHILLS AGAIN, FOUND HERSELF DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN A
DISAGREEMENT WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY; AND, TO HER GREAT AMUSEMENT,
PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS TAKING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION FROM HER
REAL OPINION, AND MAKING USE OF MRS. WESTON'S ARGUMENTS AGAINST HERSELF.

"THE CHURCHILLS ARE VERY LIKELY IN FAULT," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY,
COOLLY; "BUT I DARE SAY HE MIGHT COME IF HE WOULD."

"I DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD SAY SO.  HE WISHES EXCEEDINGLY TO COME;
BUT HIS UNCLE AND AUNT WILL NOT SPARE HIM."

"I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAS NOT THE POWER OF COMING, IF HE MADE
A POINT OF IT.  IT IS TOO UNLIKELY, FOR ME TO BELIEVE IT WITHOUT PROOF."

"HOW ODD YOU ARE!  WHAT HAS MR. FRANK CHURCHILL DONE, TO MAKE YOU
SUPPOSE HIM SUCH AN UNNATURAL CREATURE?"

"I AM NOT SUPPOSING HIM AT ALL AN UNNATURAL CREATURE, IN SUSPECTING
THAT HE MAY HAVE LEARNT TO BE ABOVE HIS CONNEXIONS, AND TO CARE
VERY LITTLE FOR ANY THING BUT HIS OWN PLEASURE, FROM LIVING WITH
THOSE WHO HAVE ALWAYS SET HIM THE EXAMPLE OF IT.  IT IS A GREAT DEAL
MORE NATURAL THAN ONE COULD WISH, THAT A YOUNG MAN, BROUGHT UP
BY THOSE WHO ARE PROUD, LUXURIOUS, AND SELFISH, SHOULD BE PROUD,
LUXURIOUS, AND SELFISH TOO.  IF FRANK CHURCHILL HAD WANTED TO SEE
HIS FATHER, HE WOULD HAVE CONTRIVED IT BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND JANUARY.
A MAN AT HIS AGE--WHAT IS HE?--THREE OR FOUR-AND-TWENTY--CANNOT BE
WITHOUT THE MEANS OF DOING AS MUCH AS THAT.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE."

"THAT'S EASILY SAID, AND EASILY FELT BY YOU, WHO HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN YOUR OWN MASTER.  YOU ARE THE WORST JUDGE IN THE WORLD,
MR. KNIGHTLEY, OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF DEPENDENCE.  YOU DO NOT KNOW
WHAT IT IS TO HAVE TEMPERS TO MANAGE."

"IT IS NOT TO BE CONCEIVED THAT A MAN OF THREE OR FOUR-AND-TWENTY
SHOULD NOT HAVE LIBERTY OF MIND OR LIMB TO THAT AMOUNT.  HE CANNOT
WANT MONEY--HE CANNOT WANT LEISURE.  WE KNOW, ON THE CONTRARY,
THAT HE HAS SO MUCH OF BOTH, THAT HE IS GLAD TO GET RID OF THEM AT
THE IDLEST HAUNTS IN THE KINGDOM.  WE HEAR OF HIM FOR EVER AT SOME
WATERING-PLACE OR OTHER.  A LITTLE WHILE AGO, HE WAS AT WEYMOUTH.
THIS PROVES THAT HE CAN LEAVE THE CHURCHILLS."

"YES, SOMETIMES HE CAN."

"AND THOSE TIMES ARE WHENEVER HE THINKS IT WORTH HIS WHILE;
WHENEVER THERE IS ANY TEMPTATION OF PLEASURE."

"IT IS VERY UNFAIR TO JUDGE OF ANY BODY'S CONDUCT, WITHOUT AN
INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SITUATION.  NOBODY, WHO HAS NOT BEEN
IN THE INTERIOR OF A FAMILY, CAN SAY WHAT THE DIFFICULTIES
OF ANY INDIVIDUAL OF THAT FAMILY MAY BE.  WE OUGHT TO BE
ACQUAINTED WITH ENSCOMBE, AND WITH MRS. CHURCHILL'S TEMPER,
BEFORE WE PRETEND TO DECIDE UPON WHAT HER NEPHEW CAN DO.
HE MAY, AT TIMES, BE ABLE TO DO A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE CAN AT OTHERS."

"THERE IS ONE THING, EMMA, WHICH A MAN CAN ALWAYS DO, IF HE CHUSES,
AND THAT IS, HIS DUTY; NOT BY MANOEUVRING AND FINESSING, BUT BY VIGOUR
AND RESOLUTION.  IT IS FRANK CHURCHILL'S DUTY TO PAY THIS ATTENTION
TO HIS FATHER.  HE KNOWS IT TO BE SO, BY HIS PROMISES AND MESSAGES;
BUT IF HE WISHED TO DO IT, IT MIGHT BE DONE.  A MAN WHO FELT RIGHTLY
WOULD SAY AT ONCE, SIMPLY AND RESOLUTELY, TO MRS. CHURCHILL--
`EVERY SACRIFICE OF MERE PLEASURE YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND ME READY TO MAKE
TO YOUR CONVENIENCE; BUT I MUST GO AND SEE MY FATHER IMMEDIATELY.
I KNOW HE WOULD BE HURT BY MY FAILING IN SUCH A MARK OF RESPECT TO HIM
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION.  I SHALL, THEREFORE, SET OFF TO-MORROW.'--
IF HE WOULD SAY SO TO HER AT ONCE, IN THE TONE OF DECISION BECOMING
A MAN, THERE WOULD BE NO OPPOSITION MADE TO HIS GOING."

"NO," SAID EMMA, LAUGHING; "BUT PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE SOME MADE TO HIS
COMING BACK AGAIN.  SUCH LANGUAGE FOR A YOUNG MAN ENTIRELY DEPENDENT,
TO USE!--NOBODY BUT YOU, MR. KNIGHTLEY, WOULD IMAGINE IT POSSIBLE.
BUT YOU HAVE NOT AN IDEA OF WHAT IS REQUISITE IN SITUATIONS DIRECTLY
OPPOSITE TO YOUR OWN.  MR. FRANK CHURCHILL TO BE MAKING SUCH
A SPEECH AS THAT TO THE UNCLE AND AUNT, WHO HAVE BROUGHT HIM UP,
AND ARE TO PROVIDE FOR HIM!--STANDING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM,
I SUPPOSE, AND SPEAKING AS LOUD AS HE COULD!--HOW CAN YOU IMAGINE
SUCH CONDUCT PRACTICABLE?"

"DEPEND UPON IT, EMMA, A SENSIBLE MAN WOULD FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN IT.
HE WOULD FEEL HIMSELF IN THE RIGHT; AND THE DECLARATION--MADE,
OF COURSE, AS A MAN OF SENSE WOULD MAKE IT, IN A PROPER MANNER--
WOULD DO HIM MORE GOOD, RAISE HIM HIGHER, FIX HIS INTEREST STRONGER
WITH THE PEOPLE HE DEPENDED ON, THAN ALL THAT A LINE OF SHIFTS
AND EXPEDIENTS CAN EVER DO.  RESPECT WOULD BE ADDED TO AFFECTION.
THEY WOULD FEEL THAT THEY COULD TRUST HIM; THAT THE NEPHEW WHO HAD
DONE RIGHTLY BY HIS FATHER, WOULD DO RIGHTLY BY THEM; FOR THEY KNOW,
AS WELL AS HE DOES, AS WELL AS ALL THE WORLD MUST KNOW, THAT HE
OUGHT TO PAY THIS VISIT TO HIS FATHER; AND WHILE MEANLY EXERTING
THEIR POWER TO DELAY IT, ARE IN THEIR HEARTS NOT THINKING THE BETTER
OF HIM FOR SUBMITTING TO THEIR WHIMS.  RESPECT FOR RIGHT CONDUCT
IS FELT BY EVERY BODY.  IF HE WOULD ACT IN THIS SORT OF MANNER,
ON PRINCIPLE, CONSISTENTLY, REGULARLY, THEIR LITTLE MINDS WOULD BEND
TO HIS."

"I RATHER DOUBT THAT.  YOU ARE VERY FOND OF BENDING LITTLE MINDS;
BUT WHERE LITTLE MINDS BELONG TO RICH PEOPLE IN AUTHORITY,
I THINK THEY HAVE A KNACK OF SWELLING OUT, TILL THEY ARE QUITE AS
UNMANAGEABLE AS GREAT ONES.  I CAN IMAGINE, THAT IF YOU, AS YOU ARE,
MR. KNIGHTLEY, WERE TO BE TRANSPORTED AND PLACED ALL AT ONCE IN
MR. FRANK CHURCHILL'S SITUATION, YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY AND DO
JUST WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDING FOR HIM; AND IT MIGHT HAVE
A VERY GOOD EFFECT.  THE CHURCHILLS MIGHT NOT HAVE A WORD TO SAY
IN RETURN; BUT THEN, YOU WOULD HAVE NO HABITS OF EARLY OBEDIENCE
AND LONG OBSERVANCE TO BREAK THROUGH.  TO HIM WHO HAS, IT MIGHT
NOT BE SO EASY TO BURST FORTH AT ONCE INTO PERFECT INDEPENDENCE,
AND SET ALL THEIR CLAIMS ON HIS GRATITUDE AND REGARD AT NOUGHT.
HE MAY HAVE AS STRONG A SENSE OF WHAT WOULD BE RIGHT, AS YOU CAN HAVE,
WITHOUT BEING SO EQUAL, UNDER PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, TO ACT UP
TO IT."

"THEN IT WOULD NOT BE SO STRONG A SENSE.  IF IT FAILED TO PRODUCE
EQUAL EXERTION, IT COULD NOT BE AN EQUAL CONVICTION."

"OH, THE DIFFERENCE OF SITUATION AND HABIT!  I WISH YOU WOULD TRY
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AN AMIABLE YOUNG MAN MAY BE LIKELY TO FEEL
IN DIRECTLY OPPOSING THOSE, WHOM AS CHILD AND BOY HE HAS BEEN
LOOKING UP TO ALL HIS LIFE."

"OUR AMIABLE YOUNG MAN IS A VERY WEAK YOUNG MAN, IF THIS BE THE FIRST
OCCASION OF HIS CARRYING THROUGH A RESOLUTION TO DO RIGHT AGAINST
THE WILL OF OTHERS.  IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A HABIT WITH HIM BY
THIS TIME, OF FOLLOWING HIS DUTY, INSTEAD OF CONSULTING EXPEDIENCY.
I CAN ALLOW FOR THE FEARS OF THE CHILD, BUT NOT OF THE MAN.
AS HE BECAME RATIONAL, HE OUGHT TO HAVE ROUSED HIMSELF AND SHAKEN OFF
ALL THAT WAS UNWORTHY IN THEIR AUTHORITY.  HE OUGHT TO HAVE OPPOSED
THE FIRST ATTEMPT ON THEIR SIDE TO MAKE HIM SLIGHT HIS FATHER.
HAD HE BEGUN AS HE OUGHT, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DIFFICULTY NOW."

"WE SHALL NEVER AGREE ABOUT HIM," CRIED EMMA; "BUT THAT IS
NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY.  I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA OF HIS BEING
A WEAK YOUNG MAN:  I FEEL SURE THAT HE IS NOT.  MR. WESTON WOULD
NOT BE BLIND TO FOLLY, THOUGH IN HIS OWN SON; BUT HE IS VERY LIKELY
TO HAVE A MORE YIELDING, COMPLYING, MILD DISPOSITION THAN WOULD SUIT
YOUR NOTIONS OF MAN'S PERFECTION.  I DARE SAY HE HAS; AND THOUGH
IT MAY CUT HIM OFF FROM SOME ADVANTAGES, IT WILL SECURE HIM MANY OTHERS."

"YES; ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF SITTING STILL WHEN HE OUGHT TO MOVE,
AND OF LEADING A LIFE OF MERE IDLE PLEASURE, AND FANCYING HIMSELF
EXTREMELY EXPERT IN FINDING EXCUSES FOR IT.  HE CAN SIT DOWN AND
WRITE A FINE FLOURISHING LETTER, FULL OF PROFESSIONS AND FALSEHOODS,
AND PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE HAS HIT UPON THE VERY BEST METHOD
IN THE WORLD OF PRESERVING PEACE AT HOME AND PREVENTING HIS FATHER'S
HAVING ANY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN.  HIS LETTERS DISGUST ME."

"YOUR FEELINGS ARE SINGULAR.  THEY SEEM TO SATISFY EVERY BODY ELSE."

"I SUSPECT THEY DO NOT SATISFY MRS. WESTON.  THEY HARDLY CAN
SATISFY A WOMAN OF HER GOOD SENSE AND QUICK FEELINGS:  STANDING IN
A MOTHER'S PLACE, BUT WITHOUT A MOTHER'S AFFECTION TO BLIND HER.
IT IS ON HER ACCOUNT THAT ATTENTION TO RANDALLS IS DOUBLY DUE,
AND SHE MUST DOUBLY FEEL THE OMISSION.  HAD SHE BEEN A PERSON
OF CONSEQUENCE HERSELF, HE WOULD HAVE COME I DARE SAY; AND IT WOULD
NOT HAVE SIGNIFIED WHETHER HE DID OR NO.  CAN YOU THINK YOUR FRIEND
BEHINDHAND IN THESE SORT OF CONSIDERATIONS?  DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE
DOES NOT OFTEN SAY ALL THIS TO HERSELF?  NO, EMMA, YOUR AMIABLE
YOUNG MAN CAN BE AMIABLE ONLY IN FRENCH, NOT IN ENGLISH.  HE MAY BE
VERY `AIMABLE,' HAVE VERY GOOD MANNERS, AND BE VERY AGREEABLE; BUT HE
CAN HAVE NO ENGLISH DELICACY TOWARDS THE FEELINGS OF OTHER PEOPLE:
NOTHING REALLY AMIABLE ABOUT HIM."

"YOU SEEM DETERMINED TO THINK ILL OF HIM."

"ME!--NOT AT ALL," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY, RATHER DISPLEASED; "I DO
NOT WANT TO THINK ILL OF HIM.  I SHOULD BE AS READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE
HIS MERITS AS ANY OTHER MAN; BUT I HEAR OF NONE, EXCEPT WHAT ARE
MERELY PERSONAL; THAT HE IS WELL-GROWN AND GOOD-LOOKING, WITH SMOOTH,
PLAUSIBLE MANNERS."

"WELL, IF HE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO RECOMMEND HIM, HE WILL BE A
TREASURE AT HIGHBURY.  WE DO NOT OFTEN LOOK UPON FINE YOUNG MEN,
WELL-BRED AND AGREEABLE.  WE MUST NOT BE NICE AND ASK FOR ALL
THE VIRTUES INTO THE BARGAIN.  CANNOT YOU IMAGINE, MR. KNIGHTLEY,
WHAT A _SENSATION_ HIS COMING WILL PRODUCE?  THERE WILL BE BUT ONE SUBJECT
THROUGHOUT THE PARISHES OF DONWELL AND HIGHBURY; BUT ONE INTEREST--
ONE OBJECT OF CURIOSITY; IT WILL BE ALL MR. FRANK CHURCHILL;
WE SHALL THINK AND SPEAK OF NOBODY ELSE."

"YOU WILL EXCUSE MY BEING SO MUCH OVER-POWERED. IF I FIND HIM
CONVERSABLE, I SHALL BE GLAD OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE; BUT IF HE IS ONLY
A CHATTERING COXCOMB, HE WILL NOT OCCUPY MUCH OF MY TIME OR THOUGHTS."

"MY IDEA OF HIM IS, THAT HE CAN ADAPT HIS CONVERSATION TO THE TASTE
OF EVERY BODY, AND HAS THE POWER AS WELL AS THE WISH OF BEING
UNIVERSALLY AGREEABLE.  TO YOU, HE WILL TALK OF FARMING; TO ME,
OF DRAWING OR MUSIC; AND SO ON TO EVERY BODY, HAVING THAT GENERAL
INFORMATION ON ALL SUBJECTS WHICH WILL ENABLE HIM TO FOLLOW THE LEAD,
OR TAKE THE LEAD, JUST AS PROPRIETY MAY REQUIRE, AND TO SPEAK
EXTREMELY WELL ON EACH; THAT IS MY IDEA OF HIM."

"AND MINE," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY WARMLY, "IS, THAT IF HE TURN OUT ANY
THING LIKE IT, HE WILL BE THE MOST INSUFFERABLE FELLOW BREATHING!
WHAT! AT THREE-AND-TWENTY TO BE THE KING OF HIS COMPANY--THE GREAT MAN--
THE PRACTISED POLITICIAN, WHO IS TO READ EVERY BODY'S CHARACTER,
AND MAKE EVERY BODY'S TALENTS CONDUCE TO THE DISPLAY OF HIS
OWN SUPERIORITY; TO BE DISPENSING HIS FLATTERIES AROUND, THAT HE
MAY MAKE ALL APPEAR LIKE FOOLS COMPARED WITH HIMSELF!  MY DEAR EMMA,
YOUR OWN GOOD SENSE COULD NOT ENDURE SUCH A PUPPY WHEN IT CAME
TO THE POINT."

"I WILL SAY NO MORE ABOUT HIM," CRIED EMMA, "YOU TURN EVERY
THING TO EVIL.  WE ARE BOTH PREJUDICED; YOU AGAINST, I FOR HIM;
AND WE HAVE NO CHANCE OF AGREEING TILL HE IS REALLY HERE."

"PREJUDICED!  I AM NOT PREJUDICED."

"BUT I AM VERY MUCH, AND WITHOUT BEING AT ALL ASHAMED OF IT.
MY LOVE FOR MR. AND MRS. WESTON GIVES ME A DECIDED PREJUDICE IN
HIS FAVOUR."

"HE IS A PERSON I NEVER THINK OF FROM ONE MONTH'S END TO ANOTHER,"
SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, WITH A DEGREE OF VEXATION, WHICH MADE EMMA
IMMEDIATELY TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE, THOUGH SHE COULD NOT COMPREHEND
WHY HE SHOULD BE ANGRY.

TO TAKE A DISLIKE TO A YOUNG MAN, ONLY BECAUSE HE APPEARED TO BE
OF A DIFFERENT DISPOSITION FROM HIMSELF, WAS UNWORTHY THE REAL
LIBERALITY OF MIND WHICH SHE WAS ALWAYS USED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IN HIM;
FOR WITH ALL THE HIGH OPINION OF HIMSELF, WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN LAID
TO HIS CHARGE, SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSED IT COULD
MAKE HIM UNJUST TO THE MERIT OF ANOTHER.




VOLUME II



CHAPTER I


EMMA AND HARRIET HAD BEEN WALKING TOGETHER ONE MORNING, AND,
IN EMMA'S OPINION, HAD BEEN TALKING ENOUGH OF MR. ELTON FOR THAT DAY.
SHE COULD NOT THINK THAT HARRIET'S SOLACE OR HER OWN SINS REQUIRED MORE;
AND SHE WAS THEREFORE INDUSTRIOUSLY GETTING RID OF THE SUBJECT
AS THEY RETURNED;--BUT IT BURST OUT AGAIN WHEN SHE THOUGHT SHE
HAD SUCCEEDED, AND AFTER SPEAKING SOME TIME OF WHAT THE POOR MUST
SUFFER IN WINTER, AND RECEIVING NO OTHER ANSWER THAN A VERY PLAINTIVE--
"MR. ELTON IS SO GOOD TO THE POOR!" SHE FOUND SOMETHING ELSE MUST BE DONE.

THEY WERE JUST APPROACHING THE HOUSE WHERE LIVED MRS. AND MISS BATES.
SHE DETERMINED TO CALL UPON THEM AND SEEK SAFETY IN NUMBERS.
THERE WAS ALWAYS SUFFICIENT REASON FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION; MRS. AND
MISS BATES LOVED TO BE CALLED ON, AND SHE KNEW SHE WAS CONSIDERED
BY THE VERY FEW WHO PRESUMED EVER TO SEE IMPERFECTION IN HER,
AS RATHER NEGLIGENT IN THAT RESPECT, AND AS NOT CONTRIBUTING WHAT SHE
OUGHT TO THE STOCK OF THEIR SCANTY COMFORTS.

SHE HAD HAD MANY A HINT FROM MR. KNIGHTLEY AND SOME FROM HER OWN HEART,
AS TO HER DEFICIENCY--BUT NONE WERE EQUAL TO COUNTERACT THE PERSUASION
OF ITS BEING VERY DISAGREEABLE,--A WASTE OF TIME--TIRESOME WOMEN--
AND ALL THE HORROR OF BEING IN DANGER OF FALLING IN WITH THE SECOND-RATE
AND THIRD-RATE OF HIGHBURY, WHO WERE CALLING ON THEM FOR EVER,
AND THEREFORE SHE SELDOM WENT NEAR THEM.  BUT NOW SHE MADE THE SUDDEN
RESOLUTION OF NOT PASSING THEIR DOOR WITHOUT GOING IN--OBSERVING,
AS SHE PROPOSED IT TO HARRIET, THAT, AS WELL AS SHE COULD CALCULATE,
THEY WERE JUST NOW QUITE SAFE FROM ANY LETTER FROM JANE FAIRFAX.

THE HOUSE BELONGED TO PEOPLE IN BUSINESS.  MRS. AND MISS BATES OCCUPIED
THE DRAWING-ROOM FLOOR; AND THERE, IN THE VERY MODERATE-SIZED APARTMENT,
WHICH WAS EVERY THING TO THEM, THE VISITORS WERE MOST CORDIALLY
AND EVEN GRATEFULLY WELCOMED; THE QUIET NEAT OLD LADY, WHO WITH HER
KNITTING WAS SEATED IN THE WARMEST CORNER, WANTING EVEN TO GIVE UP
HER PLACE TO MISS WOODHOUSE, AND HER MORE ACTIVE, TALKING DAUGHTER,
ALMOST READY TO OVERPOWER THEM WITH CARE AND KINDNESS, THANKS FOR
THEIR VISIT, SOLICITUDE FOR THEIR SHOES, ANXIOUS INQUIRIES AFTER
MR. WOODHOUSE'S HEALTH, CHEERFUL COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT HER MOTHER'S,
AND SWEET-CAKE FROM THE BEAUFET--"MRS. COLE HAD JUST BEEN THERE,
JUST CALLED IN FOR TEN MINUTES, AND HAD BEEN SO GOOD AS TO SIT AN
HOUR WITH THEM, AND _SHE_ HAD TAKEN A PIECE OF CAKE AND BEEN SO KIND
AS TO SAY SHE LIKED IT VERY MUCH; AND, THEREFORE, SHE HOPED MISS
WOODHOUSE AND MISS SMITH WOULD DO THEM THE FAVOUR TO EAT A PIECE TOO."

THE MENTION OF THE COLES WAS SURE TO BE FOLLOWED BY THAT OF MR. ELTON.
THERE WAS INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM, AND MR. COLE HAD HEARD FROM
MR. ELTON SINCE HIS GOING AWAY.  EMMA KNEW WHAT WAS COMING; THEY MUST
HAVE THE LETTER OVER AGAIN, AND SETTLE HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN GONE,
AND HOW MUCH HE WAS ENGAGED IN COMPANY, AND WHAT A FAVOURITE HE
WAS WHEREVER HE WENT, AND HOW FULL THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES'
BALL HAD BEEN; AND SHE WENT THROUGH IT VERY WELL, WITH ALL THE
INTEREST AND ALL THE COMMENDATION THAT COULD BE REQUISITE, AND ALWAYS
PUTTING FORWARD TO PREVENT HARRIET'S BEING OBLIGED TO SAY A WORD.

THIS SHE HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE;
BUT MEANT, HAVING ONCE TALKED HIM HANDSOMELY OVER, TO BE NO FARTHER
INCOMMODED BY ANY TROUBLESOME TOPIC, AND TO WANDER AT LARGE AMONGST
ALL THE MISTRESSES AND MISSES OF HIGHBURY, AND THEIR CARD-PARTIES.
SHE HAD NOT BEEN PREPARED TO HAVE JANE FAIRFAX SUCCEED MR. ELTON;
BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY HURRIED OFF BY MISS BATES, SHE JUMPED AWAY
FROM HIM AT LAST ABRUPTLY TO THE COLES, TO USHER IN A LETTER FROM
HER NIECE.

"OH! YES--MR. ELTON, I UNDERSTAND--CERTAINLY AS TO DANCING--
MRS. COLE WAS TELLING ME THAT DANCING AT THE ROOMS AT BATH WAS--
MRS. COLE WAS SO KIND AS TO SIT SOME TIME WITH US, TALKING OF JANE;
FOR AS SOON AS SHE CAME IN, SHE BEGAN INQUIRING AFTER HER,
JANE IS SO VERY GREAT A FAVOURITE THERE.  WHENEVER SHE IS WITH US,
MRS. COLE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO SHEW HER KINDNESS ENOUGH;
AND I MUST SAY THAT JANE DESERVES IT AS MUCH AS ANY BODY CAN.
AND SO SHE BEGAN INQUIRING AFTER HER DIRECTLY, SAYING, `I KNOW YOU
CANNOT HAVE HEARD FROM JANE LATELY, BECAUSE IT IS NOT HER TIME
FOR WRITING;' AND WHEN I IMMEDIATELY SAID, `BUT INDEED WE HAVE,
WE HAD A LETTER THIS VERY MORNING,' I DO NOT KNOW THAT I EVER SAW
ANY BODY MORE SURPRIZED.  `HAVE YOU, UPON YOUR HONOUR?' SAID SHE;
`WELL, THAT IS QUITE UNEXPECTED.  DO LET ME HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS.'"

EMMA'S POLITENESS WAS AT HAND DIRECTLY, TO SAY, WITH SMILING INTEREST--

"HAVE YOU HEARD FROM MISS FAIRFAX SO LATELY?  I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY.
I HOPE SHE IS WELL?"

"THANK YOU.  YOU ARE SO KIND!" REPLIED THE HAPPILY DECEIVED AUNT,
WHILE EAGERLY HUNTING FOR THE LETTER.--"OH! HERE IT IS.  I WAS SURE
IT COULD NOT BE FAR OFF; BUT I HAD PUT MY HUSWIFE UPON IT, YOU SEE,
WITHOUT BEING AWARE, AND SO IT WAS QUITE HID, BUT I HAD IT IN MY HAND
SO VERY LATELY THAT I WAS ALMOST SURE IT MUST BE ON THE TABLE.
I WAS READING IT TO MRS. COLE, AND SINCE SHE WENT AWAY, I WAS
READING IT AGAIN TO MY MOTHER, FOR IT IS SUCH A PLEASURE TO HER--
A LETTER FROM JANE--THAT SHE CAN NEVER HEAR IT OFTEN ENOUGH;
SO I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE FAR OFF, AND HERE IT IS, ONLY JUST UNDER
MY HUSWIFE--AND SINCE YOU ARE SO KIND AS TO WISH TO HEAR WHAT
SHE SAYS;--BUT, FIRST OF ALL, I REALLY MUST, IN JUSTICE TO JANE,
APOLOGISE FOR HER WRITING SO SHORT A LETTER--ONLY TWO PAGES YOU SEE--
HARDLY TWO--AND IN GENERAL SHE FILLS THE WHOLE PAPER AND CROSSES HALF.
MY MOTHER OFTEN WONDERS THAT I CAN MAKE IT OUT SO WELL.
SHE OFTEN SAYS, WHEN THE LETTER IS FIRST OPENED, `WELL, HETTY,
NOW I THINK YOU WILL BE PUT TO IT TO MAKE OUT ALL THAT CHECKER-WORK'--
DON'T YOU, MA'AM?--AND THEN I TELL HER, I AM SURE SHE WOULD CONTRIVE
TO MAKE IT OUT HERSELF, IF SHE HAD NOBODY TO DO IT FOR HER--
EVERY WORD OF IT--I AM SURE SHE WOULD PORE OVER IT TILL SHE HAD
MADE OUT EVERY WORD.  AND, INDEED, THOUGH MY MOTHER'S EYES ARE NOT
SO GOOD AS THEY WERE, SHE CAN SEE AMAZINGLY WELL STILL, THANK GOD!
WITH THE HELP OF SPECTACLES.  IT IS SUCH A BLESSING!  MY MOTHER'S
ARE REALLY VERY GOOD INDEED.  JANE OFTEN SAYS, WHEN SHE IS HERE,
`I AM SURE, GRANDMAMA, YOU MUST HAVE HAD VERY STRONG EYES TO SEE
AS YOU DO--AND SO MUCH FINE WORK AS YOU HAVE DONE TOO!--I ONLY WISH
MY EYES MAY LAST ME AS WELL.'"

ALL THIS SPOKEN EXTREMELY FAST OBLIGED MISS BATES TO STOP FOR BREATH;
AND EMMA SAID SOMETHING VERY CIVIL ABOUT THE EXCELLENCE OF MISS
FAIRFAX'S HANDWRITING.

"YOU ARE EXTREMELY KIND," REPLIED MISS BATES, HIGHLY GRATIFIED;
"YOU WHO ARE SUCH A JUDGE, AND WRITE SO BEAUTIFULLY YOURSELF.
I AM SURE THERE IS NOBODY'S PRAISE THAT COULD GIVE US SO MUCH PLEASURE
AS MISS WOODHOUSE'S. MY MOTHER DOES NOT HEAR; SHE IS A LITTLE DEAF
YOU KNOW.  MA'AM," ADDRESSING HER, "DO YOU HEAR WHAT MISS WOODHOUSE
IS SO OBLIGING TO SAY ABOUT JANE'S HANDWRITING?"

AND EMMA HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HEARING HER OWN SILLY COMPLIMENT
REPEATED TWICE OVER BEFORE THE GOOD OLD LADY COULD COMPREHEND IT.
SHE WAS PONDERING, IN THE MEANWHILE, UPON THE POSSIBILITY, WITHOUT SEEMING
VERY RUDE, OF MAKING HER ESCAPE FROM JANE FAIRFAX'S LETTER, AND HAD
ALMOST RESOLVED ON HURRYING AWAY DIRECTLY UNDER SOME SLIGHT EXCUSE,
WHEN MISS BATES TURNED TO HER AGAIN AND SEIZED HER ATTENTION.

"MY MOTHER'S DEAFNESS IS VERY TRIFLING YOU SEE--JUST NOTHING AT ALL.
BY ONLY RAISING MY VOICE, AND SAYING ANY THING TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER,
SHE IS SURE TO HEAR; BUT THEN SHE IS USED TO MY VOICE.  BUT IT IS VERY
REMARKABLE THAT SHE SHOULD ALWAYS HEAR JANE BETTER THAN SHE DOES ME.
JANE SPEAKS SO DISTINCT!  HOWEVER, SHE WILL NOT FIND HER GRANDMAMA
AT ALL DEAFER THAN SHE WAS TWO YEARS AGO; WHICH IS SAYING A GREAT
DEAL AT MY MOTHER'S TIME OF LIFE--AND IT REALLY IS FULL TWO YEARS,
YOU KNOW, SINCE SHE WAS HERE.  WE NEVER WERE SO LONG WITHOUT SEEING
HER BEFORE, AND AS I WAS TELLING MRS. COLE, WE SHALL HARDLY KNOW
HOW TO MAKE ENOUGH OF HER NOW."

"ARE YOU EXPECTING MISS FAIRFAX HERE SOON?"

"OH YES; NEXT WEEK."

"INDEED!--THAT MUST BE A VERY GREAT PLEASURE."

"THANK YOU.  YOU ARE VERY KIND.  YES, NEXT WEEK.  EVERY BODY IS
SO SURPRIZED; AND EVERY BODY SAYS THE SAME OBLIGING THINGS.  I AM
SURE SHE WILL BE AS HAPPY TO SEE HER FRIENDS AT HIGHBURY, AS THEY
CAN BE TO SEE HER.  YES, FRIDAY OR SATURDAY; SHE CANNOT SAY WHICH,
BECAUSE COLONEL CAMPBELL WILL BE WANTING THE CARRIAGE HIMSELF ONE
OF THOSE DAYS.  SO VERY GOOD OF THEM TO SEND HER THE WHOLE WAY!
BUT THEY ALWAYS DO, YOU KNOW.  OH YES, FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NEXT.
THAT IS WHAT SHE WRITES ABOUT.  THAT IS THE REASON OF HER WRITING OUT
OF RULE, AS WE CALL IT; FOR, IN THE COMMON COURSE, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE
HEARD FROM HER BEFORE NEXT TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY."

"YES, SO I IMAGINED.  I WAS AFRAID THERE COULD BE LITTLE CHANCE
OF MY HEARING ANY THING OF MISS FAIRFAX TO-DAY."

"SO OBLIGING OF YOU!  NO, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HEARD, IF IT HAD NOT
BEEN FOR THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE, OF HER BEING TO COME HERE
SO SOON.  MY MOTHER IS SO DELIGHTED!--FOR SHE IS TO BE THREE MONTHS
WITH US AT LEAST.  THREE MONTHS, SHE SAYS SO, POSITIVELY, AS I
AM GOING TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF READING TO YOU.  THE CASE IS,
YOU SEE, THAT THE CAMPBELLS ARE GOING TO IRELAND.  MRS. DIXON HAS
PERSUADED HER FATHER AND MOTHER TO COME OVER AND SEE HER DIRECTLY.
THEY HAD NOT INTENDED TO GO OVER TILL THE SUMMER, BUT SHE IS SO
IMPATIENT TO SEE THEM AGAIN--FOR TILL SHE MARRIED, LAST OCTOBER,
SHE WAS NEVER AWAY FROM THEM SO MUCH AS A WEEK, WHICH MUST MAKE
IT VERY STRANGE TO BE IN DIFFERENT KINGDOMS, I WAS GOING TO SAY,
BUT HOWEVER DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND SO SHE WROTE A VERY URGENT LETTER
TO HER MOTHER--OR HER FATHER, I DECLARE I DO NOT KNOW WHICH IT WAS,
BUT WE SHALL SEE PRESENTLY IN JANE'S LETTER--WROTE IN MR. DIXON'S
NAME AS WELL AS HER OWN, TO PRESS THEIR COMING OVER DIRECTLY,
AND THEY WOULD GIVE THEM THE MEETING IN DUBLIN, AND TAKE THEM BACK
TO THEIR COUNTRY SEAT, BALY-CRAIG, A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, I FANCY.
JANE HAS HEARD A GREAT DEAL OF ITS BEAUTY; FROM MR. DIXON, I MEAN--
I DO NOT KNOW THAT SHE EVER HEARD ABOUT IT FROM ANY BODY ELSE;
BUT IT WAS VERY NATURAL, YOU KNOW, THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK
OF HIS OWN PLACE WHILE HE WAS PAYING HIS ADDRESSES--AND AS JANE USED
TO BE VERY OFTEN WALKING OUT WITH THEM--FOR COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL
WERE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THEIR DAUGHTER'S NOT WALKING OUT
OFTEN WITH ONLY MR. DIXON, FOR WHICH I DO NOT AT ALL BLAME THEM;
OF COURSE SHE HEARD EVERY THING HE MIGHT BE TELLING MISS CAMPBELL
ABOUT HIS OWN HOME IN IRELAND; AND I THINK SHE WROTE US WORD
THAT HE HAD SHEWN THEM SOME DRAWINGS OF THE PLACE, VIEWS THAT HE
HAD TAKEN HIMSELF.  HE IS A MOST AMIABLE, CHARMING YOUNG MAN,
I BELIEVE.  JANE WAS QUITE LONGING TO GO TO IRELAND, FROM HIS ACCOUNT
OF THINGS."

AT THIS MOMENT, AN INGENIOUS AND ANIMATING SUSPICION ENTERING
EMMA'S BRAIN WITH REGARD TO JANE FAIRFAX, THIS CHARMING MR. DIXON,
AND THE NOT GOING TO IRELAND, SHE SAID, WITH THE INSIDIOUS DESIGN
OF FARTHER DISCOVERY,

"YOU MUST FEEL IT VERY FORTUNATE THAT MISS FAIRFAX SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO COME TO YOU AT SUCH A TIME.  CONSIDERING THE VERY PARTICULAR
FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN HER AND MRS. DIXON, YOU COULD HARDLY HAVE EXPECTED
HER TO BE EXCUSED FROM ACCOMPANYING COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL."

"VERY TRUE, VERY TRUE, INDEED.  THE VERY THING THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN RATHER AFRAID OF; FOR WE SHOULD NOT HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HER
AT SUCH A DISTANCE FROM US, FOR MONTHS TOGETHER--NOT ABLE TO COME
IF ANY THING WAS TO HAPPEN.  BUT YOU SEE, EVERY THING TURNS OUT
FOR THE BEST.  THEY WANT HER (MR. AND MRS. DIXON) EXCESSIVELY TO
COME OVER WITH COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL; QUITE DEPEND UPON IT;
NOTHING CAN BE MORE KIND OR PRESSING THAN THEIR _JOINT_ INVITATION,
JANE SAYS, AS YOU WILL HEAR PRESENTLY; MR. DIXON DOES NOT SEEM IN THE
LEAST BACKWARD IN ANY ATTENTION.  HE IS A MOST CHARMING YOUNG MAN.
EVER SINCE THE SERVICE HE RENDERED JANE AT WEYMOUTH, WHEN THEY WERE
OUT IN THAT PARTY ON THE WATER, AND SHE, BY THE SUDDEN WHIRLING
ROUND OF SOMETHING OR OTHER AMONG THE SAILS, WOULD HAVE BEEN DASHED
INTO THE SEA AT ONCE, AND ACTUALLY WAS ALL BUT GONE, IF HE HAD NOT,
WITH THE GREATEST PRESENCE OF MIND, CAUGHT HOLD OF HER HABIT--
(I CAN NEVER THINK OF IT WITHOUT TREMBLING!)--BUT EVER SINCE WE
HAD THE HISTORY OF THAT DAY, I HAVE BEEN SO FOND OF MR. DIXON!"

"BUT, IN SPITE OF ALL HER FRIENDS' URGENCY, AND HER OWN WISH
OF SEEING IRELAND, MISS FAIRFAX PREFERS DEVOTING THE TIME TO YOU
AND MRS. BATES?"

"YES--ENTIRELY HER OWN DOING, ENTIRELY HER OWN CHOICE; AND COLONEL
AND MRS. CAMPBELL THINK SHE DOES QUITE RIGHT, JUST WHAT THEY
SHOULD RECOMMEND; AND INDEED THEY PARTICULARLY _WISH_ HER TO TRY
HER NATIVE AIR, AS SHE HAS NOT BEEN QUITE SO WELL AS USUAL LATELY."

"I AM CONCERNED TO HEAR OF IT.  I THINK THEY JUDGE WISELY.
BUT MRS. DIXON MUST BE VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED.  MRS. DIXON,
I UNDERSTAND, HAS NO REMARKABLE DEGREE OF PERSONAL BEAUTY; IS NOT,
BY ANY MEANS, TO BE COMPARED WITH MISS FAIRFAX."

"OH! NO.  YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING TO SAY SUCH THINGS--BUT CERTAINLY NOT.
THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THEM.  MISS CAMPBELL ALWAYS WAS
ABSOLUTELY PLAIN--BUT EXTREMELY ELEGANT AND AMIABLE."

"YES, THAT OF COURSE."

"JANE CAUGHT A BAD COLD, POOR THING! SO LONG AGO AS THE 7TH
OF NOVEMBER, (AS I AM GOING TO READ TO YOU,) AND HAS NEVER BEEN
WELL SINCE.  A LONG TIME, IS NOT IT, FOR A COLD TO HANG UPON HER?
SHE NEVER MENTIONED IT BEFORE, BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT ALARM US.
JUST LIKE HER! SO CONSIDERATE!--BUT HOWEVER, SHE IS SO FAR FROM WELL,
THAT HER KIND FRIENDS THE CAMPBELLS THINK SHE HAD BETTER COME HOME,
AND TRY AN AIR THAT ALWAYS AGREES WITH HER; AND THEY HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AT HIGHBURY WILL ENTIRELY CURE HER--
AND IT IS CERTAINLY A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAT SHE SHOULD COME HERE,
THAN GO TO IRELAND, IF SHE IS UNWELL. NOBODY COULD NURSE HER, AS WE
SHOULD DO."

"IT APPEARS TO ME THE MOST DESIRABLE ARRANGEMENT IN THE WORLD."

"AND SO SHE IS TO COME TO US NEXT FRIDAY OR SATURDAY, AND THE
CAMPBELLS LEAVE TOWN IN THEIR WAY TO HOLYHEAD THE MONDAY FOLLOWING--
AS YOU WILL FIND FROM JANE'S LETTER.  SO SUDDEN!--YOU MAY GUESS,
DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, WHAT A FLURRY IT HAS THROWN ME IN!
IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE DRAWBACK OF HER ILLNESS--BUT I AM AFRAID
WE MUST EXPECT TO SEE HER GROWN THIN, AND LOOKING VERY POORLY.
I MUST TELL YOU WHAT AN UNLUCKY THING HAPPENED TO ME, AS TO THAT.
I ALWAYS MAKE A POINT OF READING JANE'S LETTERS THROUGH TO MYSELF FIRST,
BEFORE I READ THEM ALOUD TO MY MOTHER, YOU KNOW, FOR FEAR OF THERE
BEING ANY THING IN THEM TO DISTRESS HER.  JANE DESIRED ME TO DO IT,
SO I ALWAYS DO:  AND SO I BEGAN TO-DAY WITH MY USUAL CAUTION;
BUT NO SOONER DID I COME TO THE MENTION OF HER BEING UNWELL, THAN I
BURST OUT, QUITE FRIGHTENED, WITH `BLESS ME! POOR JANE IS ILL!'--
WHICH MY MOTHER, BEING ON THE WATCH, HEARD DISTINCTLY, AND WAS SADLY
ALARMED AT.  HOWEVER, WHEN I READ ON, I FOUND IT WAS NOT NEAR SO BAD
AS I HAD FANCIED AT FIRST; AND I MAKE SO LIGHT OF IT NOW TO HER,
THAT SHE DOES NOT THINK MUCH ABOUT IT.  BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE
HOW I COULD BE SO OFF MY GUARD.  IF JANE DOES NOT GET WELL SOON,
WE WILL CALL IN MR. PERRY.  THE EXPENSE SHALL NOT BE THOUGHT OF;
AND THOUGH HE IS SO LIBERAL, AND SO FOND OF JANE THAT I DARE SAY
HE WOULD NOT MEAN TO CHARGE ANY THING FOR ATTENDANCE, WE COULD NOT
SUFFER IT TO BE SO, YOU KNOW.  HE HAS A WIFE AND FAMILY TO MAINTAIN,
AND IS NOT TO BE GIVING AWAY HIS TIME.  WELL, NOW I HAVE JUST GIVEN YOU
A HINT OF WHAT JANE WRITES ABOUT, WE WILL TURN TO HER LETTER, AND I AM
SURE SHE TELLS HER OWN STORY A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN I CAN TELL IT
FOR HER."

"I AM AFRAID WE MUST BE RUNNING AWAY," SAID EMMA, GLANCING AT HARRIET,
AND BEGINNING TO RISE--"MY FATHER WILL BE EXPECTING US.
I HAD NO INTENTION, I THOUGHT I HAD NO POWER OF STAYING MORE THAN
FIVE MINUTES, WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THE HOUSE.  I MERELY CALLED,
BECAUSE I WOULD NOT PASS THE DOOR WITHOUT INQUIRING AFTER MRS. BATES;
BUT I HAVE BEEN SO PLEASANTLY DETAINED!  NOW, HOWEVER, WE MUST WISH
YOU AND MRS. BATES GOOD MORNING."

AND NOT ALL THAT COULD BE URGED TO DETAIN HER SUCCEEDED.
SHE REGAINED THE STREET--HAPPY IN THIS, THAT THOUGH MUCH HAD BEEN
FORCED ON HER AGAINST HER WILL, THOUGH SHE HAD IN FACT HEARD
THE WHOLE SUBSTANCE OF JANE FAIRFAX'S LETTER, SHE HAD BEEN ABLE
TO ESCAPE THE LETTER ITSELF.



CHAPTER II


JANE FAIRFAX WAS AN ORPHAN, THE ONLY CHILD OF MRS. BATES'S
YOUNGEST DAUGHTER.

THE MARRIAGE OF LIEUT. FAIRFAX OF THE _______ REGIMENT OF INFANTRY,
AND MISS JANE BATES, HAD HAD ITS DAY OF FAME AND PLEASURE,
HOPE AND INTEREST; BUT NOTHING NOW REMAINED OF IT, SAVE THE MELANCHOLY
REMEMBRANCE OF HIM DYING IN ACTION ABROAD--OF HIS WIDOW SINKING
UNDER CONSUMPTION AND GRIEF SOON AFTERWARDS--AND THIS GIRL.

BY BIRTH SHE BELONGED TO HIGHBURY:  AND WHEN AT THREE YEARS OLD,
ON LOSING HER MOTHER, SHE BECAME THE PROPERTY, THE CHARGE,
THE CONSOLATION, THE FONDLING OF HER GRANDMOTHER AND AUNT, THERE HAD
SEEMED EVERY PROBABILITY OF HER BEING PERMANENTLY FIXED THERE;
OF HER BEING TAUGHT ONLY WHAT VERY LIMITED MEANS COULD COMMAND,
AND GROWING UP WITH NO ADVANTAGES OF CONNEXION OR IMPROVEMENT,
TO BE ENGRAFTED ON WHAT NATURE HAD GIVEN HER IN A PLEASING PERSON,
GOOD UNDERSTANDING, AND WARM-HEARTED, WELL-MEANING RELATIONS.

BUT THE COMPASSIONATE FEELINGS OF A FRIEND OF HER FATHER GAVE
A CHANGE TO HER DESTINY.  THIS WAS COLONEL CAMPBELL, WHO HAD
VERY HIGHLY REGARDED FAIRFAX, AS AN EXCELLENT OFFICER AND MOST
DESERVING YOUNG MAN; AND FARTHER, HAD BEEN INDEBTED TO HIM FOR
SUCH ATTENTIONS, DURING A SEVERE CAMP-FEVER, AS HE BELIEVED HAD SAVED
HIS LIFE.  THESE WERE CLAIMS WHICH HE DID NOT LEARN TO OVERLOOK,
THOUGH SOME YEARS PASSED AWAY FROM THE DEATH OF POOR FAIRFAX,
BEFORE HIS OWN RETURN TO ENGLAND PUT ANY THING IN HIS POWER.
WHEN HE DID RETURN, HE SOUGHT OUT THE CHILD AND TOOK NOTICE OF HER.
HE WAS A MARRIED MAN, WITH ONLY ONE LIVING CHILD, A GIRL,
ABOUT JANE'S AGE:  AND JANE BECAME THEIR GUEST, PAYING THEM LONG VISITS
AND GROWING A FAVOURITE WITH ALL; AND BEFORE SHE WAS NINE YEARS OLD,
HIS DAUGHTER'S GREAT FONDNESS FOR HER, AND HIS OWN WISH OF BEING
A REAL FRIEND, UNITED TO PRODUCE AN OFFER FROM COLONEL CAMPBELL
OF UNDERTAKING THE WHOLE CHARGE OF HER EDUCATION.  IT WAS ACCEPTED;
AND FROM THAT PERIOD JANE HAD BELONGED TO COLONEL CAMPBELL'S FAMILY,
AND HAD LIVED WITH THEM ENTIRELY, ONLY VISITING HER GRANDMOTHER
FROM TIME TO TIME.

THE PLAN WAS THAT SHE SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP FOR EDUCATING OTHERS;
THE VERY FEW HUNDRED POUNDS WHICH SHE INHERITED FROM HER FATHER
MAKING INDEPENDENCE IMPOSSIBLE.  TO PROVIDE FOR HER OTHERWISE
WAS OUT OF COLONEL CAMPBELL'S POWER; FOR THOUGH HIS INCOME, BY PAY
AND APPOINTMENTS, WAS HANDSOME, HIS FORTUNE WAS MODERATE AND MUST
BE ALL HIS DAUGHTER'S; BUT, BY GIVING HER AN EDUCATION, HE HOPED
TO BE SUPPLYING THE MEANS OF RESPECTABLE SUBSISTENCE HEREAFTER.

SUCH WAS JANE FAIRFAX'S HISTORY.  SHE HAD FALLEN INTO GOOD HANDS,
KNOWN NOTHING BUT KINDNESS FROM THE CAMPBELLS, AND BEEN GIVEN
AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION.  LIVING CONSTANTLY WITH RIGHT-MINDED
AND WELL-INFORMED PEOPLE, HER HEART AND UNDERSTANDING HAD RECEIVED
EVERY ADVANTAGE OF DISCIPLINE AND CULTURE; AND COLONEL CAMPBELL'S
RESIDENCE BEING IN LONDON, EVERY LIGHTER TALENT HAD BEEN DONE
FULL JUSTICE TO, BY THE ATTENDANCE OF FIRST-RATE MASTERS.
HER DISPOSITION AND ABILITIES WERE EQUALLY WORTHY OF ALL THAT
FRIENDSHIP COULD DO; AND AT EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN SHE WAS, AS FAR
AS SUCH AN EARLY AGE CAN BE QUALIFIED FOR THE CARE OF CHILDREN,
FULLY COMPETENT TO THE OFFICE OF INSTRUCTION HERSELF; BUT SHE
WAS TOO MUCH BELOVED TO BE PARTED WITH.  NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER
COULD PROMOTE, AND THE DAUGHTER COULD NOT ENDURE IT.  THE EVIL DAY
WAS PUT OFF.  IT WAS EASY TO DECIDE THAT SHE WAS STILL TOO YOUNG;
AND JANE REMAINED WITH THEM, SHARING, AS ANOTHER DAUGHTER, IN ALL
THE RATIONAL PLEASURES OF AN ELEGANT SOCIETY, AND A JUDICIOUS
MIXTURE OF HOME AND AMUSEMENT, WITH ONLY THE DRAWBACK OF THE FUTURE,
THE SOBERING SUGGESTIONS OF HER OWN GOOD UNDERSTANDING TO REMIND
HER THAT ALL THIS MIGHT SOON BE OVER.

THE AFFECTION OF THE WHOLE FAMILY, THE WARM ATTACHMENT OF MISS
CAMPBELL IN PARTICULAR, WAS THE MORE HONOURABLE TO EACH PARTY
FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF JANE'S DECIDED SUPERIORITY BOTH IN BEAUTY
AND ACQUIREMENTS.  THAT NATURE HAD GIVEN IT IN FEATURE COULD NOT
BE UNSEEN BY THE YOUNG WOMAN, NOR COULD HER HIGHER POWERS OF MIND
BE UNFELT BY THE PARENTS.  THEY CONTINUED TOGETHER WITH UNABATED
REGARD HOWEVER, TILL THE MARRIAGE OF MISS CAMPBELL, WHO BY THAT CHANCE,
THAT LUCK WHICH SO OFTEN DEFIES ANTICIPATION IN MATRIMONIAL AFFAIRS,
GIVING ATTRACTION TO WHAT IS MODERATE RATHER THAN TO WHAT IS SUPERIOR,
ENGAGED THE AFFECTIONS OF MR. DIXON, A YOUNG MAN, RICH AND AGREEABLE,
ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY WERE ACQUAINTED; AND WAS ELIGIBLY
AND HAPPILY SETTLED, WHILE JANE FAIRFAX HAD YET HER BREAD TO EARN.

THIS EVENT HAD VERY LATELY TAKEN PLACE; TOO LATELY FOR ANY THING TO BE
YET ATTEMPTED BY HER LESS FORTUNATE FRIEND TOWARDS ENTERING ON HER PATH
OF DUTY; THOUGH SHE HAD NOW REACHED THE AGE WHICH HER OWN JUDGMENT
HAD FIXED ON FOR BEGINNING.  SHE HAD LONG RESOLVED THAT ONE-AND-TWENTY
SHOULD BE THE PERIOD.  WITH THE FORTITUDE OF A DEVOTED NOVITIATE,
SHE HAD RESOLVED AT ONE-AND-TWENTY TO COMPLETE THE SACRIFICE,
AND RETIRE FROM ALL THE PLEASURES OF LIFE, OF RATIONAL INTERCOURSE,
EQUAL SOCIETY, PEACE AND HOPE, TO PENANCE AND MORTIFICATION FOR EVER.

THE GOOD SENSE OF COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL COULD NOT OPPOSE SUCH
A RESOLUTION, THOUGH THEIR FEELINGS DID.  AS LONG AS THEY LIVED,
NO EXERTIONS WOULD BE NECESSARY, THEIR HOME MIGHT BE HERS FOR EVER;
AND FOR THEIR OWN COMFORT THEY WOULD HAVE RETAINED HER WHOLLY;
BUT THIS WOULD BE SELFISHNESS:--WHAT MUST BE AT LAST, HAD BETTER
BE SOON.  PERHAPS THEY BEGAN TO FEEL IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN KINDER
AND WISER TO HAVE RESISTED THE TEMPTATION OF ANY DELAY, AND SPARED
HER FROM A TASTE OF SUCH ENJOYMENTS OF EASE AND LEISURE AS MUST
NOW BE RELINQUISHED.  STILL, HOWEVER, AFFECTION WAS GLAD TO CATCH
AT ANY REASONABLE EXCUSE FOR NOT HURRYING ON THE WRETCHED MOMENT.
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN QUITE WELL SINCE THE TIME OF THEIR DAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE;
AND TILL SHE SHOULD HAVE COMPLETELY RECOVERED HER USUAL STRENGTH,
THEY MUST FORBID HER ENGAGING IN DUTIES, WHICH, SO FAR FROM BEING
COMPATIBLE WITH A WEAKENED FRAME AND VARYING SPIRITS, SEEMED,
UNDER THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES, TO REQUIRE SOMETHING
MORE THAN HUMAN PERFECTION OF BODY AND MIND TO BE DISCHARGED WITH
TOLERABLE COMFORT.

WITH REGARD TO HER NOT ACCOMPANYING THEM TO IRELAND, HER ACCOUNT
TO HER AUNT CONTAINED NOTHING BUT TRUTH, THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE SOME
TRUTHS NOT TOLD.  IT WAS HER OWN CHOICE TO GIVE THE TIME OF THEIR
ABSENCE TO HIGHBURY; TO SPEND, PERHAPS, HER LAST MONTHS OF PERFECT
LIBERTY WITH THOSE KIND RELATIONS TO WHOM SHE WAS SO VERY DEAR:
AND THE CAMPBELLS, WHATEVER MIGHT BE THEIR MOTIVE OR MOTIVES,
WHETHER SINGLE, OR DOUBLE, OR TREBLE, GAVE THE ARRANGEMENT
THEIR READY SANCTION, AND SAID, THAT THEY DEPENDED MORE ON A FEW
MONTHS SPENT IN HER NATIVE AIR, FOR THE RECOVERY OF HER HEALTH,
THAN ON ANY THING ELSE.  CERTAIN IT WAS THAT SHE WAS TO COME;
AND THAT HIGHBURY, INSTEAD OF WELCOMING THAT PERFECT NOVELTY WHICH
HAD BEEN SO LONG PROMISED IT--MR. FRANK CHURCHILL--MUST PUT UP FOR
THE PRESENT WITH JANE FAIRFAX, WHO COULD BRING ONLY THE FRESHNESS
OF A TWO YEARS' ABSENCE.

EMMA WAS SORRY;--TO HAVE TO PAY CIVILITIES TO A PERSON SHE DID
NOT LIKE THROUGH THREE LONG MONTHS!--TO BE ALWAYS DOING MORE THAN
SHE WISHED, AND LESS THAN SHE OUGHT!  WHY SHE DID NOT LIKE JANE
FAIRFAX MIGHT BE A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER; MR. KNIGHTLEY
HAD ONCE TOLD HER IT WAS BECAUSE SHE SAW IN HER THE REALLY
ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG WOMAN, WHICH SHE WANTED TO BE THOUGHT HERSELF;
AND THOUGH THE ACCUSATION HAD BEEN EAGERLY REFUTED AT THE TIME,
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SELF-EXAMINATION IN WHICH HER CONSCIENCE COULD
NOT QUITE ACQUIT HER.  BUT "SHE COULD NEVER GET ACQUAINTED WITH HER:
SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS, BUT THERE WAS SUCH COLDNESS AND RESERVE--
SUCH APPARENT INDIFFERENCE WHETHER SHE PLEASED OR NOT--AND THEN,
HER AUNT WAS SUCH AN ETERNAL TALKER!--AND SHE WAS MADE SUCH A FUSS
WITH BY EVERY BODY!--AND IT HAD BEEN ALWAYS IMAGINED THAT THEY WERE
TO BE SO INTIMATE--BECAUSE THEIR AGES WERE THE SAME, EVERY BODY HAD
SUPPOSED THEY MUST BE SO FOND OF EACH OTHER."  THESE WERE HER REASONS--
SHE HAD NO BETTER.

IT WAS A DISLIKE SO LITTLE JUST--EVERY IMPUTED FAULT WAS SO MAGNIFIED
BY FANCY, THAT SHE NEVER SAW JANE FAIRFAX THE FIRST TIME AFTER ANY
CONSIDERABLE ABSENCE, WITHOUT FEELING THAT SHE HAD INJURED HER;
AND NOW, WHEN THE DUE VISIT WAS PAID, ON HER ARRIVAL, AFTER A TWO YEARS'
INTERVAL, SHE WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE VERY APPEARANCE
AND MANNERS, WHICH FOR THOSE TWO WHOLE YEARS SHE HAD BEEN DEPRECIATING.
JANE FAIRFAX WAS VERY ELEGANT, REMARKABLY ELEGANT; AND SHE HAD
HERSELF THE HIGHEST VALUE FOR ELEGANCE.  HER HEIGHT WAS PRETTY,
JUST SUCH AS ALMOST EVERY BODY WOULD THINK TALL, AND NOBODY COULD
THINK VERY TALL; HER FIGURE PARTICULARLY GRACEFUL; HER SIZE A MOST
BECOMING MEDIUM, BETWEEN FAT AND THIN, THOUGH A SLIGHT APPEARANCE
OF ILL-HEALTH SEEMED TO POINT OUT THE LIKELIEST EVIL OF THE TWO.
EMMA COULD NOT BUT FEEL ALL THIS; AND THEN, HER FACE--HER FEATURES--
THERE WAS MORE BEAUTY IN THEM ALTOGETHER THAN SHE HAD REMEMBERED;
IT WAS NOT REGULAR, BUT IT WAS VERY PLEASING BEAUTY.  HER EYES,
A DEEP GREY, WITH DARK EYE-LASHES AND EYEBROWS, HAD NEVER BEEN DENIED
THEIR PRAISE; BUT THE SKIN, WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO CAVIL AT,
AS WANTING COLOUR, HAD A CLEARNESS AND DELICACY WHICH REALLY NEEDED
NO FULLER BLOOM.  IT WAS A STYLE OF BEAUTY, OF WHICH ELEGANCE
WAS THE REIGNING CHARACTER, AND AS SUCH, SHE MUST, IN HONOUR,
BY ALL HER PRINCIPLES, ADMIRE IT:--ELEGANCE, WHICH, WHETHER OF PERSON
OR OF MIND, SHE SAW SO LITTLE IN HIGHBURY.  THERE, NOT TO BE VULGAR,
WAS DISTINCTION, AND MERIT.

IN SHORT, SHE SAT, DURING THE FIRST VISIT, LOOKING AT JANE FAIRFAX
WITH TWOFOLD COMPLACENCY; THE SENSE OF PLEASURE AND THE SENSE
OF RENDERING JUSTICE, AND WAS DETERMINING THAT SHE WOULD DISLIKE
HER NO LONGER.  WHEN SHE TOOK IN HER HISTORY, INDEED, HER SITUATION,
AS WELL AS HER BEAUTY; WHEN SHE CONSIDERED WHAT ALL THIS ELEGANCE
WAS DESTINED TO, WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SINK FROM, HOW SHE WAS GOING
TO LIVE, IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FEEL ANY THING BUT COMPASSION
AND RESPECT; ESPECIALLY, IF TO EVERY WELL-KNOWN PARTICULAR ENTITLING
HER TO INTEREST, WERE ADDED THE HIGHLY PROBABLE CIRCUMSTANCE
OF AN ATTACHMENT TO MR. DIXON, WHICH SHE HAD SO NATURALLY STARTED
TO HERSELF.  IN THAT CASE, NOTHING COULD BE MORE PITIABLE
OR MORE HONOURABLE THAN THE SACRIFICES SHE HAD RESOLVED ON.
EMMA WAS VERY WILLING NOW TO ACQUIT HER OF HAVING SEDUCED
MR. DIXON'S ACTIONS FROM HIS WIFE, OR OF ANY THING MISCHIEVOUS
WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD SUGGESTED AT FIRST.  IF IT WERE LOVE,
IT MIGHT BE SIMPLE, SINGLE, SUCCESSLESS LOVE ON HER SIDE ALONE.
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNCONSCIOUSLY SUCKING IN THE SAD POISON,
WHILE A SHARER OF HIS CONVERSATION WITH HER FRIEND; AND FROM THE BEST,
THE PUREST OF MOTIVES, MIGHT NOW BE DENYING HERSELF THIS VISIT
TO IRELAND, AND RESOLVING TO DIVIDE HERSELF EFFECTUALLY FROM
HIM AND HIS CONNEXIONS BY SOON BEGINNING HER CAREER OF LABORIOUS DUTY.

UPON THE WHOLE, EMMA LEFT HER WITH SUCH SOFTENED, CHARITABLE FEELINGS,
AS MADE HER LOOK AROUND IN WALKING HOME, AND LAMENT THAT HIGHBURY
AFFORDED NO YOUNG MAN WORTHY OF GIVING HER INDEPENDENCE;
NOBODY THAT SHE COULD WISH TO SCHEME ABOUT FOR HER.

THESE WERE CHARMING FEELINGS--BUT NOT LASTING.  BEFORE SHE HAD
COMMITTED HERSELF BY ANY PUBLIC PROFESSION OF ETERNAL FRIENDSHIP FOR
JANE FAIRFAX, OR DONE MORE TOWARDS A RECANTATION OF PAST PREJUDICES
AND ERRORS, THAN SAYING TO MR. KNIGHTLEY, "SHE CERTAINLY IS HANDSOME;
SHE IS BETTER THAN HANDSOME!"  JANE HAD SPENT AN EVENING AT HARTFIELD
WITH HER GRANDMOTHER AND AUNT, AND EVERY THING WAS RELAPSING MUCH
INTO ITS USUAL STATE.  FORMER PROVOCATIONS REAPPEARED.  THE AUNT
WAS AS TIRESOME AS EVER; MORE TIRESOME, BECAUSE ANXIETY FOR HER
HEALTH WAS NOW ADDED TO ADMIRATION OF HER POWERS; AND THEY HAD TO
LISTEN TO THE DESCRIPTION OF EXACTLY HOW LITTLE BREAD AND BUTTER
SHE ATE FOR BREAKFAST, AND HOW SMALL A SLICE OF MUTTON FOR DINNER,
AS WELL AS TO SEE EXHIBITIONS OF NEW CAPS AND NEW WORKBAGS FOR HER
MOTHER AND HERSELF; AND JANE'S OFFENCES ROSE AGAIN.  THEY HAD MUSIC;
EMMA WAS OBLIGED TO PLAY; AND THE THANKS AND PRAISE WHICH NECESSARILY
FOLLOWED APPEARED TO HER AN AFFECTATION OF CANDOUR, AN AIR
OF GREATNESS, MEANING ONLY TO SHEW OFF IN HIGHER STYLE HER OWN VERY
SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE.  SHE WAS, BESIDES, WHICH WAS THE WORST OF ALL,
SO COLD, SO CAUTIOUS!  THERE WAS NO GETTING AT HER REAL OPINION.
WRAPT UP IN A CLOAK OF POLITENESS, SHE SEEMED DETERMINED
TO HAZARD NOTHING.  SHE WAS DISGUSTINGLY, WAS SUSPICIOUSLY RESERVED.

IF ANY THING COULD BE MORE, WHERE ALL WAS MOST, SHE WAS MORE
RESERVED ON THE SUBJECT OF WEYMOUTH AND THE DIXONS THAN ANY THING.
SHE SEEMED BENT ON GIVING NO REAL INSIGHT INTO MR. DIXON'S CHARACTER,
OR HER OWN VALUE FOR HIS COMPANY, OR OPINION OF THE SUITABLENESS
OF THE MATCH.  IT WAS ALL GENERAL APPROBATION AND SMOOTHNESS;
NOTHING DELINEATED OR DISTINGUISHED.  IT DID HER NO SERVICE HOWEVER.
HER CAUTION WAS THROWN AWAY.  EMMA SAW ITS ARTIFICE, AND RETURNED
TO HER FIRST SURMISES.  THERE PROBABLY _WAS_ SOMETHING MORE TO CONCEAL
THAN HER OWN PREFERENCE; MR. DIXON, PERHAPS, HAD BEEN VERY NEAR
CHANGING ONE FRIEND FOR THE OTHER, OR BEEN FIXED ONLY TO MISS CAMPBELL,
FOR THE SAKE OF THE FUTURE TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS.

THE LIKE RESERVE PREVAILED ON OTHER TOPICS.  SHE AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL
HAD BEEN AT WEYMOUTH AT THE SAME TIME.  IT WAS KNOWN THAT THEY WERE
A LITTLE ACQUAINTED; BUT NOT A SYLLABLE OF REAL INFORMATION COULD EMMA
PROCURE AS TO WHAT HE TRULY WAS.  "WAS HE HANDSOME?"--"SHE BELIEVED
HE WAS RECKONED A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN."  "WAS HE AGREEABLE?"--
"HE WAS GENERALLY THOUGHT SO."  "DID HE APPEAR A SENSIBLE YOUNG MAN;
A YOUNG MAN OF INFORMATION?"--"AT A WATERING-PLACE, OR IN A COMMON
LONDON ACQUAINTANCE, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DECIDE ON SUCH POINTS.
MANNERS WERE ALL THAT COULD BE SAFELY JUDGED OF, UNDER A MUCH LONGER
KNOWLEDGE THAN THEY HAD YET HAD OF MR. CHURCHILL.  SHE BELIEVED
EVERY BODY FOUND HIS MANNERS PLEASING."  EMMA COULD NOT FORGIVE HER.



CHAPTER III


EMMA COULD NOT FORGIVE HER;--BUT AS NEITHER PROVOCATION NOR RESENTMENT
WERE DISCERNED BY MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHO HAD BEEN OF THE PARTY, AND HAD
SEEN ONLY PROPER ATTENTION AND PLEASING BEHAVIOUR ON EACH SIDE,
HE WAS EXPRESSING THE NEXT MORNING, BEING AT HARTFIELD AGAIN ON
BUSINESS WITH MR. WOODHOUSE, HIS APPROBATION OF THE WHOLE; NOT SO
OPENLY AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD HER FATHER BEEN OUT OF THE ROOM,
BUT SPEAKING PLAIN ENOUGH TO BE VERY INTELLIGIBLE TO EMMA.
HE HAD BEEN USED TO THINK HER UNJUST TO JANE, AND HAD NOW GREAT
PLEASURE IN MARKING AN IMPROVEMENT.

"A VERY PLEASANT EVENING," HE BEGAN, AS SOON AS MR. WOODHOUSE
HAD BEEN TALKED INTO WHAT WAS NECESSARY, TOLD THAT HE UNDERSTOOD,
AND THE PAPERS SWEPT AWAY;--"PARTICULARLY PLEASANT.  YOU AND MISS
FAIRFAX GAVE US SOME VERY GOOD MUSIC.  I DO NOT KNOW A MORE
LUXURIOUS STATE, SIR, THAN SITTING AT ONE'S EASE TO BE ENTERTAINED
A WHOLE EVENING BY TWO SUCH YOUNG WOMEN; SOMETIMES WITH MUSIC
AND SOMETIMES WITH CONVERSATION.  I AM SURE MISS FAIRFAX MUST
HAVE FOUND THE EVENING PLEASANT, EMMA.  YOU LEFT NOTHING UNDONE.
I WAS GLAD YOU MADE HER PLAY SO MUCH, FOR HAVING NO INSTRUMENT
AT HER GRANDMOTHER'S, IT MUST HAVE BEEN A REAL INDULGENCE."

"I AM HAPPY YOU APPROVED," SAID EMMA, SMILING; "BUT I HOPE I AM
NOT OFTEN DEFICIENT IN WHAT IS DUE TO GUESTS AT HARTFIELD."

"NO, MY DEAR," SAID HER FATHER INSTANTLY; "_THAT_ I AM SURE YOU
ARE NOT.  THERE IS NOBODY HALF SO ATTENTIVE AND CIVIL AS YOU ARE.
IF ANY THING, YOU ARE TOO ATTENTIVE.  THE MUFFIN LAST NIGHT--IF IT
HAD BEEN HANDED ROUND ONCE, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH."

"NO," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, NEARLY AT THE SAME TIME; "YOU ARE NOT
OFTEN DEFICIENT; NOT OFTEN DEFICIENT EITHER IN MANNER OR COMPREHENSION.
I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND ME, THEREFORE."

AN ARCH LOOK EXPRESSED--"I UNDERSTAND YOU WELL ENOUGH;" BUT SHE
SAID ONLY, "MISS FAIRFAX IS RESERVED."

"I ALWAYS TOLD YOU SHE WAS--A LITTLE; BUT YOU WILL SOON OVERCOME
ALL THAT PART OF HER RESERVE WHICH OUGHT TO BE OVERCOME, ALL THAT
HAS ITS FOUNDATION IN DIFFIDENCE.  WHAT ARISES FROM DISCRETION
MUST BE HONOURED."

"YOU THINK HER DIFFIDENT.  I DO NOT SEE IT."

"MY DEAR EMMA," SAID HE, MOVING FROM HIS CHAIR INTO ONE CLOSE
BY HER, "YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TELL ME, I HOPE, THAT YOU
HAD NOT A PLEASANT EVENING."

"OH! NO; I WAS PLEASED WITH MY OWN PERSEVERANCE IN ASKING QUESTIONS;
AND AMUSED TO THINK HOW LITTLE INFORMATION I OBTAINED."

"I AM DISAPPOINTED," WAS HIS ONLY ANSWER.

"I HOPE EVERY BODY HAD A PLEASANT EVENING," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE,
IN HIS QUIET WAY.  "I HAD.  ONCE, I FELT THE FIRE RATHER TOO MUCH;
BUT THEN I MOVED BACK MY CHAIR A LITTLE, A VERY LITTLE, AND IT DID
NOT DISTURB ME.  MISS BATES WAS VERY CHATTY AND GOOD-HUMOURED,
AS SHE ALWAYS IS, THOUGH SHE SPEAKS RATHER TOO QUICK.  HOWEVER,
SHE IS VERY AGREEABLE, AND MRS. BATES TOO, IN A DIFFERENT WAY.
I LIKE OLD FRIENDS; AND MISS JANE FAIRFAX IS A VERY PRETTY SORT OF
YOUNG LADY, A VERY PRETTY AND A VERY WELL-BEHAVED YOUNG LADY INDEED.
SHE MUST HAVE FOUND THE EVENING AGREEABLE, MR. KNIGHTLEY, BECAUSE SHE
HAD EMMA."

"TRUE, SIR; AND EMMA, BECAUSE SHE HAD MISS FAIRFAX."

EMMA SAW HIS ANXIETY, AND WISHING TO APPEASE IT, AT LEAST FOR
THE PRESENT, SAID, AND WITH A SINCERITY WHICH NO ONE COULD QUESTION--

"SHE IS A SORT OF ELEGANT CREATURE THAT ONE CANNOT KEEP ONE'S EYES FROM.
I AM ALWAYS WATCHING HER TO ADMIRE; AND I DO PITY HER FROM MY HEART."

MR. KNIGHTLEY LOOKED AS IF HE WERE MORE GRATIFIED THAN HE CARED
TO EXPRESS; AND BEFORE HE COULD MAKE ANY REPLY, MR. WOODHOUSE,
WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ON THE BATES'S, SAID--

"IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE SO CONFINED!
A GREAT PITY INDEED! AND I HAVE OFTEN WISHED--BUT IT IS SO LITTLE ONE
CAN VENTURE TO DO--SMALL, TRIFLING PRESENTS, OF ANY THING UNCOMMON--
NOW WE HAVE KILLED A PORKER, AND EMMA THINKS OF SENDING THEM
A LOIN OR A LEG; IT IS VERY SMALL AND DELICATE--HARTFIELD PORK IS
NOT LIKE ANY OTHER PORK--BUT STILL IT IS PORK--AND, MY DEAR EMMA,
UNLESS ONE COULD BE SURE OF THEIR MAKING IT INTO STEAKS, NICELY FRIED,
AS OURS ARE FRIED, WITHOUT THE SMALLEST GREASE, AND NOT ROAST IT,
FOR NO STOMACH CAN BEAR ROAST PORK--I THINK WE HAD BETTER SEND THE LEG--
DO NOT YOU THINK SO, MY DEAR?"

"MY DEAR PAPA, I SENT THE WHOLE HIND-QUARTER. I KNEW YOU WOULD WISH IT.
THERE WILL BE THE LEG TO BE SALTED, YOU KNOW, WHICH IS SO VERY NICE,
AND THE LOIN TO BE DRESSED DIRECTLY IN ANY MANNER THEY LIKE."

"THAT'S RIGHT, MY DEAR, VERY RIGHT.  I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE,
BUT THAT IS THE BEST WAY.  THEY MUST NOT OVER-SALT THE LEG; AND THEN,
IF IT IS NOT OVER-SALTED, AND IF IT IS VERY THOROUGHLY BOILED,
JUST AS SERLE BOILS OURS, AND EATEN VERY MODERATELY OF, WITH A
BOILED TURNIP, AND A LITTLE CARROT OR PARSNIP, I DO NOT CONSIDER
IT UNWHOLESOME."

"EMMA," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY PRESENTLY, "I HAVE A PIECE OF NEWS FOR YOU.
YOU LIKE NEWS--AND I HEARD AN ARTICLE IN MY WAY HITHER THAT I THINK
WILL INTEREST YOU."

"NEWS!  OH! YES, I ALWAYS LIKE NEWS.  WHAT IS IT?--WHY DO YOU
SMILE SO?--WHERE DID YOU HEAR IT?--AT RANDALLS?"

HE HAD TIME ONLY TO SAY,

"NO, NOT AT RANDALLS; I HAVE NOT BEEN NEAR RANDALLS," WHEN THE DOOR
WAS THROWN OPEN, AND MISS BATES AND MISS FAIRFAX WALKED INTO THE ROOM.
FULL OF THANKS, AND FULL OF NEWS, MISS BATES KNEW NOT WHICH TO
GIVE QUICKEST.  MR. KNIGHTLEY SOON SAW THAT HE HAD LOST HIS MOMENT,
AND THAT NOT ANOTHER SYLLABLE OF COMMUNICATION COULD REST WITH HIM.

"OH! MY DEAR SIR, HOW ARE YOU THIS MORNING?  MY DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE--
I COME QUITE OVER-POWERED. SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HIND-QUARTER OF PORK!
YOU ARE TOO BOUNTIFUL!  HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS?  MR. ELTON IS GOING
TO BE MARRIED."

EMMA HAD NOT HAD TIME EVEN TO THINK OF MR. ELTON, AND SHE WAS
SO COMPLETELY SURPRIZED THAT SHE COULD NOT AVOID A LITTLE START,
AND A LITTLE BLUSH, AT THE SOUND.

"THERE IS MY NEWS:--I THOUGHT IT WOULD INTEREST YOU,"
SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, WITH A SMILE WHICH IMPLIED A CONVICTION
OF SOME PART OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM.

"BUT WHERE COULD _YOU_ HEAR IT?" CRIED MISS BATES.  "WHERE COULD
YOU POSSIBLY HEAR IT, MR. KNIGHTLEY?  FOR IT IS NOT FIVE MINUTES
SINCE I RECEIVED MRS. COLE'S NOTE--NO, IT CANNOT BE MORE THAN FIVE--
OR AT LEAST TEN--FOR I HAD GOT MY BONNET AND SPENCER ON, JUST READY
TO COME OUT--I WAS ONLY GONE DOWN TO SPEAK TO PATTY AGAIN ABOUT
THE PORK--JANE WAS STANDING IN THE PASSAGE--WERE NOT YOU, JANE?--
FOR MY MOTHER WAS SO AFRAID THAT WE HAD NOT ANY SALTING-PAN
LARGE ENOUGH.  SO I SAID I WOULD GO DOWN AND SEE, AND JANE SAID,
`SHALL I GO DOWN INSTEAD? FOR I THINK YOU HAVE A LITTLE COLD,
AND PATTY HAS BEEN WASHING THE KITCHEN.'--`OH! MY DEAR,'
SAID I--WELL, AND JUST THEN CAME THE NOTE.  A MISS HAWKINS--
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.  A MISS HAWKINS OF BATH.  BUT, MR. KNIGHTLEY,
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE HEARD IT? FOR THE VERY MOMENT MR. COLE
TOLD MRS. COLE OF IT, SHE SAT DOWN AND WROTE TO ME.  A MISS HAWKINS--"

"I WAS WITH MR. COLE ON BUSINESS AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO.
HE HAD JUST READ ELTON'S LETTER AS I WAS SHEWN IN, AND HANDED IT
TO ME DIRECTLY."

"WELL! THAT IS QUITE--I SUPPOSE THERE NEVER WAS A PIECE OF NEWS MORE
GENERALLY INTERESTING.  MY DEAR SIR, YOU REALLY ARE TOO BOUNTIFUL.
MY MOTHER DESIRES HER VERY BEST COMPLIMENTS AND REGARDS, AND A
THOUSAND THANKS, AND SAYS YOU REALLY QUITE OPPRESS HER."

"WE CONSIDER OUR HARTFIELD PORK," REPLIED MR. WOODHOUSE--"INDEED IT
CERTAINLY IS, SO VERY SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER PORK, THAT EMMA AND I
CANNOT HAVE A GREATER PLEASURE THAN--"

"OH! MY DEAR SIR, AS MY MOTHER SAYS, OUR FRIENDS ARE ONLY TOO GOOD
TO US.  IF EVER THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO, WITHOUT HAVING GREAT WEALTH
THEMSELVES, HAD EVERY THING THEY COULD WISH FOR, I AM SURE IT IS US.
WE MAY WELL SAY THAT `OUR LOT IS CAST IN A GOODLY HERITAGE.'
WELL, MR. KNIGHTLEY, AND SO YOU ACTUALLY SAW THE LETTER; WELL--"

"IT WAS SHORT--MERELY TO ANNOUNCE--BUT CHEERFUL, EXULTING, OF COURSE."--
HERE WAS A SLY GLANCE AT EMMA.  "HE HAD BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO--
I FORGET THE PRECISE WORDS--ONE HAS NO BUSINESS TO REMEMBER THEM.
THE INFORMATION WAS, AS YOU STATE, THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED
TO A MISS HAWKINS.  BY HIS STYLE, I SHOULD IMAGINE IT JUST SETTLED."

"MR. ELTON GOING TO BE MARRIED!" SAID EMMA, AS SOON AS SHE COULD SPEAK.
"HE WILL HAVE EVERY BODY'S WISHES FOR HIS HAPPINESS."

"HE IS VERY YOUNG TO SETTLE," WAS MR. WOODHOUSE'S OBSERVATION.
"HE HAD BETTER NOT BE IN A HURRY.  HE SEEMED TO ME VERY WELL OFF
AS HE WAS.  WE WERE ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE HIM AT HARTFIELD."

"A NEW NEIGHBOUR FOR US ALL, MISS WOODHOUSE!" SAID MISS BATES,
JOYFULLY; "MY MOTHER IS SO PLEASED!--SHE SAYS SHE CANNOT
BEAR TO HAVE THE POOR OLD VICARAGE WITHOUT A MISTRESS.
THIS IS GREAT NEWS, INDEED.  JANE, YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
MR. ELTON!--NO WONDER THAT YOU HAVE SUCH A CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM."

JANE'S CURIOSITY DID NOT APPEAR OF THAT ABSORBING NATURE AS WHOLLY
TO OCCUPY HER.

"NO--I HAVE NEVER SEEN MR. ELTON," SHE REPLIED, STARTING ON THIS APPEAL;
"IS HE--IS HE A TALL MAN?"

"WHO SHALL ANSWER THAT QUESTION?" CRIED EMMA.  "MY FATHER WOULD
SAY `YES,' MR. KNIGHTLEY `NO;' AND MISS BATES AND I THAT HE IS
JUST THE HAPPY MEDIUM.  WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN HERE A LITTLE LONGER,
MISS FAIRFAX, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT MR. ELTON IS THE STANDARD
OF PERFECTION IN HIGHBURY, BOTH IN PERSON AND MIND."

"VERY TRUE, MISS WOODHOUSE, SO SHE WILL.  HE IS THE VERY BEST
YOUNG MAN--BUT, MY DEAR JANE, IF YOU REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY
HE WAS PRECISELY THE HEIGHT OF MR. PERRY.  MISS HAWKINS,--I DARE SAY,
AN EXCELLENT YOUNG WOMAN.  HIS EXTREME ATTENTION TO MY MOTHER--
WANTING HER TO SIT IN THE VICARAGE PEW, THAT SHE MIGHT HEAR THE BETTER,
FOR MY MOTHER IS A LITTLE DEAF, YOU KNOW--IT IS NOT MUCH, BUT SHE
DOES NOT HEAR QUITE QUICK.  JANE SAYS THAT COLONEL CAMPBELL IS A
LITTLE DEAF.  HE FANCIED BATHING MIGHT BE GOOD FOR IT--THE WARM BATH--
BUT SHE SAYS IT DID HIM NO LASTING BENEFIT.  COLONEL CAMPBELL,
YOU KNOW, IS QUITE OUR ANGEL.  AND MR. DIXON SEEMS A VERY CHARMING
YOUNG MAN, QUITE WORTHY OF HIM.  IT IS SUCH A HAPPINESS WHEN GOOD
PEOPLE GET TOGETHER--AND THEY ALWAYS DO.  NOW, HERE WILL BE MR. ELTON
AND MISS HAWKINS; AND THERE ARE THE COLES, SUCH VERY GOOD PEOPLE;
AND THE PERRYS--I SUPPOSE THERE NEVER WAS A HAPPIER OR A BETTER COUPLE
THAN MR. AND MRS. PERRY.  I SAY, SIR," TURNING TO MR. WOODHOUSE,
"I THINK THERE ARE FEW PLACES WITH SUCH SOCIETY AS HIGHBURY.
I ALWAYS SAY, WE ARE QUITE BLESSED IN OUR NEIGHBOURS.--MY DEAR SIR,
IF THERE IS ONE THING MY MOTHER LOVES BETTER THAN ANOTHER, IT IS PORK--
A ROAST LOIN OF PORK--"

"AS TO WHO, OR WHAT MISS HAWKINS IS, OR HOW LONG HE HAS BEEN
ACQUAINTED WITH HER," SAID EMMA, "NOTHING I SUPPOSE CAN BE KNOWN.
ONE FEELS THAT IT CANNOT BE A VERY LONG ACQUAINTANCE.  HE HAS BEEN
GONE ONLY FOUR WEEKS."

NOBODY HAD ANY INFORMATION TO GIVE; AND, AFTER A FEW MORE WONDERINGS,
EMMA SAID,

"YOU ARE SILENT, MISS FAIRFAX--BUT I HOPE YOU MEAN TO TAKE
AN INTEREST IN THIS NEWS.  YOU, WHO HAVE BEEN HEARING AND SEEING
SO MUCH OF LATE ON THESE SUBJECTS, WHO MUST HAVE BEEN SO DEEP
IN THE BUSINESS ON MISS CAMPBELL'S ACCOUNT--WE SHALL NOT EXCUSE
YOUR BEING INDIFFERENT ABOUT MR. ELTON AND MISS HAWKINS."

"WHEN I HAVE SEEN MR. ELTON," REPLIED JANE, "I DARE SAY I
SHALL BE INTERESTED--BUT I BELIEVE IT REQUIRES _THAT_ WITH ME.
AND AS IT IS SOME MONTHS SINCE MISS CAMPBELL MARRIED, THE IMPRESSION
MAY BE A LITTLE WORN OFF."

"YES, HE HAS BEEN GONE JUST FOUR WEEKS, AS YOU OBSERVE, MISS WOODHOUSE,"
SAID MISS BATES, "FOUR WEEKS YESTERDAY.--A MISS HAWKINS!--WELL, I HAD
ALWAYS RATHER FANCIED IT WOULD BE SOME YOUNG LADY HEREABOUTS;
NOT THAT I EVER--MRS. COLE ONCE WHISPERED TO ME--BUT I IMMEDIATELY SAID,
`NO, MR. ELTON IS A MOST WORTHY YOUNG MAN--BUT'--IN SHORT, I DO
NOT THINK I AM PARTICULARLY QUICK AT THOSE SORT OF DISCOVERIES.
I DO NOT PRETEND TO IT.  WHAT IS BEFORE ME, I SEE.  AT THE SAME TIME,
NOBODY COULD WONDER IF MR. ELTON SHOULD HAVE ASPIRED--MISS WOODHOUSE
LETS ME CHATTER ON, SO GOOD-HUMOUREDLY. SHE KNOWS I WOULD NOT
OFFEND FOR THE WORLD.  HOW DOES MISS SMITH DO?  SHE SEEMS QUITE
RECOVERED NOW.  HAVE YOU HEARD FROM MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY LATELY?
OH! THOSE DEAR LITTLE CHILDREN.  JANE, DO YOU KNOW I ALWAYS FANCY
MR. DIXON LIKE MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY.  I MEAN IN PERSON--TALL, AND WITH
THAT SORT OF LOOK--AND NOT VERY TALKATIVE."

"QUITE WRONG, MY DEAR AUNT; THERE IS NO LIKENESS AT ALL."

"VERY ODD! BUT ONE NEVER DOES FORM A JUST IDEA OF ANY BODY BEFOREHAND.
ONE TAKES UP A NOTION, AND RUNS AWAY WITH IT.  MR. DIXON, YOU SAY,
IS NOT, STRICTLY SPEAKING, HANDSOME?"

"HANDSOME!  OH! NO--FAR FROM IT--CERTAINLY PLAIN.  I TOLD YOU HE
WAS PLAIN."

"MY DEAR, YOU SAID THAT MISS CAMPBELL WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO BE PLAIN,
AND THAT YOU YOURSELF--"

"OH! AS FOR ME, MY JUDGMENT IS WORTH NOTHING.  WHERE I HAVE A REGARD,
I ALWAYS THINK A PERSON WELL-LOOKING. BUT I GAVE WHAT I BELIEVED
THE GENERAL OPINION, WHEN I CALLED HIM PLAIN."

"WELL, MY DEAR JANE, I BELIEVE WE MUST BE RUNNING AWAY.
THE WEATHER DOES NOT LOOK WELL, AND GRANDMAMA WILL BE UNEASY.
YOU ARE TOO OBLIGING, MY DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE; BUT WE REALLY MUST
TAKE LEAVE.  THIS HAS BEEN A MOST AGREEABLE PIECE OF NEWS INDEED.
I SHALL JUST GO ROUND BY MRS. COLE'S; BUT I SHALL NOT STOP THREE MINUTES:
AND, JANE, YOU HAD BETTER GO HOME DIRECTLY--I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU
OUT IN A SHOWER!--WE THINK SHE IS THE BETTER FOR HIGHBURY ALREADY.
THANK YOU, WE DO INDEED.  I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT CALLING ON MRS. GODDARD,
FOR I REALLY DO NOT THINK SHE CARES FOR ANY THING BUT _BOILED_ PORK:
WHEN WE DRESS THE LEG IT WILL BE ANOTHER THING.  GOOD MORNING TO YOU,
MY DEAR SIR.  OH!  MR. KNIGHTLEY IS COMING TOO.  WELL, THAT IS
SO VERY!--I AM SURE IF JANE IS TIRED, YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO
GIVE HER YOUR ARM.--MR. ELTON, AND MISS HAWKINS!--GOOD MORNING
TO YOU."

EMMA, ALONE WITH HER FATHER, HAD HALF HER ATTENTION WANTED BY HIM
WHILE HE LAMENTED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO MARRY--
AND TO MARRY STRANGERS TOO--AND THE OTHER HALF SHE COULD GIVE
TO HER OWN VIEW OF THE SUBJECT.  IT WAS TO HERSELF AN AMUSING
AND A VERY WELCOME PIECE OF NEWS, AS PROVING THAT MR. ELTON
COULD NOT HAVE SUFFERED LONG; BUT SHE WAS SORRY FOR HARRIET:
HARRIET MUST FEEL IT--AND ALL THAT SHE COULD HOPE WAS, BY GIVING
THE FIRST INFORMATION HERSELF, TO SAVE HER FROM HEARING IT ABRUPTLY
FROM OTHERS.  IT WAS NOW ABOUT THE TIME THAT SHE WAS LIKELY TO CALL.
IF SHE WERE TO MEET MISS BATES IN HER WAY!--AND UPON ITS BEGINNING
TO RAIN, EMMA WAS OBLIGED TO EXPECT THAT THE WEATHER WOULD BE
DETAINING HER AT MRS. GODDARD'S, AND THAT THE INTELLIGENCE WOULD
UNDOUBTEDLY RUSH UPON HER WITHOUT PREPARATION.

THE SHOWER WAS HEAVY, BUT SHORT; AND IT HAD NOT BEEN OVER FIVE MINUTES,
WHEN IN CAME HARRIET, WITH JUST THE HEATED, AGITATED LOOK WHICH
HURRYING THITHER WITH A FULL HEART WAS LIKELY TO GIVE; AND THE
"OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED!" WHICH INSTANTLY
BURST FORTH, HAD ALL THE EVIDENCE OF CORRESPONDING PERTURBATION.
AS THE BLOW WAS GIVEN, EMMA FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT NOW SHEW GREATER
KINDNESS THAN IN LISTENING; AND HARRIET, UNCHECKED, RAN EAGERLY
THROUGH WHAT SHE HAD TO TELL.  "SHE HAD SET OUT FROM MRS. GODDARD'S
HALF AN HOUR AGO--SHE HAD BEEN AFRAID IT WOULD RAIN--SHE HAD BEEN
AFRAID IT WOULD POUR DOWN EVERY MOMENT--BUT SHE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT
GET TO HARTFIELD FIRST--SHE HAD HURRIED ON AS FAST AS POSSIBLE;
BUT THEN, AS SHE WAS PASSING BY THE HOUSE WHERE A YOUNG WOMAN
WAS MAKING UP A GOWN FOR HER, SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD JUST STEP
IN AND SEE HOW IT WENT ON; AND THOUGH SHE DID NOT SEEM TO STAY
HALF A MOMENT THERE, SOON AFTER SHE CAME OUT IT BEGAN TO RAIN,
AND SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO; SO SHE RAN ON DIRECTLY, AS FAST
AS SHE COULD, AND TOOK SHELTER AT FORD'S."--FORD'S WAS THE PRINCIPAL
WOOLLEN-DRAPER, LINEN-DRAPER, AND HABERDASHER'S SHOP UNITED;
THE SHOP FIRST IN SIZE AND FASHION IN THE PLACE.--"AND SO,
THERE SHE HAD SET, WITHOUT AN IDEA OF ANY THING IN THE WORLD,
FULL TEN MINUTES, PERHAPS--WHEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHO SHOULD COME IN--
TO BE SURE IT WAS SO VERY ODD!--BUT THEY ALWAYS DEALT AT FORD'S--
WHO SHOULD COME IN, BUT ELIZABETH MARTIN AND HER BROTHER!--
DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE! ONLY THINK.  I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE FAINTED.
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO.  I WAS SITTING NEAR THE DOOR--ELIZABETH SAW
ME DIRECTLY; BUT HE DID NOT; HE WAS BUSY WITH THE UMBRELLA.
I AM SURE SHE SAW ME, BUT SHE LOOKED AWAY DIRECTLY, AND TOOK
NO NOTICE; AND THEY BOTH WENT TO QUITE THE FARTHER END OF THE SHOP;
AND I KEPT SITTING NEAR THE DOOR!--OH! DEAR; I WAS SO MISERABLE!
I AM SURE I MUST HAVE BEEN AS WHITE AS MY GOWN.  I COULD NOT GO AWAY
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF THE RAIN; BUT I DID SO WISH MYSELF ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD BUT THERE.--OH! DEAR, MISS WOODHOUSE--WELL, AT LAST,
I FANCY, HE LOOKED ROUND AND SAW ME; FOR INSTEAD OF GOING
ON WITH HER BUYINGS, THEY BEGAN WHISPERING TO ONE ANOTHER.
I AM SURE THEY WERE TALKING OF ME; AND I COULD NOT HELP THINKING
THAT HE WAS PERSUADING HER TO SPEAK TO ME--(DO YOU THINK HE WAS,
MISS WOODHOUSE?)--FOR PRESENTLY SHE CAME FORWARD--CAME QUITE UP
TO ME, AND ASKED ME HOW I DID, AND SEEMED READY TO SHAKE HANDS,
IF I WOULD.  SHE DID NOT DO ANY OF IT IN THE SAME WAY THAT SHE USED;
I COULD SEE SHE WAS ALTERED; BUT, HOWEVER, SHE SEEMED TO _TRY_ TO BE
VERY FRIENDLY, AND WE SHOOK HANDS, AND STOOD TALKING SOME TIME;
BUT I KNOW NO MORE WHAT I SAID--I WAS IN SUCH A TREMBLE!--I REMEMBER
SHE SAID SHE WAS SORRY WE NEVER MET NOW; WHICH I THOUGHT ALMOST
TOO KIND!  DEAR, MISS WOODHOUSE, I WAS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE!
BY THAT TIME, IT WAS BEGINNING TO HOLD UP, AND I WAS DETERMINED
THAT NOTHING SHOULD STOP ME FROM GETTING AWAY--AND THEN--ONLY THINK!--
I FOUND HE WAS COMING UP TOWARDS ME TOO--SLOWLY YOU KNOW, AND AS
IF HE DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO; AND SO HE CAME AND SPOKE,
AND I ANSWERED--AND I STOOD FOR A MINUTE, FEELING DREADFULLY,
YOU KNOW, ONE CAN'T TELL HOW; AND THEN I TOOK COURAGE, AND SAID IT
DID NOT RAIN, AND I MUST GO; AND SO OFF I SET; AND I HAD NOT GOT
THREE YARDS FROM THE DOOR, WHEN HE CAME AFTER ME, ONLY TO SAY,
IF I WAS GOING TO HARTFIELD, HE THOUGHT I HAD MUCH BETTER GO ROUND
BY MR. COLE'S STABLES, FOR I SHOULD FIND THE NEAR WAY QUITE FLOATED
BY THIS RAIN.  OH! DEAR, I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF ME!
SO I SAID, I WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM:  YOU KNOW I COULD
NOT DO LESS; AND THEN HE WENT BACK TO ELIZABETH, AND I CAME ROUND
BY THE STABLES--I BELIEVE I DID--BUT I HARDLY KNEW WHERE I WAS,
OR ANY THING ABOUT IT.  OH!  MISS WOODHOUSE, I WOULD RATHER DONE
ANY THING THAN HAVE IT HAPPEN:  AND YET, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A SORT
OF SATISFACTION IN SEEING HIM BEHAVE SO PLEASANTLY AND SO KINDLY.
AND ELIZABETH, TOO.  OH!  MISS WOODHOUSE, DO TALK TO ME AND MAKE
ME COMFORTABLE AGAIN."

VERY SINCERELY DID EMMA WISH TO DO SO; BUT IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY IN
HER POWER.  SHE WAS OBLIGED TO STOP AND THINK.  SHE WAS NOT THOROUGHLY
COMFORTABLE HERSELF.  THE YOUNG MAN'S CONDUCT, AND HIS SISTER'S,
SEEMED THE RESULT OF REAL FEELING, AND SHE COULD NOT BUT PITY THEM.
AS HARRIET DESCRIBED IT, THERE HAD BEEN AN INTERESTING MIXTURE
OF WOUNDED AFFECTION AND GENUINE DELICACY IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR.
BUT SHE HAD BELIEVED THEM TO BE WELL-MEANING, WORTHY PEOPLE BEFORE;
AND WHAT DIFFERENCE DID THIS MAKE IN THE EVILS OF THE CONNEXION?
IT WAS FOLLY TO BE DISTURBED BY IT.  OF COURSE, HE MUST BE SORRY
TO LOSE HER--THEY MUST BE ALL SORRY.  AMBITION, AS WELL AS LOVE,
HAD PROBABLY BEEN MORTIFIED.  THEY MIGHT ALL HAVE HOPED TO RISE
BY HARRIET'S ACQUAINTANCE:  AND BESIDES, WHAT WAS THE VALUE OF
HARRIET'S DESCRIPTION?--SO EASILY PLEASED--SO LITTLE DISCERNING;--
WHAT SIGNIFIED HER PRAISE?

SHE EXERTED HERSELF, AND DID TRY TO MAKE HER COMFORTABLE,
BY CONSIDERING ALL THAT HAD PASSED AS A MERE TRIFLE, AND QUITE
UNWORTHY OF BEING DWELT ON,

"IT MIGHT BE DISTRESSING, FOR THE MOMENT," SAID SHE; "BUT YOU SEEM
TO HAVE BEHAVED EXTREMELY WELL; AND IT IS OVER--AND MAY NEVER--
CAN NEVER, AS A FIRST MEETING, OCCUR AGAIN, AND THEREFORE YOU NEED
NOT THINK ABOUT IT."

HARRIET SAID, "VERY TRUE," AND SHE "WOULD NOT THINK ABOUT IT;"
BUT STILL SHE TALKED OF IT--STILL SHE COULD TALK OF NOTHING ELSE;
AND EMMA, AT LAST, IN ORDER TO PUT THE MARTINS OUT OF HER HEAD,
WAS OBLIGED TO HURRY ON THE NEWS, WHICH SHE HAD MEANT TO GIVE
WITH SO MUCH TENDER CAUTION; HARDLY KNOWING HERSELF WHETHER
TO REJOICE OR BE ANGRY, ASHAMED OR ONLY AMUSED, AT SUCH A STATE
OF MIND IN POOR HARRIET--SUCH A CONCLUSION OF MR. ELTON'S IMPORTANCE
WITH HER!

MR. ELTON'S RIGHTS, HOWEVER, GRADUALLY REVIVED.  THOUGH SHE DID NOT
FEEL THE FIRST INTELLIGENCE AS SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE THE DAY BEFORE,
OR AN HOUR BEFORE, ITS INTEREST SOON INCREASED; AND BEFORE THEIR
FIRST CONVERSATION WAS OVER, SHE HAD TALKED HERSELF INTO ALL THE
SENSATIONS OF CURIOSITY, WONDER AND REGRET, PAIN AND PLEASURE,
AS TO THIS FORTUNATE MISS HAWKINS, WHICH COULD CONDUCE TO PLACE
THE MARTINS UNDER PROPER SUBORDINATION IN HER FANCY.

EMMA LEARNED TO BE RATHER GLAD THAT THERE HAD BEEN SUCH A MEETING.
IT HAD BEEN SERVICEABLE IN DEADENING THE FIRST SHOCK, WITHOUT RETAINING
ANY INFLUENCE TO ALARM.  AS HARRIET NOW LIVED, THE MARTINS COULD
NOT GET AT HER, WITHOUT SEEKING HER, WHERE HITHERTO THEY HAD WANTED
EITHER THE COURAGE OR THE CONDESCENSION TO SEEK HER; FOR SINCE HER
REFUSAL OF THE BROTHER, THE SISTERS NEVER HAD BEEN AT MRS. GODDARD'S;
AND A TWELVEMONTH MIGHT PASS WITHOUT THEIR BEING THROWN TOGETHER AGAIN,
WITH ANY NECESSITY, OR EVEN ANY POWER OF SPEECH.



CHAPTER IV


HUMAN NATURE IS SO WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS THOSE WHO ARE IN
INTERESTING SITUATIONS, THAT A YOUNG PERSON, WHO EITHER MARRIES
OR DIES, IS SURE OF BEING KINDLY SPOKEN OF.

A WEEK HAD NOT PASSED SINCE MISS HAWKINS'S NAME WAS FIRST
MENTIONED IN HIGHBURY, BEFORE SHE WAS, BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER,
DISCOVERED TO HAVE EVERY RECOMMENDATION OF PERSON AND MIND;
TO BE HANDSOME, ELEGANT, HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED, AND PERFECTLY AMIABLE:
AND WHEN MR. ELTON HIMSELF ARRIVED TO TRIUMPH IN HIS HAPPY PROSPECTS,
AND CIRCULATE THE FAME OF HER MERITS, THERE WAS VERY LITTLE MORE
FOR HIM TO DO, THAN TO TELL HER CHRISTIAN NAME, AND SAY WHOSE
MUSIC SHE PRINCIPALLY PLAYED.

MR. ELTON RETURNED, A VERY HAPPY MAN.  HE HAD GONE AWAY REJECTED
AND MORTIFIED--DISAPPOINTED IN A VERY SANGUINE HOPE, AFTER A SERIES
OF WHAT APPEARED TO HIM STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT; AND NOT ONLY LOSING
THE RIGHT LADY, BUT FINDING HIMSELF DEBASED TO THE LEVEL OF A VERY
WRONG ONE.  HE HAD GONE AWAY DEEPLY OFFENDED--HE CAME BACK ENGAGED
TO ANOTHER--AND TO ANOTHER AS SUPERIOR, OF COURSE, TO THE FIRST,
AS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT IS GAINED ALWAYS IS TO WHAT IS LOST.
HE CAME BACK GAY AND SELF-SATISFIED, EAGER AND BUSY, CARING NOTHING
FOR MISS WOODHOUSE, AND DEFYING MISS SMITH.

THE CHARMING AUGUSTA HAWKINS, IN ADDITION TO ALL THE USUAL ADVANTAGES
OF PERFECT BEAUTY AND MERIT, WAS IN POSSESSION OF AN INDEPENDENT FORTUNE,
OF SO MANY THOUSANDS AS WOULD ALWAYS BE CALLED TEN; A POINT OF
SOME DIGNITY, AS WELL AS SOME CONVENIENCE:  THE STORY TOLD WELL;
HE HAD NOT THROWN HIMSELF AWAY--HE HAD GAINED A WOMAN OF 10,000 L.
OR THEREABOUTS; AND HE HAD GAINED HER WITH SUCH DELIGHTFUL RAPIDITY--
THE FIRST HOUR OF INTRODUCTION HAD BEEN SO VERY SOON FOLLOWED BY
DISTINGUISHING NOTICE; THE HISTORY WHICH HE HAD TO GIVE MRS. COLE
OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE AFFAIR WAS SO GLORIOUS--THE STEPS
SO QUICK, FROM THE ACCIDENTAL RENCONTRE, TO THE DINNER AT MR. GREEN'S,
AND THE PARTY AT MRS. BROWN'S--SMILES AND BLUSHES RISING IN IMPORTANCE--
WITH CONSCIOUSNESS AND AGITATION RICHLY SCATTERED--THE LADY
HAD BEEN SO EASILY IMPRESSED--SO SWEETLY DISPOSED--HAD IN SHORT,
TO USE A MOST INTELLIGIBLE PHRASE, BEEN SO VERY READY TO HAVE HIM,
THAT VANITY AND PRUDENCE WERE EQUALLY CONTENTED.

HE HAD CAUGHT BOTH SUBSTANCE AND SHADOW--BOTH FORTUNE AND AFFECTION,
AND WAS JUST THE HAPPY MAN HE OUGHT TO BE; TALKING ONLY OF HIMSELF
AND HIS OWN CONCERNS--EXPECTING TO BE CONGRATULATED--READY TO BE
LAUGHED AT--AND, WITH CORDIAL, FEARLESS SMILES, NOW ADDRESSING
ALL THE YOUNG LADIES OF THE PLACE, TO WHOM, A FEW WEEKS AGO,
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAUTIOUSLY GALLANT.

THE WEDDING WAS NO DISTANT EVENT, AS THE PARTIES HAD ONLY THEMSELVES
TO PLEASE, AND NOTHING BUT THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS TO WAIT FOR;
AND WHEN HE SET OUT FOR BATH AGAIN, THERE WAS A GENERAL EXPECTATION,
WHICH A CERTAIN GLANCE OF MRS. COLE'S DID NOT SEEM TO CONTRADICT,
THAT WHEN HE NEXT ENTERED HIGHBURY HE WOULD BRING HIS BRIDE.

DURING HIS PRESENT SHORT STAY, EMMA HAD BARELY SEEN HIM; BUT JUST
ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT THE FIRST MEETING WAS OVER, AND TO GIVE HER
THE IMPRESSION OF HIS NOT BEING IMPROVED BY THE MIXTURE OF PIQUE
AND PRETENSION, NOW SPREAD OVER HIS AIR.  SHE WAS, IN FACT,
BEGINNING VERY MUCH TO WONDER THAT SHE HAD EVER THOUGHT HIM PLEASING
AT ALL; AND HIS SIGHT WAS SO INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH SOME VERY
DISAGREEABLE FEELINGS, THAT, EXCEPT IN A MORAL LIGHT, AS A PENANCE,
A LESSON, A SOURCE OF PROFITABLE HUMILIATION TO HER OWN MIND,
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THANKFUL TO BE ASSURED OF NEVER SEEING HIM AGAIN.
SHE WISHED HIM VERY WELL; BUT HE GAVE HER PAIN, AND HIS WELFARE
TWENTY MILES OFF WOULD ADMINISTER MOST SATISFACTION.

THE PAIN OF HIS CONTINUED RESIDENCE IN HIGHBURY, HOWEVER, MUST CERTAINLY
BE LESSENED BY HIS MARRIAGE.  MANY VAIN SOLICITUDES WOULD BE PREVENTED--
MANY AWKWARDNESSES SMOOTHED BY IT.  A _MRS._ _ELTON_ WOULD BE AN EXCUSE FOR
ANY CHANGE OF INTERCOURSE; FORMER INTIMACY MIGHT SINK WITHOUT REMARK.
IT WOULD BE ALMOST BEGINNING THEIR LIFE OF CIVILITY AGAIN.

OF THE LADY, INDIVIDUALLY, EMMA THOUGHT VERY LITTLE.  SHE WAS GOOD
ENOUGH FOR MR. ELTON, NO DOUBT; ACCOMPLISHED ENOUGH FOR HIGHBURY--
HANDSOME ENOUGH--TO LOOK PLAIN, PROBABLY, BY HARRIET'S SIDE.
AS TO CONNEXION, THERE EMMA WAS PERFECTLY EASY; PERSUADED,
THAT AFTER ALL HIS OWN VAUNTED CLAIMS AND DISDAIN OF HARRIET,
HE HAD DONE NOTHING.  ON THAT ARTICLE, TRUTH SEEMED ATTAINABLE.
_WHAT_ SHE WAS, MUST BE UNCERTAIN; BUT _WHO_ SHE WAS, MIGHT BE FOUND OUT;
AND SETTING ASIDE THE 10,000 L., IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT SHE WAS AT
ALL HARRIET'S SUPERIOR.  SHE BROUGHT NO NAME, NO BLOOD, NO ALLIANCE.
MISS HAWKINS WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF A BRISTOL--
MERCHANT, OF COURSE, HE MUST BE CALLED; BUT, AS THE WHOLE OF THE
PROFITS OF HIS MERCANTILE LIFE APPEARED SO VERY MODERATE, IT WAS
NOT UNFAIR TO GUESS THE DIGNITY OF HIS LINE OF TRADE HAD BEEN VERY
MODERATE ALSO.  PART OF EVERY WINTER SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SPEND IN BATH;
BUT BRISTOL WAS HER HOME, THE VERY HEART OF BRISTOL; FOR THOUGH
THE FATHER AND MOTHER HAD DIED SOME YEARS AGO, AN UNCLE REMAINED--
IN THE LAW LINE--NOTHING MORE DISTINCTLY HONOURABLE WAS HAZARDED
OF HIM, THAN THAT HE WAS IN THE LAW LINE; AND WITH HIM THE DAUGHTER
HAD LIVED.  EMMA GUESSED HIM TO BE THE DRUDGE OF SOME ATTORNEY,
AND TOO STUPID TO RISE.  AND ALL THE GRANDEUR OF THE CONNEXION
SEEMED DEPENDENT ON THE ELDER SISTER, WHO WAS _VERY_ _WELL_ _MARRIED_,
TO A GENTLEMAN IN A _GREAT_ _WAY_, NEAR BRISTOL, WHO KEPT TWO CARRIAGES!
THAT WAS THE WIND-UP OF THE HISTORY; THAT WAS THE GLORY OF
MISS HAWKINS.

COULD SHE BUT HAVE GIVEN HARRIET HER FEELINGS ABOUT IT ALL!
SHE HAD TALKED HER INTO LOVE; BUT, ALAS! SHE WAS NOT SO EASILY TO BE
TALKED OUT OF IT.  THE CHARM OF AN OBJECT TO OCCUPY THE MANY VACANCIES
OF HARRIET'S MIND WAS NOT TO BE TALKED AWAY.  HE MIGHT BE SUPERSEDED
BY ANOTHER; HE CERTAINLY WOULD INDEED; NOTHING COULD BE CLEARER;
EVEN A ROBERT MARTIN WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT; BUT NOTHING ELSE,
SHE FEARED, WOULD CURE HER.  HARRIET WAS ONE OF THOSE, WHO,
HAVING ONCE BEGUN, WOULD BE ALWAYS IN LOVE.  AND NOW, POOR GIRL!
SHE WAS CONSIDERABLY WORSE FROM THIS REAPPEARANCE OF MR. ELTON.
SHE WAS ALWAYS HAVING A GLIMPSE OF HIM SOMEWHERE OR OTHER.  EMMA SAW
HIM ONLY ONCE; BUT TWO OR THREE TIMES EVERY DAY HARRIET WAS SURE
_JUST_ TO MEET WITH HIM, OR _JUST_ TO MISS HIM, _JUST_ TO HEAR HIS VOICE,
OR SEE HIS SHOULDER, _JUST_ TO HAVE SOMETHING OCCUR TO PRESERVE HIM
IN HER FANCY, IN ALL THE FAVOURING WARMTH OF SURPRIZE AND CONJECTURE.
SHE WAS, MOREOVER, PERPETUALLY HEARING ABOUT HIM; FOR, EXCEPTING WHEN
AT HARTFIELD, SHE WAS ALWAYS AMONG THOSE WHO SAW NO FAULT IN MR. ELTON,
AND FOUND NOTHING SO INTERESTING AS THE DISCUSSION OF HIS CONCERNS;
AND EVERY REPORT, THEREFORE, EVERY GUESS--ALL THAT HAD ALREADY
OCCURRED, ALL THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF HIS AFFAIRS,
COMPREHENDING INCOME, SERVANTS, AND FURNITURE, WAS CONTINUALLY
IN AGITATION AROUND HER.  HER REGARD WAS RECEIVING STRENGTH BY
INVARIABLE PRAISE OF HIM, AND HER REGRETS KEPT ALIVE, AND FEELINGS
IRRITATED BY CEASELESS REPETITIONS OF MISS HAWKINS'S HAPPINESS,
AND CONTINUAL OBSERVATION OF, HOW MUCH HE SEEMED ATTACHED!--
HIS AIR AS HE WALKED BY THE HOUSE--THE VERY SITTING OF HIS HAT,
BEING ALL IN PROOF OF HOW MUCH HE WAS IN LOVE!

HAD IT BEEN ALLOWABLE ENTERTAINMENT, HAD THERE BEEN NO PAIN
TO HER FRIEND, OR REPROACH TO HERSELF, IN THE WAVERINGS OF
HARRIET'S MIND, EMMA WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED BY ITS VARIATIONS.
SOMETIMES MR. ELTON PREDOMINATED, SOMETIMES THE MARTINS; AND EACH
WAS OCCASIONALLY USEFUL AS A CHECK TO THE OTHER.  MR. ELTON'S
ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN THE CURE OF THE AGITATION OF MEETING MR. MARTIN.
THE UNHAPPINESS PRODUCED BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN
A LITTLE PUT ASIDE BY ELIZABETH MARTIN'S CALLING AT MRS. GODDARD'S
A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS.  HARRIET HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME; BUT A NOTE HAD
BEEN PREPARED AND LEFT FOR HER, WRITTEN IN THE VERY STYLE TO TOUCH;
A SMALL MIXTURE OF REPROACH, WITH A GREAT DEAL OF KINDNESS;
AND TILL MR. ELTON HIMSELF APPEARED, SHE HAD BEEN MUCH OCCUPIED
BY IT, CONTINUALLY PONDERING OVER WHAT COULD BE DONE IN RETURN,
AND WISHING TO DO MORE THAN SHE DARED TO CONFESS.  BUT MR. ELTON,
IN PERSON, HAD DRIVEN AWAY ALL SUCH CARES.  WHILE HE STAID,
THE MARTINS WERE FORGOTTEN; AND ON THE VERY MORNING OF HIS SETTING OFF
FOR BATH AGAIN, EMMA, TO DISSIPATE SOME OF THE DISTRESS IT OCCASIONED,
JUDGED IT BEST FOR HER TO RETURN ELIZABETH MARTIN'S VISIT.

HOW THAT VISIT WAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED--WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY--
AND WHAT MIGHT BE SAFEST, HAD BEEN A POINT OF SOME DOUBTFUL
CONSIDERATION.  ABSOLUTE NEGLECT OF THE MOTHER AND SISTERS,
WHEN INVITED TO COME, WOULD BE INGRATITUDE.  IT MUST NOT BE:
AND YET THE DANGER OF A RENEWAL OF THE ACQUAINTANCE!--

AFTER MUCH THINKING, SHE COULD DETERMINE ON NOTHING BETTER, THAN HARRIET'S
RETURNING THE VISIT; BUT IN A WAY THAT, IF THEY HAD UNDERSTANDING,
SHOULD CONVINCE THEM THAT IT WAS TO BE ONLY A FORMAL ACQUAINTANCE.
SHE MEANT TO TAKE HER IN THE CARRIAGE, LEAVE HER AT THE ABBEY MILL,
WHILE SHE DROVE A LITTLE FARTHER, AND CALL FOR HER AGAIN SO SOON,
AS TO ALLOW NO TIME FOR INSIDIOUS APPLICATIONS OR DANGEROUS
RECURRENCES TO THE PAST, AND GIVE THE MOST DECIDED PROOF OF WHAT
DEGREE OF INTIMACY WAS CHOSEN FOR THE FUTURE.

SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BETTER:  AND THOUGH THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN IT WHICH HER OWN HEART COULD NOT APPROVE--SOMETHING OF INGRATITUDE,
MERELY GLOSSED OVER--IT MUST BE DONE, OR WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HARRIET?



CHAPTER V


SMALL HEART HAD HARRIET FOR VISITING.  ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HER
FRIEND CALLED FOR HER AT MRS. GODDARD'S, HER EVIL STARS HAD LED
HER TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE, AT THAT MOMENT, A TRUNK, DIRECTED TO
_THE_ _REV._ _PHILIP_ _ELTON_, _WHITE-HART_, _BATH_, WAS TO BE SEEN UNDER THE
OPERATION OF BEING LIFTED INTO THE BUTCHER'S CART, WHICH WAS TO
CONVEY IT TO WHERE THE COACHES PAST; AND EVERY THING IN THIS WORLD,
EXCEPTING THAT TRUNK AND THE DIRECTION, WAS CONSEQUENTLY A BLANK.

SHE WENT, HOWEVER; AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE FARM, AND SHE WAS TO
BE PUT DOWN, AT THE END OF THE BROAD, NEAT GRAVEL WALK, WHICH LED
BETWEEN ESPALIER APPLE-TREES TO THE FRONT DOOR, THE SIGHT OF EVERY
THING WHICH HAD GIVEN HER SO MUCH PLEASURE THE AUTUMN BEFORE,
WAS BEGINNING TO REVIVE A LITTLE LOCAL AGITATION; AND WHEN THEY PARTED,
EMMA OBSERVED HER TO BE LOOKING AROUND WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL CURIOSITY,
WHICH DETERMINED HER NOT TO ALLOW THE VISIT TO EXCEED THE PROPOSED
QUARTER OF AN HOUR.  SHE WENT ON HERSELF, TO GIVE THAT PORTION
OF TIME TO AN OLD SERVANT WHO WAS MARRIED, AND SETTLED IN DONWELL.

THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR BROUGHT HER PUNCTUALLY TO THE WHITE GATE AGAIN;
AND MISS SMITH RECEIVING HER SUMMONS, WAS WITH HER WITHOUT DELAY,
AND UNATTENDED BY ANY ALARMING YOUNG MAN.  SHE CAME SOLITARILY
DOWN THE GRAVEL WALK--A MISS MARTIN JUST APPEARING AT THE DOOR,
AND PARTING WITH HER SEEMINGLY WITH CEREMONIOUS CIVILITY.

HARRIET COULD NOT VERY SOON GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ACCOUNT.
SHE WAS FEELING TOO MUCH; BUT AT LAST EMMA COLLECTED FROM HER
ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE SORT OF MEETING, AND THE SORT OF PAIN IT
WAS CREATING.  SHE HAD SEEN ONLY MRS. MARTIN AND THE TWO GIRLS.
THEY HAD RECEIVED HER DOUBTINGLY, IF NOT COOLLY; AND NOTHING
BEYOND THE MEREST COMMONPLACE HAD BEEN TALKED ALMOST ALL THE TIME--
TILL JUST AT LAST, WHEN MRS. MARTIN'S SAYING, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THAT SHE THOUGHT MISS SMITH WAS GROWN, HAD BROUGHT ON A MORE
INTERESTING SUBJECT, AND A WARMER MANNER.  IN THAT VERY ROOM
SHE HAD BEEN MEASURED LAST SEPTEMBER, WITH HER TWO FRIENDS.
THERE WERE THE PENCILLED MARKS AND MEMORANDUMS ON THE WAINSCOT BY
THE WINDOW.  _HE_ HAD DONE IT.  THEY ALL SEEMED TO REMEMBER THE DAY,
THE HOUR, THE PARTY, THE OCCASION--TO FEEL THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS,
THE SAME REGRETS--TO BE READY TO RETURN TO THE SAME GOOD UNDERSTANDING;
AND THEY WERE JUST GROWING AGAIN LIKE THEMSELVES, (HARRIET, AS EMMA
MUST SUSPECT, AS READY AS THE BEST OF THEM TO BE CORDIAL AND HAPPY,)
WHEN THE CARRIAGE REAPPEARED, AND ALL WAS OVER.  THE STYLE OF
THE VISIT, AND THE SHORTNESS OF IT, WERE THEN FELT TO BE DECISIVE.
FOURTEEN MINUTES TO BE GIVEN TO THOSE WITH WHOM SHE HAD THANKFULLY
PASSED SIX WEEKS NOT SIX MONTHS AGO!--EMMA COULD NOT BUT PICTURE
IT ALL, AND FEEL HOW JUSTLY THEY MIGHT RESENT, HOW NATURALLY
HARRIET MUST SUFFER.  IT WAS A BAD BUSINESS.  SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN
A GREAT DEAL, OR ENDURED A GREAT DEAL, TO HAVE HAD THE MARTINS
IN A HIGHER RANK OF LIFE.  THEY WERE SO DESERVING, THAT A _LITTLE_
HIGHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH:  BUT AS IT WAS, HOW COULD SHE HAVE
DONE OTHERWISE?--IMPOSSIBLE!--SHE COULD NOT REPENT.  THEY MUST
BE SEPARATED; BUT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN IN THE PROCESS--
SO MUCH TO HERSELF AT THIS TIME, THAT SHE SOON FELT THE NECESSITY
OF A LITTLE CONSOLATION, AND RESOLVED ON GOING HOME BY WAY OF RANDALLS
TO PROCURE IT.  HER MIND WAS QUITE SICK OF MR. ELTON AND THE MARTINS.
THE REFRESHMENT OF RANDALLS WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

IT WAS A GOOD SCHEME; BUT ON DRIVING TO THE DOOR THEY HEARD
THAT NEITHER "MASTER NOR MISTRESS WAS AT HOME;" THEY HAD BOTH
BEEN OUT SOME TIME; THE MAN BELIEVED THEY WERE GONE TO HARTFIELD.

"THIS IS TOO BAD," CRIED EMMA, AS THEY TURNED AWAY.  "AND NOW WE
SHALL JUST MISS THEM; TOO PROVOKING!--I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I HAVE BEEN
SO DISAPPOINTED."  AND SHE LEANED BACK IN THE CORNER, TO INDULGE
HER MURMURS, OR TO REASON THEM AWAY; PROBABLY A LITTLE OF BOTH--
SUCH BEING THE COMMONEST PROCESS OF A NOT ILL-DISPOSED MIND.
PRESENTLY THE CARRIAGE STOPT; SHE LOOKED UP; IT WAS STOPT
BY MR. AND MRS. WESTON, WHO WERE STANDING TO SPEAK TO HER.
THERE WAS INSTANT PLEASURE IN THE SIGHT OF THEM, AND STILL GREATER
PLEASURE WAS CONVEYED IN SOUND--FOR MR. WESTON IMMEDIATELY ACCOSTED
HER WITH,

"HOW D'YE DO?--HOW D'YE DO?--WE HAVE BEEN SITTING WITH YOUR FATHER--
GLAD TO SEE HIM SO WELL.  FRANK COMES TO-MORROW--I HAD A LETTER
THIS MORNING--WE SEE HIM TO-MORROW BY DINNER-TIME TO A CERTAINTY--
HE IS AT OXFORD TO-DAY, AND HE COMES FOR A WHOLE FORTNIGHT; I KNEW IT WOULD
BE SO.  IF HE HAD COME AT CHRISTMAS HE COULD NOT HAVE STAID THREE DAYS;
I WAS ALWAYS GLAD HE DID NOT COME AT CHRISTMAS; NOW WE ARE GOING
TO HAVE JUST THE RIGHT WEATHER FOR HIM, FINE, DRY, SETTLED WEATHER.
WE SHALL ENJOY HIM COMPLETELY; EVERY THING HAS TURNED OUT EXACTLY
AS WE COULD WISH."

THERE WAS NO RESISTING SUCH NEWS, NO POSSIBILITY OF AVOIDING THE
INFLUENCE OF SUCH A HAPPY FACE AS MR. WESTON'S, CONFIRMED AS IT ALL
WAS BY THE WORDS AND THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS WIFE, FEWER AND QUIETER,
BUT NOT LESS TO THE PURPOSE.  TO KNOW THAT _SHE_ THOUGHT HIS COMING
CERTAIN WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE EMMA CONSIDER IT SO, AND SINCERELY DID
SHE REJOICE IN THEIR JOY.  IT WAS A MOST DELIGHTFUL REANIMATION
OF EXHAUSTED SPIRITS.  THE WORN-OUT PAST WAS SUNK IN THE FRESHNESS
OF WHAT WAS COMING; AND IN THE RAPIDITY OF HALF A MOMENT'S THOUGHT,
SHE HOPED MR. ELTON WOULD NOW BE TALKED OF NO MORE.

MR. WESTON GAVE HER THE HISTORY OF THE ENGAGEMENTS AT ENSCOMBE,
WHICH ALLOWED HIS SON TO ANSWER FOR HAVING AN ENTIRE FORTNIGHT AT
HIS COMMAND, AS WELL AS THE ROUTE AND THE METHOD OF HIS JOURNEY;
AND SHE LISTENED, AND SMILED, AND CONGRATULATED.

"I SHALL SOON BRING HIM OVER TO HARTFIELD," SAID HE, AT THE CONCLUSION.

EMMA COULD IMAGINE SHE SAW A TOUCH OF THE ARM AT THIS SPEECH,
FROM HIS WIFE.

"WE HAD BETTER MOVE ON, MR. WESTON," SAID SHE, "WE ARE DETAINING
THE GIRLS."

"WELL, WELL, I AM READY;"--AND TURNING AGAIN TO EMMA, "BUT YOU MUST
NOT BE EXPECTING SUCH A _VERY_ FINE YOUNG MAN; YOU HAVE ONLY HAD _MY_
ACCOUNT YOU KNOW; I DARE SAY HE IS REALLY NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY:"--
THOUGH HIS OWN SPARKLING EYES AT THE MOMENT WERE SPEAKING A VERY
DIFFERENT CONVICTION.

EMMA COULD LOOK PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS AND INNOCENT, AND ANSWER
IN A MANNER THAT APPROPRIATED NOTHING.

"THINK OF ME TO-MORROW, MY DEAR EMMA, ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK,"
WAS MRS. WESTON'S PARTING INJUNCTION; SPOKEN WITH SOME ANXIETY,
AND MEANT ONLY FOR HER.

"FOUR O'CLOCK!--DEPEND UPON IT HE WILL BE HERE BY THREE," WAS MR. WESTON'S
QUICK AMENDMENT; AND SO ENDED A MOST SATISFACTORY MEETING.
EMMA'S SPIRITS WERE MOUNTED QUITE UP TO HAPPINESS; EVERY THING WORE
A DIFFERENT AIR; JAMES AND HIS HORSES SEEMED NOT HALF SO SLUGGISH
AS BEFORE.  WHEN SHE LOOKED AT THE HEDGES, SHE THOUGHT THE ELDER AT
LEAST MUST SOON BE COMING OUT; AND WHEN SHE TURNED ROUND TO HARRIET,
SHE SAW SOMETHING LIKE A LOOK OF SPRING, A TENDER SMILE EVEN THERE.

"WILL MR. FRANK CHURCHILL PASS THROUGH BATH AS WELL AS OXFORD?"--
WAS A QUESTION, HOWEVER, WHICH DID NOT AUGUR MUCH.

BUT NEITHER GEOGRAPHY NOR TRANQUILLITY COULD COME ALL AT ONCE,
AND EMMA WAS NOW IN A HUMOUR TO RESOLVE THAT THEY SHOULD BOTH COME
IN TIME.

THE MORNING OF THE INTERESTING DAY ARRIVED, AND MRS. WESTON'S
FAITHFUL PUPIL DID NOT FORGET EITHER AT TEN, OR ELEVEN, OR TWELVE
O'CLOCK, THAT SHE WAS TO THINK OF HER AT FOUR.

"MY DEAR, DEAR ANXIOUS FRIEND,"--SAID SHE, IN MENTAL SOLILOQUY,
WHILE WALKING DOWNSTAIRS FROM HER OWN ROOM, "ALWAYS OVERCAREFUL
FOR EVERY BODY'S COMFORT BUT YOUR OWN; I SEE YOU NOW IN ALL YOUR
LITTLE FIDGETS, GOING AGAIN AND AGAIN INTO HIS ROOM, TO BE SURE
THAT ALL IS RIGHT."  THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AS SHE PASSED THROUGH
THE HALL.  "'TIS TWELVE; I SHALL NOT FORGET TO THINK OF YOU FOUR
HOURS HENCE; AND BY THIS TIME TO-MORROW, PERHAPS, OR A LITTLE LATER,
I MAY BE THINKING OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR ALL CALLING HERE.
I AM SURE THEY WILL BRING HIM SOON."

SHE OPENED THE PARLOUR DOOR, AND SAW TWO GENTLEMEN SITTING WITH
HER FATHER--MR. WESTON AND HIS SON.  THEY HAD BEEN ARRIVED ONLY
A FEW MINUTES, AND MR. WESTON HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HIS EXPLANATION
OF FRANK'S BEING A DAY BEFORE HIS TIME, AND HER FATHER WAS YET
IN THE MIDST OF HIS VERY CIVIL WELCOME AND CONGRATULATIONS, WHEN
SHE APPEARED, TO HAVE HER SHARE OF SURPRIZE, INTRODUCTION, AND PLEASURE.

THE FRANK CHURCHILL SO LONG TALKED OF, SO HIGH IN INTEREST,
WAS ACTUALLY BEFORE HER--HE WAS PRESENTED TO HER, AND SHE DID
NOT THINK TOO MUCH HAD BEEN SAID IN HIS PRAISE; HE WAS A _VERY_ GOOD
LOOKING YOUNG MAN; HEIGHT, AIR, ADDRESS, ALL WERE UNEXCEPTIONABLE,
AND HIS COUNTENANCE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF THE SPIRIT AND LIVELINESS
OF HIS FATHER'S; HE LOOKED QUICK AND SENSIBLE.  SHE FELT IMMEDIATELY
THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE HIM; AND THERE WAS A WELL-BRED EASE OF MANNER,
AND A READINESS TO TALK, WHICH CONVINCED HER THAT HE CAME INTENDING
TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HER, AND THAT ACQUAINTED THEY SOON MUST BE.

HE HAD REACHED RANDALLS THE EVENING BEFORE.  SHE WAS PLEASED
WITH THE EAGERNESS TO ARRIVE WHICH HAD MADE HIM ALTER HIS PLAN,
AND TRAVEL EARLIER, LATER, AND QUICKER, THAT HE MIGHT GAIN HALF
A DAY.

"I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY," CRIED MR. WESTON WITH EXULTATION, "I TOLD
YOU ALL THAT HE WOULD BE HERE BEFORE THE TIME NAMED.  I REMEMBERED
WHAT I USED TO DO MYSELF.  ONE CANNOT CREEP UPON A JOURNEY;
ONE CANNOT HELP GETTING ON FASTER THAN ONE HAS PLANNED; AND THE
PLEASURE OF COMING IN UPON ONE'S FRIENDS BEFORE THE LOOK-OUT BEGINS,
IS WORTH A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN ANY LITTLE EXERTION IT NEEDS."

"IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE WHERE ONE CAN INDULGE IN IT," SAID THE YOUNG MAN,
"THOUGH THERE ARE NOT MANY HOUSES THAT I SHOULD PRESUME ON SO FAR;
BUT IN COMING _HOME_ I FELT I MIGHT DO ANY THING."

THE WORD _HOME_ MADE HIS FATHER LOOK ON HIM WITH FRESH COMPLACENCY.
EMMA WAS DIRECTLY SURE THAT HE KNEW HOW TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE;
THE CONVICTION WAS STRENGTHENED BY WHAT FOLLOWED.  HE WAS VERY MUCH
PLEASED WITH RANDALLS, THOUGHT IT A MOST ADMIRABLY ARRANGED HOUSE,
WOULD HARDLY ALLOW IT EVEN TO BE VERY SMALL, ADMIRED THE SITUATION,
THE WALK TO HIGHBURY, HIGHBURY ITSELF, HARTFIELD STILL MORE,
AND PROFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALWAYS FELT THE SORT OF INTEREST
IN THE COUNTRY WHICH NONE BUT ONE'S _OWN_ COUNTRY GIVES, AND THE
GREATEST CURIOSITY TO VISIT IT.  THAT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO INDULGE SO AMIABLE A FEELING BEFORE, PASSED SUSPICIOUSLY
THROUGH EMMA'S BRAIN; BUT STILL, IF IT WERE A FALSEHOOD, IT WAS A
PLEASANT ONE, AND PLEASANTLY HANDLED.  HIS MANNER HAD NO AIR OF STUDY
OR EXAGGERATION.  HE DID REALLY LOOK AND SPEAK AS IF IN A STATE OF NO
COMMON ENJOYMENT.

THEIR SUBJECTS IN GENERAL WERE SUCH AS BELONG TO AN OPENING ACQUAINTANCE.
ON HIS SIDE WERE THE INQUIRIES,--"WAS SHE A HORSEWOMAN?--PLEASANT RIDES?--
PLEASANT WALKS?--HAD THEY A LARGE NEIGHBOURHOOD?--HIGHBURY, PERHAPS,
AFFORDED SOCIETY ENOUGH?--THERE WERE SEVERAL VERY PRETTY HOUSES
IN AND ABOUT IT.--BALLS--HAD THEY BALLS?--WAS IT A MUSICAL SOCIETY?"

BUT WHEN SATISFIED ON ALL THESE POINTS, AND THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
PROPORTIONABLY ADVANCED, HE CONTRIVED TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY,
WHILE THEIR TWO FATHERS WERE ENGAGED WITH EACH OTHER, OF INTRODUCING
HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW, AND SPEAKING OF HER WITH SO MUCH HANDSOME PRAISE,
SO MUCH WARM ADMIRATION, SO MUCH GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS SHE
SECURED TO HIS FATHER, AND HER VERY KIND RECEPTION OF HIMSELF,
AS WAS AN ADDITIONAL PROOF OF HIS KNOWING HOW TO PLEASE--
AND OF HIS CERTAINLY THINKING IT WORTH WHILE TO TRY TO PLEASE HER.
HE DID NOT ADVANCE A WORD OF PRAISE BEYOND WHAT SHE KNEW TO BE
THOROUGHLY DESERVED BY MRS. WESTON; BUT, UNDOUBTEDLY HE COULD KNOW
VERY LITTLE OF THE MATTER.  HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WOULD BE WELCOME;
HE COULD BE SURE OF LITTLE ELSE.  "HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE," HE SAID,
"HAD BEEN THE WISEST MEASURE, EVERY FRIEND MUST REJOICE IN IT;
AND THE FAMILY FROM WHOM HE HAD RECEIVED SUCH A BLESSING MUST
BE EVER CONSIDERED AS HAVING CONFERRED THE HIGHEST OBLIGATION
ON HIM."

HE GOT AS NEAR AS HE COULD TO THANKING HER FOR MISS TAYLOR'S MERITS,
WITHOUT SEEMING QUITE TO FORGET THAT IN THE COMMON COURSE OF THINGS IT
WAS TO BE RATHER SUPPOSED THAT MISS TAYLOR HAD FORMED MISS WOODHOUSE'S
CHARACTER, THAN MISS WOODHOUSE MISS TAYLOR'S. AND AT LAST, AS IF RESOLVED
TO QUALIFY HIS OPINION COMPLETELY FOR TRAVELLING ROUND TO ITS OBJECT, HE
WOUND IT ALL UP WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE YOUTH AND BEAUTY OF HER PERSON.

"ELEGANT, AGREEABLE MANNERS, I WAS PREPARED FOR," SAID HE;
"BUT I CONFESS THAT, CONSIDERING EVERY THING, I HAD NOT EXPECTED
MORE THAN A VERY TOLERABLY WELL-LOOKING WOMAN OF A CERTAIN AGE;
I DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS TO FIND A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN IN MRS. WESTON."

"YOU CANNOT SEE TOO MUCH PERFECTION IN MRS. WESTON FOR MY FEELINGS,"
SAID EMMA; "WERE YOU TO GUESS HER TO BE _EIGHTEEN_, I SHOULD LISTEN
WITH PLEASURE; BUT _SHE_ WOULD BE READY TO QUARREL WITH YOU FOR USING
SUCH WORDS.  DON'T LET HER IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF HER AS
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN."

"I HOPE I SHOULD KNOW BETTER," HE REPLIED; "NO, DEPEND UPON IT,
(WITH A GALLANT BOW,) THAT IN ADDRESSING MRS. WESTON I SHOULD
UNDERSTAND WHOM I MIGHT PRAISE WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF BEING THOUGHT
EXTRAVAGANT IN MY TERMS."

EMMA WONDERED WHETHER THE SAME SUSPICION OF WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED
FROM THEIR KNOWING EACH OTHER, WHICH HAD TAKEN STRONG POSSESSION
OF HER MIND, HAD EVER CROSSED HIS; AND WHETHER HIS COMPLIMENTS WERE
TO BE CONSIDERED AS MARKS OF ACQUIESCENCE, OR PROOFS OF DEFIANCE.
SHE MUST SEE MORE OF HIM TO UNDERSTAND HIS WAYS; AT PRESENT SHE
ONLY FELT THEY WERE AGREEABLE.

SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF WHAT MR. WESTON WAS OFTEN THINKING ABOUT.
HIS QUICK EYE SHE DETECTED AGAIN AND AGAIN GLANCING TOWARDS THEM
WITH A HAPPY EXPRESSION; AND EVEN, WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE DETERMINED NOT
TO LOOK, SHE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE WAS OFTEN LISTENING.

HER OWN FATHER'S PERFECT EXEMPTION FROM ANY THOUGHT OF THE KIND,
THE ENTIRE DEFICIENCY IN HIM OF ALL SUCH SORT OF PENETRATION
OR SUSPICION, WAS A MOST COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCE.  HAPPILY HE
WAS NOT FARTHER FROM APPROVING MATRIMONY THAN FROM FORESEEING IT.--
THOUGH ALWAYS OBJECTING TO EVERY MARRIAGE THAT WAS ARRANGED,
HE NEVER SUFFERED BEFOREHAND FROM THE APPREHENSION OF ANY;
IT SEEMED AS IF HE COULD NOT THINK SO ILL OF ANY TWO PERSONS'
UNDERSTANDING AS TO SUPPOSE THEY MEANT TO MARRY TILL IT WERE
PROVED AGAINST THEM.  SHE BLESSED THE FAVOURING BLINDNESS.
HE COULD NOW, WITHOUT THE DRAWBACK OF A SINGLE UNPLEASANT SURMISE,
WITHOUT A GLANCE FORWARD AT ANY POSSIBLE TREACHERY IN HIS GUEST,
GIVE WAY TO ALL HIS NATURAL KIND-HEARTED CIVILITY IN SOLICITOUS
INQUIRIES AFTER MR. FRANK CHURCHILL'S ACCOMMODATION ON HIS JOURNEY,
THROUGH THE SAD EVILS OF SLEEPING TWO NIGHTS ON THE ROAD, AND EXPRESS
VERY GENUINE UNMIXED ANXIETY TO KNOW THAT HE HAD CERTAINLY ESCAPED
CATCHING COLD--WHICH, HOWEVER, HE COULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO FEEL QUITE
ASSURED OF HIMSELF TILL AFTER ANOTHER NIGHT.

A REASONABLE VISIT PAID, MR. WESTON BEGAN TO MOVE.--"HE MUST BE GOING.
HE HAD BUSINESS AT THE CROWN ABOUT HIS HAY, AND A GREAT MANY ERRANDS
FOR MRS. WESTON AT FORD'S, BUT HE NEED NOT HURRY ANY BODY ELSE."
HIS SON, TOO WELL BRED TO HEAR THE HINT, ROSE IMMEDIATELY ALSO,
SAYING,

"AS YOU ARE GOING FARTHER ON BUSINESS, SIR, I WILL TAKE THE
OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING A VISIT, WHICH MUST BE PAID SOME DAY OR OTHER,
AND THEREFORE MAY AS WELL BE PAID NOW.  I HAVE THE HONOUR OF BEING
ACQUAINTED WITH A NEIGHBOUR OF YOURS, (TURNING TO EMMA,) A LADY
RESIDING IN OR NEAR HIGHBURY; A FAMILY OF THE NAME OF FAIRFAX.
I SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY, I SUPPOSE, IN FINDING THE HOUSE;
THOUGH FAIRFAX, I BELIEVE, IS NOT THE PROPER NAME--I SHOULD RATHER
SAY BARNES, OR BATES.  DO YOU KNOW ANY FAMILY OF THAT NAME?"

"TO BE SURE WE DO," CRIED HIS FATHER; "MRS. BATES--WE PASSED HER HOUSE--
I SAW MISS BATES AT THE WINDOW.  TRUE, TRUE, YOU ARE ACQUAINTED
WITH MISS FAIRFAX; I REMEMBER YOU KNEW HER AT WEYMOUTH, AND A FINE
GIRL SHE IS.  CALL UPON HER, BY ALL MEANS."

"THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR MY CALLING THIS MORNING," SAID THE
YOUNG MAN; "ANOTHER DAY WOULD DO AS WELL; BUT THERE WAS THAT DEGREE
OF ACQUAINTANCE AT WEYMOUTH WHICH--"

"OH! GO TO-DAY, GO TO-DAY. DO NOT DEFER IT.  WHAT IS RIGHT TO BE DONE
CANNOT BE DONE TOO SOON.  AND, BESIDES, I MUST GIVE YOU A HINT, FRANK;
ANY WANT OF ATTENTION TO HER _HERE_ SHOULD BE CAREFULLY AVOIDED.
YOU SAW HER WITH THE CAMPBELLS, WHEN SHE WAS THE EQUAL OF EVERY BODY
SHE MIXED WITH, BUT HERE SHE IS WITH A POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER,
WHO HAS BARELY ENOUGH TO LIVE ON.  IF YOU DO NOT CALL EARLY IT
WILL BE A SLIGHT."

THE SON LOOKED CONVINCED.

"I HAVE HEARD HER SPEAK OF THE ACQUAINTANCE," SAID EMMA; "SHE IS
A VERY ELEGANT YOUNG WOMAN."

HE AGREED TO IT, BUT WITH SO QUIET A "YES," AS INCLINED HER ALMOST
TO DOUBT HIS REAL CONCURRENCE; AND YET THERE MUST BE A VERY DISTINCT
SORT OF ELEGANCE FOR THE FASHIONABLE WORLD, IF JANE FAIRFAX COULD
BE THOUGHT ONLY ORDINARILY GIFTED WITH IT.

"IF YOU WERE NEVER PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY HER MANNERS BEFORE,"
SAID SHE, "I THINK YOU WILL TO-DAY. YOU WILL SEE HER TO ADVANTAGE;
SEE HER AND HEAR HER--NO, I AM AFRAID YOU WILL NOT HEAR HER AT ALL,
FOR SHE HAS AN AUNT WHO NEVER HOLDS HER TONGUE."

"YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH MISS JANE FAIRFAX, SIR, ARE YOU?"
SAID MR. WOODHOUSE, ALWAYS THE LAST TO MAKE HIS WAY IN CONVERSATION;
"THEN GIVE ME LEAVE TO ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL FIND HER A VERY
AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY.  SHE IS STAYING HERE ON A VISIT TO HER GRANDMAMA
AND AUNT, VERY WORTHY PEOPLE; I HAVE KNOWN THEM ALL MY LIFE.
THEY WILL BE EXTREMELY GLAD TO SEE YOU, I AM SURE; AND ONE OF MY
SERVANTS SHALL GO WITH YOU TO SHEW YOU THE WAY."

"MY DEAR SIR, UPON NO ACCOUNT IN THE WORLD; MY FATHER CAN DIRECT ME."

"BUT YOUR FATHER IS NOT GOING SO FAR; HE IS ONLY GOING TO THE CROWN,
QUITE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET, AND THERE ARE A GREAT MANY HOUSES;
YOU MIGHT BE VERY MUCH AT A LOSS, AND IT IS A VERY DIRTY WALK,
UNLESS YOU KEEP ON THE FOOTPATH; BUT MY COACHMAN CAN TELL YOU
WHERE YOU HAD BEST CROSS THE STREET."

MR. FRANK CHURCHILL STILL DECLINED IT, LOOKING AS SERIOUS AS HE COULD,
AND HIS FATHER GAVE HIS HEARTY SUPPORT BY CALLING OUT, "MY GOOD FRIEND,
THIS IS QUITE UNNECESSARY; FRANK KNOWS A PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN HE
SEES IT, AND AS TO MRS. BATES'S, HE MAY GET THERE FROM THE CROWN
IN A HOP, STEP, AND JUMP."

THEY WERE PERMITTED TO GO ALONE; AND WITH A CORDIAL NOD FROM ONE,
AND A GRACEFUL BOW FROM THE OTHER, THE TWO GENTLEMEN TOOK LEAVE.
EMMA REMAINED VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THIS BEGINNING OF THE ACQUAINTANCE,
AND COULD NOW ENGAGE TO THINK OF THEM ALL AT RANDALLS ANY HOUR OF
THE DAY, WITH FULL CONFIDENCE IN THEIR COMFORT.



CHAPTER VI


THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AGAIN.  HE CAME WITH
MRS. WESTON, TO WHOM AND TO HIGHBURY HE SEEMED TO TAKE VERY CORDIALLY.
HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HER, IT APPEARED, MOST COMPANIONABLY AT HOME,
TILL HER USUAL HOUR OF EXERCISE; AND ON BEING DESIRED TO CHUSE
THEIR WALK, IMMEDIATELY FIXED ON HIGHBURY.--"HE DID NOT DOUBT THERE
BEING VERY PLEASANT WALKS IN EVERY DIRECTION, BUT IF LEFT TO HIM,
HE SHOULD ALWAYS CHUSE THE SAME.  HIGHBURY, THAT AIRY, CHEERFUL,
HAPPY-LOOKING HIGHBURY, WOULD BE HIS CONSTANT ATTRACTION."--
HIGHBURY, WITH MRS. WESTON, STOOD FOR HARTFIELD; AND SHE TRUSTED TO
ITS BEARING THE SAME CONSTRUCTION WITH HIM.  THEY WALKED THITHER DIRECTLY.

EMMA HAD HARDLY EXPECTED THEM:  FOR MR. WESTON, WHO HAD CALLED IN
FOR HALF A MINUTE, IN ORDER TO HEAR THAT HIS SON WAS VERY HANDSOME,
KNEW NOTHING OF THEIR PLANS; AND IT WAS AN AGREEABLE SURPRIZE
TO HER, THEREFORE, TO PERCEIVE THEM WALKING UP TO THE HOUSE TOGETHER,
ARM IN ARM.  SHE WAS WANTING TO SEE HIM AGAIN, AND ESPECIALLY
TO SEE HIM IN COMPANY WITH MRS. WESTON, UPON HIS BEHAVIOUR TO WHOM
HER OPINION OF HIM WAS TO DEPEND.  IF HE WERE DEFICIENT THERE,
NOTHING SHOULD MAKE AMENDS FOR IT.  BUT ON SEEING THEM TOGETHER,
SHE BECAME PERFECTLY SATISFIED.  IT WAS NOT MERELY IN FINE WORDS
OR HYPERBOLICAL COMPLIMENT THAT HE PAID HIS DUTY; NOTHING COULD BE
MORE PROPER OR PLEASING THAN HIS WHOLE MANNER TO HER--NOTHING COULD
MORE AGREEABLY DENOTE HIS WISH OF CONSIDERING HER AS A FRIEND AND
SECURING HER AFFECTION.  AND THERE WAS TIME ENOUGH FOR EMMA TO FORM A
REASONABLE JUDGMENT, AS THEIR VISIT INCLUDED ALL THE REST OF THE MORNING.
THEY WERE ALL THREE WALKING ABOUT TOGETHER FOR AN HOUR OR TWO--
FIRST ROUND THE SHRUBBERIES OF HARTFIELD, AND AFTERWARDS IN HIGHBURY.
HE WAS DELIGHTED WITH EVERY THING; ADMIRED HARTFIELD SUFFICIENTLY
FOR MR. WOODHOUSE'S EAR; AND WHEN THEIR GOING FARTHER WAS RESOLVED ON,
CONFESSED HIS WISH TO BE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE WHOLE VILLAGE,
AND FOUND MATTER OF COMMENDATION AND INTEREST MUCH OFTENER THAN EMMA
COULD HAVE SUPPOSED.

SOME OF THE OBJECTS OF HIS CURIOSITY SPOKE VERY AMIABLE FEELINGS.
HE BEGGED TO BE SHEWN THE HOUSE WHICH HIS FATHER HAD LIVED IN SO LONG,
AND WHICH HAD BEEN THE HOME OF HIS FATHER'S FATHER; AND ON RECOLLECTING
THAT AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD NURSED HIM WAS STILL LIVING, WALKED IN QUEST
OF HER COTTAGE FROM ONE END OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER; AND THOUGH
IN SOME POINTS OF PURSUIT OR OBSERVATION THERE WAS NO POSITIVE MERIT,
THEY SHEWED, ALTOGETHER, A GOOD-WILL TOWARDS HIGHBURY IN GENERAL,
WHICH MUST BE VERY LIKE A MERIT TO THOSE HE WAS WITH.

EMMA WATCHED AND DECIDED, THAT WITH SUCH FEELINGS AS WERE NOW SHEWN,
IT COULD NOT BE FAIRLY SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD BEEN EVER VOLUNTARILY
ABSENTING HIMSELF; THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ACTING A PART, OR MAKING
A PARADE OF INSINCERE PROFESSIONS; AND THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY CERTAINLY
HAD NOT DONE HIM JUSTICE.

THEIR FIRST PAUSE WAS AT THE CROWN INN, AN INCONSIDERABLE HOUSE,
THOUGH THE PRINCIPAL ONE OF THE SORT, WHERE A COUPLE OF PAIR OF
POST-HORSES WERE KEPT, MORE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
THAN FROM ANY RUN ON THE ROAD; AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD NOT EXPECTED
TO BE DETAINED BY ANY INTEREST EXCITED THERE; BUT IN PASSING IT THEY
GAVE THE HISTORY OF THE LARGE ROOM VISIBLY ADDED; IT HAD BEEN BUILT
MANY YEARS AGO FOR A BALL-ROOM, AND WHILE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD BEEN
IN A PARTICULARLY POPULOUS, DANCING STATE, HAD BEEN OCCASIONALLY USED
AS SUCH;--BUT SUCH BRILLIANT DAYS HAD LONG PASSED AWAY, AND NOW THE
HIGHEST PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS EVER WANTED WAS TO ACCOMMODATE A WHIST
CLUB ESTABLISHED AMONG THE GENTLEMEN AND HALF-GENTLEMEN OF THE PLACE.
HE WAS IMMEDIATELY INTERESTED.  ITS CHARACTER AS A BALL-ROOM CAUGHT HIM;
AND INSTEAD OF PASSING ON, HE STOPT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AT THE TWO
SUPERIOR SASHED WINDOWS WHICH WERE OPEN, TO LOOK IN AND CONTEMPLATE
ITS CAPABILITIES, AND LAMENT THAT ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE SHOULD
HAVE CEASED.  HE SAW NO FAULT IN THE ROOM, HE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE
NONE WHICH THEY SUGGESTED.  NO, IT WAS LONG ENOUGH, BROAD ENOUGH,
HANDSOME ENOUGH.  IT WOULD HOLD THE VERY NUMBER FOR COMFORT.
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BALLS THERE AT LEAST EVERY FORTNIGHT THROUGH
THE WINTER.  WHY HAD NOT MISS WOODHOUSE REVIVED THE FORMER GOOD
OLD DAYS OF THE ROOM?--SHE WHO COULD DO ANY THING IN HIGHBURY!
THE WANT OF PROPER FAMILIES IN THE PLACE, AND THE CONVICTION
THAT NONE BEYOND THE PLACE AND ITS IMMEDIATE ENVIRONS COULD BE
TEMPTED TO ATTEND, WERE MENTIONED; BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED.
HE COULD NOT BE PERSUADED THAT SO MANY GOOD-LOOKING HOUSES AS HE SAW
AROUND HIM, COULD NOT FURNISH NUMBERS ENOUGH FOR SUCH A MEETING;
AND EVEN WHEN PARTICULARS WERE GIVEN AND FAMILIES DESCRIBED, HE WAS
STILL UNWILLING TO ADMIT THAT THE INCONVENIENCE OF SUCH A MIXTURE
WOULD BE ANY THING, OR THAT THERE WOULD BE THE SMALLEST DIFFICULTY
IN EVERY BODY'S RETURNING INTO THEIR PROPER PLACE THE NEXT MORNING.
HE ARGUED LIKE A YOUNG MAN VERY MUCH BENT ON DANCING; AND EMMA
WAS RATHER SURPRIZED TO SEE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WESTON PREVAIL
SO DECIDEDLY AGAINST THE HABITS OF THE CHURCHILLS.  HE SEEMED TO HAVE
ALL THE LIFE AND SPIRIT, CHEERFUL FEELINGS, AND SOCIAL INCLINATIONS
OF HIS FATHER, AND NOTHING OF THE PRIDE OR RESERVE OF ENSCOMBE.
OF PRIDE, INDEED, THERE WAS, PERHAPS, SCARCELY ENOUGH; HIS INDIFFERENCE
TO A CONFUSION OF RANK, BORDERED TOO MUCH ON INELEGANCE OF MIND.
HE COULD BE NO JUDGE, HOWEVER, OF THE EVIL HE WAS HOLDING CHEAP.
IT WAS BUT AN EFFUSION OF LIVELY SPIRITS.

AT LAST HE WAS PERSUADED TO MOVE ON FROM THE FRONT OF THE CROWN;
AND BEING NOW ALMOST FACING THE HOUSE WHERE THE BATESES LODGED,
EMMA RECOLLECTED HIS INTENDED VISIT THE DAY BEFORE, AND ASKED HIM
IF HE HAD PAID IT.

"YES, OH! YES"--HE REPLIED; "I WAS JUST GOING TO MENTION IT.
A VERY SUCCESSFUL VISIT:--I SAW ALL THE THREE LADIES; AND FELT VERY
MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR PREPARATORY HINT.  IF THE TALKING AUNT
HAD TAKEN ME QUITE BY SURPRIZE, IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF ME.
AS IT WAS, I WAS ONLY BETRAYED INTO PAYING A MOST UNREASONABLE VISIT.
TEN MINUTES WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY, PERHAPS ALL THAT
WAS PROPER; AND I HAD TOLD MY FATHER I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE AT HOME
BEFORE HIM--BUT THERE WAS NO GETTING AWAY, NO PAUSE; AND, TO MY
UTTER ASTONISHMENT, I FOUND, WHEN HE (FINDING ME NOWHERE ELSE)
JOINED ME THERE AT LAST, THAT I HAD BEEN ACTUALLY SITTING WITH THEM
VERY NEARLY THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR.  THE GOOD LADY HAD NOT GIVEN ME
THE POSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE BEFORE."

"AND HOW DID YOU THINK MISS FAIRFAX LOOKING?"

"ILL, VERY ILL--THAT IS, IF A YOUNG LADY CAN EVER BE ALLOWED TO LOOK ILL.
BUT THE EXPRESSION IS HARDLY ADMISSIBLE, MRS. WESTON, IS IT?
LADIES CAN NEVER LOOK ILL.  AND, SERIOUSLY, MISS FAIRFAX IS NATURALLY
SO PALE, AS ALMOST ALWAYS TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF ILL HEALTH.--
A MOST DEPLORABLE WANT OF COMPLEXION."

EMMA WOULD NOT AGREE TO THIS, AND BEGAN A WARM DEFENCE OF MISS
FAIRFAX'S COMPLEXION.  "IT WAS CERTAINLY NEVER BRILLIANT, BUT SHE
WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAVE A SICKLY HUE IN GENERAL; AND THERE WAS
A SOFTNESS AND DELICACY IN HER SKIN WHICH GAVE PECULIAR ELEGANCE
TO THE CHARACTER OF HER FACE."  HE LISTENED WITH ALL DUE DEFERENCE;
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD HEARD MANY PEOPLE SAY THE SAME--BUT YET HE
MUST CONFESS, THAT TO HIM NOTHING COULD MAKE AMENDS FOR THE WANT
OF THE FINE GLOW OF HEALTH.  WHERE FEATURES WERE INDIFFERENT,
A FINE COMPLEXION GAVE BEAUTY TO THEM ALL; AND WHERE THEY WERE GOOD,
THE EFFECT WAS--FORTUNATELY HE NEED NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE WHAT THE
EFFECT WAS.

"WELL," SAID EMMA, "THERE IS NO DISPUTING ABOUT TASTE.--AT LEAST
YOU ADMIRE HER EXCEPT HER COMPLEXION."

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED.--"I CANNOT SEPARATE MISS FAIRFAX
AND HER COMPLEXION."

"DID YOU SEE HER OFTEN AT WEYMOUTH?  WERE YOU OFTEN IN THE SAME SOCIETY?"

AT THIS MOMENT THEY WERE APPROACHING FORD'S, AND HE HASTILY EXCLAIMED,
"HA! THIS MUST BE THE VERY SHOP THAT EVERY BODY ATTENDS EVERY DAY
OF THEIR LIVES, AS MY FATHER INFORMS ME.  HE COMES TO HIGHBURY HIMSELF,
HE SAYS, SIX DAYS OUT OF THE SEVEN, AND HAS ALWAYS BUSINESS AT FORD'S.
IF IT BE NOT INCONVENIENT TO YOU, PRAY LET US GO IN, THAT I MAY PROVE
MYSELF TO BELONG TO THE PLACE, TO BE A TRUE CITIZEN OF HIGHBURY.
I MUST BUY SOMETHING AT FORD'S. IT WILL BE TAKING OUT MY FREEDOM.--
I DARE SAY THEY SELL GLOVES."

"OH! YES, GLOVES AND EVERY THING.  I DO ADMIRE YOUR PATRIOTISM.
YOU WILL BE ADORED IN HIGHBURY.  YOU WERE VERY POPULAR BEFORE YOU CAME,
BECAUSE YOU WERE MR. WESTON'S SON--BUT LAY OUT HALF A GUINEA AT
FORD'S, AND YOUR POPULARITY WILL STAND UPON YOUR OWN VIRTUES."

THEY WENT IN; AND WHILE THE SLEEK, WELL-TIED PARCELS OF "MEN'S BEAVERS"
AND "YORK TAN" WERE BRINGING DOWN AND DISPLAYING ON THE COUNTER,
HE SAID--"BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON, MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU WERE SPEAKING
TO ME, YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING AT THE VERY MOMENT OF THIS BURST
OF MY _AMOR_ _PATRIAE_.  DO NOT LET ME LOSE IT.  I ASSURE YOU THE UTMOST
STRETCH OF PUBLIC FAME WOULD NOT MAKE ME AMENDS FOR THE LOSS OF ANY
HAPPINESS IN PRIVATE LIFE."

"I MERELY ASKED, WHETHER YOU HAD KNOWN MUCH OF MISS FAIRFAX
AND HER PARTY AT WEYMOUTH."

"AND NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION, I MUST PRONOUNCE IT TO BE A
VERY UNFAIR ONE.  IT IS ALWAYS THE LADY'S RIGHT TO DECIDE ON THE DEGREE
OF ACQUAINTANCE.  MISS FAIRFAX MUST ALREADY HAVE GIVEN HER ACCOUNT.--
I SHALL NOT COMMIT MYSELF BY CLAIMING MORE THAN SHE MAY CHUSE TO ALLOW."

"UPON MY WORD! YOU ANSWER AS DISCREETLY AS SHE COULD DO HERSELF.
BUT HER ACCOUNT OF EVERY THING LEAVES SO MUCH TO BE GUESSED,
SHE IS SO VERY RESERVED, SO VERY UNWILLING TO GIVE THE LEAST
INFORMATION ABOUT ANY BODY, THAT I REALLY THINK YOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU
LIKE OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER."

"MAY I, INDEED?--THEN I WILL SPEAK THE TRUTH, AND NOTHING SUITS ME
SO WELL.  I MET HER FREQUENTLY AT WEYMOUTH.  I HAD KNOWN THE CAMPBELLS
A LITTLE IN TOWN; AND AT WEYMOUTH WE WERE VERY MUCH IN THE SAME SET.
COLONEL CAMPBELL IS A VERY AGREEABLE MAN, AND MRS. CAMPBELL A FRIENDLY,
WARM-HEARTED WOMAN.  I LIKE THEM ALL."

"YOU KNOW MISS FAIRFAX'S SITUATION IN LIFE, I CONCLUDE; WHAT SHE
IS DESTINED TO BE?"

"YES--(RATHER HESITATINGLY)--I BELIEVE I DO."

"YOU GET UPON DELICATE SUBJECTS, EMMA," SAID MRS. WESTON SMILING;
"REMEMBER THAT I AM HERE.--MR. FRANK CHURCHILL HARDLY KNOWS
WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU SPEAK OF MISS FAIRFAX'S SITUATION IN LIFE.
I WILL MOVE A LITTLE FARTHER OFF."

"I CERTAINLY DO FORGET TO THINK OF _HER_," SAID EMMA, "AS HAVING EVER
BEEN ANY THING BUT MY FRIEND AND MY DEAREST FRIEND."

HE LOOKED AS IF HE FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND HONOURED SUCH A SENTIMENT.

WHEN THE GLOVES WERE BOUGHT, AND THEY HAD QUITTED THE SHOP AGAIN,
"DID YOU EVER HEAR THE YOUNG LADY WE WERE SPEAKING OF, PLAY?"
SAID FRANK CHURCHILL.

"EVER HEAR HER!" REPEATED EMMA.  "YOU FORGET HOW MUCH SHE BELONGS
TO HIGHBURY.  I HAVE HEARD HER EVERY YEAR OF OUR LIVES SINCE WE
BOTH BEGAN.  SHE PLAYS CHARMINGLY."

"YOU THINK SO, DO YOU?--I WANTED THE OPINION OF SOME ONE WHO
COULD REALLY JUDGE.  SHE APPEARED TO ME TO PLAY WELL, THAT IS,
WITH CONSIDERABLE TASTE, BUT I KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER MYSELF.--
I AM EXCESSIVELY FOND OF MUSIC, BUT WITHOUT THE SMALLEST SKILL
OR RIGHT OF JUDGING OF ANY BODY'S PERFORMANCE.--I HAVE BEEN USED
TO HEAR HER'S ADMIRED; AND I REMEMBER ONE PROOF OF HER BEING
THOUGHT TO PLAY WELL:--A MAN, A VERY MUSICAL MAN, AND IN LOVE
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN--ENGAGED TO HER--ON THE POINT OF MARRIAGE--
WOULD YET NEVER ASK THAT OTHER WOMAN TO SIT DOWN TO THE INSTRUMENT,
IF THE LADY IN QUESTION COULD SIT DOWN INSTEAD--NEVER SEEMED
TO LIKE TO HEAR ONE IF HE COULD HEAR THE OTHER.  THAT, I THOUGHT,
IN A MAN OF KNOWN MUSICAL TALENT, WAS SOME PROOF."

"PROOF INDEED!" SAID EMMA, HIGHLY AMUSED.--"MR. DIXON IS VERY MUSICAL,
IS HE?  WE SHALL KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM ALL, IN HALF AN HOUR, FROM YOU,
THAN MISS FAIRFAX WOULD HAVE VOUCHSAFED IN HALF A YEAR."

"YES, MR. DIXON AND MISS CAMPBELL WERE THE PERSONS; AND I THOUGHT
IT A VERY STRONG PROOF."

"CERTAINLY--VERY STRONG IT WAS; TO OWN THE TRUTH, A GREAT DEAL
STRONGER THAN, IF _I_ HAD BEEN MISS CAMPBELL, WOULD HAVE BEEN AT ALL
AGREEABLE TO ME.  I COULD NOT EXCUSE A MAN'S HAVING MORE MUSIC
THAN LOVE--MORE EAR THAN EYE--A MORE ACUTE SENSIBILITY TO FINE
SOUNDS THAN TO MY FEELINGS.  HOW DID MISS CAMPBELL APPEAR TO LIKE IT?"

"IT WAS HER VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND, YOU KNOW."

"POOR COMFORT!" SAID EMMA, LAUGHING.  "ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE A STRANGER
PREFERRED THAN ONE'S VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND--WITH A STRANGER IT MIGHT
NOT RECUR AGAIN--BUT THE MISERY OF HAVING A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND
ALWAYS AT HAND, TO DO EVERY THING BETTER THAN ONE DOES ONESELF!--
POOR MRS. DIXON!  WELL, I AM GLAD SHE IS GONE TO SETTLE IN IRELAND."

"YOU ARE RIGHT.  IT WAS NOT VERY FLATTERING TO MISS CAMPBELL;
BUT SHE REALLY DID NOT SEEM TO FEEL IT."

"SO MUCH THE BETTER--OR SO MUCH THE WORSE:--I DO NOT KNOW WHICH.
BUT BE IT SWEETNESS OR BE IT STUPIDITY IN HER--QUICKNESS OF FRIENDSHIP,
OR DULNESS OF FEELING--THERE WAS ONE PERSON, I THINK, WHO MUST HAVE
FELT IT:  MISS FAIRFAX HERSELF.  SHE MUST HAVE FELT THE IMPROPER
AND DANGEROUS DISTINCTION."

"AS TO THAT--I DO NOT--"

"OH! DO NOT IMAGINE THAT I EXPECT AN ACCOUNT OF MISS FAIRFAX'S
SENSATIONS FROM YOU, OR FROM ANY BODY ELSE.  THEY ARE KNOWN TO NO
HUMAN BEING, I GUESS, BUT HERSELF.  BUT IF SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY
WHENEVER SHE WAS ASKED BY MR. DIXON, ONE MAY GUESS WHAT ONE CHUSES."

"THERE APPEARED SUCH A PERFECTLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING AMONG THEM ALL--"
HE BEGAN RATHER QUICKLY, BUT CHECKING HIMSELF, ADDED, "HOWEVER, IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY ON WHAT TERMS THEY REALLY WERE--
HOW IT MIGHT ALL BE BEHIND THE SCENES.  I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THERE
WAS SMOOTHNESS OUTWARDLY.  BUT YOU, WHO HAVE KNOWN MISS FAIRFAX FROM
A CHILD, MUST BE A BETTER JUDGE OF HER CHARACTER, AND OF HOW SHE
IS LIKELY TO CONDUCT HERSELF IN CRITICAL SITUATIONS, THAN I CAN BE."

"I HAVE KNOWN HER FROM A CHILD, UNDOUBTEDLY; WE HAVE BEEN CHILDREN
AND WOMEN TOGETHER; AND IT IS NATURAL TO SUPPOSE THAT WE SHOULD
BE INTIMATE,--THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN TO EACH OTHER WHENEVER
SHE VISITED HER FRIENDS.  BUT WE NEVER DID.  I HARDLY KNOW HOW IT
HAS HAPPENED; A LITTLE, PERHAPS, FROM THAT WICKEDNESS ON MY SIDE
WHICH WAS PRONE TO TAKE DISGUST TOWARDS A GIRL SO IDOLIZED
AND SO CRIED UP AS SHE ALWAYS WAS, BY HER AUNT AND GRANDMOTHER,
AND ALL THEIR SET.  AND THEN, HER RESERVE--I NEVER COULD ATTACH
MYSELF TO ANY ONE SO COMPLETELY RESERVED."

"IT IS A MOST REPULSIVE QUALITY, INDEED," SAID HE.  "OFTENTIMES
VERY CONVENIENT, NO DOUBT, BUT NEVER PLEASING.  THERE IS SAFETY
IN RESERVE, BUT NO ATTRACTION.  ONE CANNOT LOVE A RESERVED PERSON."

"NOT TILL THE RESERVE CEASES TOWARDS ONESELF; AND THEN THE ATTRACTION
MAY BE THE GREATER.  BUT I MUST BE MORE IN WANT OF A FRIEND,
OR AN AGREEABLE COMPANION, THAN I HAVE YET BEEN, TO TAKE
THE TROUBLE OF CONQUERING ANY BODY'S RESERVE TO PROCURE ONE.
INTIMACY BETWEEN MISS FAIRFAX AND ME IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION.
I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK ILL OF HER--NOT THE LEAST--EXCEPT THAT
SUCH EXTREME AND PERPETUAL CAUTIOUSNESS OF WORD AND MANNER,
SUCH A DREAD OF GIVING A DISTINCT IDEA ABOUT ANY BODY, IS APT
TO SUGGEST SUSPICIONS OF THERE BEING SOMETHING TO CONCEAL."

HE PERFECTLY AGREED WITH HER:  AND AFTER WALKING TOGETHER SO LONG,
AND THINKING SO MUCH ALIKE, EMMA FELT HERSELF SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIM,
THAT SHE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT TO BE ONLY THEIR SECOND MEETING.
HE WAS NOT EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED; LESS OF THE MAN OF THE
WORLD IN SOME OF HIS NOTIONS, LESS OF THE SPOILED CHILD OF FORTUNE,
THEREFORE BETTER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED.  HIS IDEAS SEEMED MORE MODERATE--
HIS FEELINGS WARMER.  SHE WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY HIS MANNER
OF CONSIDERING MR. ELTON'S HOUSE, WHICH, AS WELL AS THE CHURCH,
HE WOULD GO AND LOOK AT, AND WOULD NOT JOIN THEM IN FINDING MUCH
FAULT WITH.  NO, HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT A BAD HOUSE; NOT SUCH A HOUSE
AS A MAN WAS TO BE PITIED FOR HAVING.  IF IT WERE TO BE SHARED WITH
THE WOMAN HE LOVED, HE COULD NOT THINK ANY MAN TO BE PITIED FOR HAVING
THAT HOUSE.  THERE MUST BE AMPLE ROOM IN IT FOR EVERY REAL COMFORT.
THE MAN MUST BE A BLOCKHEAD WHO WANTED MORE.

MRS. WESTON LAUGHED, AND SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
USED ONLY TO A LARGE HOUSE HIMSELF, AND WITHOUT EVER THINKING HOW MANY
ADVANTAGES AND ACCOMMODATIONS WERE ATTACHED TO ITS SIZE, HE COULD
BE NO JUDGE OF THE PRIVATIONS INEVITABLY BELONGING TO A SMALL ONE.
BUT EMMA, IN HER OWN MIND, DETERMINED THAT HE _DID_ KNOW WHAT HE
WAS TALKING ABOUT, AND THAT HE SHEWED A VERY AMIABLE INCLINATION
TO SETTLE EARLY IN LIFE, AND TO MARRY, FROM WORTHY MOTIVES.
HE MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF THE INROADS ON DOMESTIC PEACE TO BE
OCCASIONED BY NO HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM, OR A BAD BUTLER'S PANTRY,
BUT NO DOUBT HE DID PERFECTLY FEEL THAT ENSCOMBE COULD NOT MAKE
HIM HAPPY, AND THAT WHENEVER HE WERE ATTACHED, HE WOULD WILLINGLY
GIVE UP MUCH OF WEALTH TO BE ALLOWED AN EARLY ESTABLISHMENT.



CHAPTER VII


EMMA'S VERY GOOD OPINION OF FRANK CHURCHILL WAS A LITTLE SHAKEN
THE FOLLOWING DAY, BY HEARING THAT HE WAS GONE OFF TO LONDON,
MERELY TO HAVE HIS HAIR CUT.  A SUDDEN FREAK SEEMED TO HAVE SEIZED HIM
AT BREAKFAST, AND HE HAD SENT FOR A CHAISE AND SET OFF, INTENDING TO
RETURN TO DINNER, BUT WITH NO MORE IMPORTANT VIEW THAT APPEARED THAN
HAVING HIS HAIR CUT.  THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO HARM IN HIS TRAVELLING
SIXTEEN MILES TWICE OVER ON SUCH AN ERRAND; BUT THERE WAS AN AIR
OF FOPPERY AND NONSENSE IN IT WHICH SHE COULD NOT APPROVE.  IT DID
NOT ACCORD WITH THE RATIONALITY OF PLAN, THE MODERATION IN EXPENSE,
OR EVEN THE UNSELFISH WARMTH OF HEART, WHICH SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF
TO DISCERN IN HIM YESTERDAY.  VANITY, EXTRAVAGANCE, LOVE OF CHANGE,
RESTLESSNESS OF TEMPER, WHICH MUST BE DOING SOMETHING, GOOD OR BAD;
HEEDLESSNESS AS TO THE PLEASURE OF HIS FATHER AND MRS. WESTON,
INDIFFERENT AS TO HOW HIS CONDUCT MIGHT APPEAR IN GENERAL; HE BECAME
LIABLE TO ALL THESE CHARGES.  HIS FATHER ONLY CALLED HIM A COXCOMB,
AND THOUGHT IT A VERY GOOD STORY; BUT THAT MRS. WESTON DID NOT LIKE IT,
WAS CLEAR ENOUGH, BY HER PASSING IT OVER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE,
AND MAKING NO OTHER COMMENT THAN THAT "ALL YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
THEIR LITTLE WHIMS."

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS LITTLE BLOT, EMMA FOUND THAT HIS VISIT
HITHERTO HAD GIVEN HER FRIEND ONLY GOOD IDEAS OF HIM.  MRS. WESTON
WAS VERY READY TO SAY HOW ATTENTIVE AND PLEASANT A COMPANION HE
MADE HIMSELF--HOW MUCH SHE SAW TO LIKE IN HIS DISPOSITION ALTOGETHER.
HE APPEARED TO HAVE A VERY OPEN TEMPER--CERTAINLY A VERY CHEERFUL
AND LIVELY ONE; SHE COULD OBSERVE NOTHING WRONG IN HIS NOTIONS,
A GREAT DEAL DECIDEDLY RIGHT; HE SPOKE OF HIS UNCLE WITH WARM REGARD,
WAS FOND OF TALKING OF HIM--SAID HE WOULD BE THE BEST MAN IN THE
WORLD IF HE WERE LEFT TO HIMSELF; AND THOUGH THERE WAS NO BEING
ATTACHED TO THE AUNT, HE ACKNOWLEDGED HER KINDNESS WITH GRATITUDE,
AND SEEMED TO MEAN ALWAYS TO SPEAK OF HER WITH RESPECT.
THIS WAS ALL VERY PROMISING; AND, BUT FOR SUCH AN UNFORTUNATE FANCY
FOR HAVING HIS HAIR CUT, THERE WAS NOTHING TO DENOTE HIM UNWORTHY
OF THE DISTINGUISHED HONOUR WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD GIVEN HIM;
THE HONOUR, IF NOT OF BEING REALLY IN LOVE WITH HER, OF BEING
AT LEAST VERY NEAR IT, AND SAVED ONLY BY HER OWN INDIFFERENCE--
(FOR STILL HER RESOLUTION HELD OF NEVER MARRYING)--THE HONOUR, IN SHORT,
OF BEING MARKED OUT FOR HER BY ALL THEIR JOINT ACQUAINTANCE.

MR. WESTON, ON HIS SIDE, ADDED A VIRTUE TO THE ACCOUNT WHICH MUST
HAVE SOME WEIGHT.  HE GAVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT FRANK ADMIRED
HER EXTREMELY--THOUGHT HER VERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY CHARMING;
AND WITH SO MUCH TO BE SAID FOR HIM ALTOGETHER, SHE FOUND SHE MUST
NOT JUDGE HIM HARSHLY.  AS MRS. WESTON OBSERVED, "ALL YOUNG PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE THEIR LITTLE WHIMS."

THERE WAS ONE PERSON AMONG HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE IN SURRY, NOT SO
LENIENTLY DISPOSED.  IN GENERAL HE WAS JUDGED, THROUGHOUT THE PARISHES
OF DONWELL AND HIGHBURY, WITH GREAT CANDOUR; LIBERAL ALLOWANCES
WERE MADE FOR THE LITTLE EXCESSES OF SUCH A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN--
ONE WHO SMILED SO OFTEN AND BOWED SO WELL; BUT THERE WAS ONE SPIRIT
AMONG THEM NOT TO BE SOFTENED, FROM ITS POWER OF CENSURE, BY BOWS
OR SMILES--MR. KNIGHTLEY.  THE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS TOLD HIM AT HARTFIELD;
FOR THE MOMENT, HE WAS SILENT; BUT EMMA HEARD HIM ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
AFTERWARDS SAY TO HIMSELF, OVER A NEWSPAPER HE HELD IN HIS HAND,
"HUM! JUST THE TRIFLING, SILLY FELLOW I TOOK HIM FOR."  SHE HAD
HALF A MIND TO RESENT; BUT AN INSTANT'S OBSERVATION CONVINCED
HER THAT IT WAS REALLY SAID ONLY TO RELIEVE HIS OWN FEELINGS,
AND NOT MEANT TO PROVOKE; AND THEREFORE SHE LET IT PASS.

ALTHOUGH IN ONE INSTANCE THE BEARERS OF NOT GOOD TIDINGS,
MR. AND MRS. WESTON'S VISIT THIS MORNING WAS IN ANOTHER RESPECT
PARTICULARLY OPPORTUNE.  SOMETHING OCCURRED WHILE THEY WERE
AT HARTFIELD, TO MAKE EMMA WANT THEIR ADVICE; AND, WHICH WAS
STILL MORE LUCKY, SHE WANTED EXACTLY THE ADVICE THEY GAVE.

THIS WAS THE OCCURRENCE:--THE COLES HAD BEEN SETTLED SOME YEARS
IN HIGHBURY, AND WERE VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE--FRIENDLY, LIBERAL,
AND UNPRETENDING; BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY WERE OF LOW ORIGIN,
IN TRADE, AND ONLY MODERATELY GENTEEL.  ON THEIR FIRST COMING INTO
THE COUNTRY, THEY HAD LIVED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR INCOME, QUIETLY,
KEEPING LITTLE COMPANY, AND THAT LITTLE UNEXPENSIVELY; BUT THE LAST
YEAR OR TWO HAD BROUGHT THEM A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE OF MEANS--
THE HOUSE IN TOWN HAD YIELDED GREATER PROFITS, AND FORTUNE IN GENERAL
HAD SMILED ON THEM.  WITH THEIR WEALTH, THEIR VIEWS INCREASED;
THEIR WANT OF A LARGER HOUSE, THEIR INCLINATION FOR MORE COMPANY.
THEY ADDED TO THEIR HOUSE, TO THEIR NUMBER OF SERVANTS,
TO THEIR EXPENSES OF EVERY SORT; AND BY THIS TIME WERE, IN FORTUNE
AND STYLE OF LIVING, SECOND ONLY TO THE FAMILY AT HARTFIELD.
THEIR LOVE OF SOCIETY, AND THEIR NEW DINING-ROOM, PREPARED EVERY BODY
FOR THEIR KEEPING DINNER-COMPANY; AND A FEW PARTIES, CHIEFLY AMONG
THE SINGLE MEN, HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE.  THE REGULAR AND BEST
FAMILIES EMMA COULD HARDLY SUPPOSE THEY WOULD PRESUME TO INVITE--
NEITHER DONWELL, NOR HARTFIELD, NOR RANDALLS.  NOTHING SHOULD
TEMPT _HER_ TO GO, IF THEY DID; AND SHE REGRETTED THAT HER FATHER'S
KNOWN HABITS WOULD BE GIVING HER REFUSAL LESS MEANING THAN SHE
COULD WISH.  THE COLES WERE VERY RESPECTABLE IN THEIR WAY, BUT THEY
OUGHT TO BE TAUGHT THAT IT WAS NOT FOR THEM TO ARRANGE THE TERMS
ON WHICH THE SUPERIOR FAMILIES WOULD VISIT THEM.  THIS LESSON,
SHE VERY MUCH FEARED, THEY WOULD RECEIVE ONLY FROM HERSELF;
SHE HAD LITTLE HOPE OF MR. KNIGHTLEY, NONE OF MR. WESTON.

BUT SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND HOW TO MEET THIS PRESUMPTION SO MANY
WEEKS BEFORE IT APPEARED, THAT WHEN THE INSULT CAME AT LAST,
IT FOUND HER VERY DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED.  DONWELL AND RANDALLS
HAD RECEIVED THEIR INVITATION, AND NONE HAD COME FOR HER FATHER
AND HERSELF; AND MRS. WESTON'S ACCOUNTING FOR IT WITH "I SUPPOSE
THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE LIBERTY WITH YOU; THEY KNOW YOU DO NOT
DINE OUT," WAS NOT QUITE SUFFICIENT.  SHE FELT THAT SHE SHOULD
LIKE TO HAVE HAD THE POWER OF REFUSAL; AND AFTERWARDS, AS THE IDEA
OF THE PARTY TO BE ASSEMBLED THERE, CONSISTING PRECISELY OF THOSE
WHOSE SOCIETY WAS DEAREST TO HER, OCCURRED AGAIN AND AGAIN,
SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO ACCEPT.
HARRIET WAS TO BE THERE IN THE EVENING, AND THE BATESES.  THEY HAD
BEEN SPEAKING OF IT AS THEY WALKED ABOUT HIGHBURY THE DAY BEFORE,
AND FRANK CHURCHILL HAD MOST EARNESTLY LAMENTED HER ABSENCE.
MIGHT NOT THE EVENING END IN A DANCE? HAD BEEN A QUESTION OF HIS.
THE BARE POSSIBILITY OF IT ACTED AS A FARTHER IRRITATION ON HER SPIRITS;
AND HER BEING LEFT IN SOLITARY GRANDEUR, EVEN SUPPOSING THE OMISSION
TO BE INTENDED AS A COMPLIMENT, WAS BUT POOR COMFORT.

IT WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THIS VERY INVITATION WHILE THE WESTONS WERE
AT HARTFIELD, WHICH MADE THEIR PRESENCE SO ACCEPTABLE; FOR THOUGH HER
FIRST REMARK, ON READING IT, WAS THAT "OF COURSE IT MUST BE DECLINED,"
SHE SO VERY SOON PROCEEDED TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY ADVISED HER TO DO,
THAT THEIR ADVICE FOR HER GOING WAS MOST PROMPT AND SUCCESSFUL.

SHE OWNED THAT, CONSIDERING EVERY THING, SHE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY
WITHOUT INCLINATION FOR THE PARTY.  THE COLES EXPRESSED THEMSELVES
SO PROPERLY--THERE WAS SO MUCH REAL ATTENTION IN THE MANNER OF IT--
SO MUCH CONSIDERATION FOR HER FATHER.  "THEY WOULD HAVE SOLICITED THE
HONOUR EARLIER, BUT HAD BEEN WAITING THE ARRIVAL OF A FOLDING-SCREEN
FROM LONDON, WHICH THEY HOPED MIGHT KEEP MR. WOODHOUSE FROM ANY DRAUGHT
OF AIR, AND THEREFORE INDUCE HIM THE MORE READILY TO GIVE THEM THE
HONOUR OF HIS COMPANY."  UPON THE WHOLE, SHE WAS VERY PERSUADABLE;
AND IT BEING BRIEFLY SETTLED AMONG THEMSELVES HOW IT MIGHT BE
DONE WITHOUT NEGLECTING HIS COMFORT--HOW CERTAINLY MRS. GODDARD,
IF NOT MRS. BATES, MIGHT BE DEPENDED ON FOR BEARING HIM COMPANY--
MR. WOODHOUSE WAS TO BE TALKED INTO AN ACQUIESCENCE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S
GOING OUT TO DINNER ON A DAY NOW NEAR AT HAND, AND SPENDING
THE WHOLE EVENING AWAY FROM HIM.  AS FOR _HIS_ GOING, EMMA DID
NOT WISH HIM TO THINK IT POSSIBLE, THE HOURS WOULD BE TOO LATE,
AND THE PARTY TOO NUMEROUS.  HE WAS SOON PRETTY WELL RESIGNED.

"I AM NOT FOND OF DINNER-VISITING," SAID HE--"I NEVER WAS.
NO MORE IS EMMA.  LATE HOURS DO NOT AGREE WITH US.  I AM SORRY
MR. AND MRS. COLE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT.  I THINK IT WOULD BE
MUCH BETTER IF THEY WOULD COME IN ONE AFTERNOON NEXT SUMMER,
AND TAKE THEIR TEA WITH US--TAKE US IN THEIR AFTERNOON WALK;
WHICH THEY MIGHT DO, AS OUR HOURS ARE SO REASONABLE, AND YET GET HOME
WITHOUT BEING OUT IN THE DAMP OF THE EVENING.  THE DEWS OF A SUMMER
EVENING ARE WHAT I WOULD NOT EXPOSE ANY BODY TO.  HOWEVER, AS THEY
ARE SO VERY DESIROUS TO HAVE DEAR EMMA DINE WITH THEM, AND AS YOU
WILL BOTH BE THERE, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY TOO, TO TAKE CARE OF HER,
I CANNOT WISH TO PREVENT IT, PROVIDED THE WEATHER BE WHAT IT OUGHT,
NEITHER DAMP, NOR COLD, NOR WINDY."  THEN TURNING TO MRS. WESTON,
WITH A LOOK OF GENTLE REPROACH--"AH!  MISS TAYLOR, IF YOU HAD
NOT MARRIED, YOU WOULD HAVE STAID AT HOME WITH ME."

"WELL, SIR," CRIED MR. WESTON, "AS I TOOK MISS TAYLOR AWAY,
IT IS INCUMBENT ON ME TO SUPPLY HER PLACE, IF I CAN; AND I WILL
STEP TO MRS. GODDARD IN A MOMENT, IF YOU WISH IT."

BUT THE IDEA OF ANY THING TO BE DONE IN A _MOMENT_, WAS INCREASING,
NOT LESSENING, MR. WOODHOUSE'S AGITATION.  THE LADIES KNEW BETTER
HOW TO ALLAY IT.  MR. WESTON MUST BE QUIET, AND EVERY THING
DELIBERATELY ARRANGED.

WITH THIS TREATMENT, MR. WOODHOUSE WAS SOON COMPOSED ENOUGH
FOR TALKING AS USUAL.  "HE SHOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE MRS. GODDARD.
HE HAD A GREAT REGARD FOR MRS. GODDARD; AND EMMA SHOULD WRITE A LINE,
AND INVITE HER.  JAMES COULD TAKE THE NOTE.  BUT FIRST OF ALL,
THERE MUST BE AN ANSWER WRITTEN TO MRS. COLE."

"YOU WILL MAKE MY EXCUSES, MY DEAR, AS CIVILLY AS POSSIBLE.  YOU WILL
SAY THAT I AM QUITE AN INVALID, AND GO NO WHERE, AND THEREFORE MUST
DECLINE THEIR OBLIGING INVITATION; BEGINNING WITH MY _COMPLIMENTS_,
OF COURSE.  BUT YOU WILL DO EVERY THING RIGHT.  I NEED NOT TELL YOU
WHAT IS TO BE DONE.  WE MUST REMEMBER TO LET JAMES KNOW THAT THE CARRIAGE
WILL BE WANTED ON TUESDAY.  I SHALL HAVE NO FEARS FOR YOU WITH HIM.
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE ABOVE ONCE SINCE THE NEW APPROACH WAS MADE;
BUT STILL I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT JAMES WILL TAKE YOU VERY SAFELY.
AND WHEN YOU GET THERE, YOU MUST TELL HIM AT WHAT TIME YOU WOULD
HAVE HIM COME FOR YOU AGAIN; AND YOU HAD BETTER NAME AN EARLY HOUR.
YOU WILL NOT LIKE STAYING LATE.  YOU WILL GET VERY TIRED WHEN TEA
IS OVER."

"BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH ME TO COME AWAY BEFORE I AM TIRED, PAPA?"

"OH! NO, MY LOVE; BUT YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED.  THERE WILL BE
A GREAT MANY PEOPLE TALKING AT ONCE.  YOU WILL NOT LIKE THE NOISE."

"BUT, MY DEAR SIR," CRIED MR. WESTON, "IF EMMA COMES AWAY EARLY,
IT WILL BE BREAKING UP THE PARTY."

"AND NO GREAT HARM IF IT DOES," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE.  "THE SOONER
EVERY PARTY BREAKS UP, THE BETTER."

"BUT YOU DO NOT CONSIDER HOW IT MAY APPEAR TO THE COLES.
EMMA'S GOING AWAY DIRECTLY AFTER TEA MIGHT BE GIVING OFFENCE.
THEY ARE GOOD-NATURED PEOPLE, AND THINK LITTLE OF THEIR OWN CLAIMS;
BUT STILL THEY MUST FEEL THAT ANY BODY'S HURRYING AWAY IS NO
GREAT COMPLIMENT; AND MISS WOODHOUSE'S DOING IT WOULD BE MORE THOUGHT
OF THAN ANY OTHER PERSON'S IN THE ROOM.  YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO DISAPPOINT
AND MORTIFY THE COLES, I AM SURE, SIR; FRIENDLY, GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE
AS EVER LIVED, AND WHO HAVE BEEN YOUR NEIGHBOURS THESE _TEN_ YEARS."

"NO, UPON NO ACCOUNT IN THE WORLD, MR. WESTON; I AM MUCH OBLIGED
TO YOU FOR REMINDING ME.  I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY SORRY TO BE GIVING
THEM ANY PAIN.  I KNOW WHAT WORTHY PEOPLE THEY ARE.  PERRY TELLS
ME THAT MR. COLE NEVER TOUCHES MALT LIQUOR.  YOU WOULD NOT THINK
IT TO LOOK AT HIM, BUT HE IS BILIOUS--MR. COLE IS VERY BILIOUS.
NO, I WOULD NOT BE THE MEANS OF GIVING THEM ANY PAIN.  MY DEAR EMMA,
WE MUST CONSIDER THIS.  I AM SURE, RATHER THAN RUN THE RISK OF HURTING
MR. AND MRS. COLE, YOU WOULD STAY A LITTLE LONGER THAN YOU MIGHT WISH.
YOU WILL NOT REGARD BEING TIRED.  YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY SAFE,
YOU KNOW, AMONG YOUR FRIENDS."

"OH YES, PAPA.  I HAVE NO FEARS AT ALL FOR MYSELF; AND I SHOULD HAVE
NO SCRUPLES OF STAYING AS LATE AS MRS. WESTON, BUT ON YOUR ACCOUNT.
I AM ONLY AFRAID OF YOUR SITTING UP FOR ME.  I AM NOT AFRAID
OF YOUR NOT BEING EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE WITH MRS. GODDARD.
SHE LOVES PIQUET, YOU KNOW; BUT WHEN SHE IS GONE HOME, I AM AFRAID
YOU WILL BE SITTING UP BY YOURSELF, INSTEAD OF GOING TO BED AT YOUR
USUAL TIME--AND THE IDEA OF THAT WOULD ENTIRELY DESTROY MY COMFORT.
YOU MUST PROMISE ME NOT TO SIT UP."

HE DID, ON THE CONDITION OF SOME PROMISES ON HER SIDE:  SUCH AS THAT,
IF SHE CAME HOME COLD, SHE WOULD BE SURE TO WARM HERSELF THOROUGHLY;
IF HUNGRY, THAT SHE WOULD TAKE SOMETHING TO EAT; THAT HER OWN MAID
SHOULD SIT UP FOR HER; AND THAT SERLE AND THE BUTLER SHOULD SEE
THAT EVERY THING WERE SAFE IN THE HOUSE, AS USUAL.



CHAPTER VIII


FRANK CHURCHILL CAME BACK AGAIN; AND IF HE KEPT HIS FATHER'S
DINNER WAITING, IT WAS NOT KNOWN AT HARTFIELD; FOR MRS. WESTON
WAS TOO ANXIOUS FOR HIS BEING A FAVOURITE WITH MR. WOODHOUSE,
TO BETRAY ANY IMPERFECTION WHICH COULD BE CONCEALED.

HE CAME BACK, HAD HAD HIS HAIR CUT, AND LAUGHED AT HIMSELF WITH
A VERY GOOD GRACE, BUT WITHOUT SEEMING REALLY AT ALL ASHAMED
OF WHAT HE HAD DONE.  HE HAD NO REASON TO WISH HIS HAIR LONGER,
TO CONCEAL ANY CONFUSION OF FACE; NO REASON TO WISH THE MONEY UNSPENT,
TO IMPROVE HIS SPIRITS.  HE WAS QUITE AS UNDAUNTED AND AS LIVELY
AS EVER; AND, AFTER SEEING HIM, EMMA THUS MORALISED TO HERSELF:--

"I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT OUGHT TO BE SO, BUT CERTAINLY SILLY THINGS
DO CEASE TO BE SILLY IF THEY ARE DONE BY SENSIBLE PEOPLE IN AN
IMPUDENT WAY.  WICKEDNESS IS ALWAYS WICKEDNESS, BUT FOLLY IS NOT
ALWAYS FOLLY.--IT DEPENDS UPON THE CHARACTER OF THOSE WHO HANDLE IT.
MR. KNIGHTLEY, HE IS _NOT_ A TRIFLING, SILLY YOUNG MAN.  IF HE WERE,
HE WOULD HAVE DONE THIS DIFFERENTLY.  HE WOULD EITHER HAVE GLORIED
IN THE ACHIEVEMENT, OR BEEN ASHAMED OF IT.  THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
EITHER THE OSTENTATION OF A COXCOMB, OR THE EVASIONS OF A MIND TOO
WEAK TO DEFEND ITS OWN VANITIES.--NO, I AM PERFECTLY SURE THAT HE
IS NOT TRIFLING OR SILLY."

WITH TUESDAY CAME THE AGREEABLE PROSPECT OF SEEING HIM AGAIN,
AND FOR A LONGER TIME THAN HITHERTO; OF JUDGING OF HIS GENERAL MANNERS,
AND BY INFERENCE, OF THE MEANING OF HIS MANNERS TOWARDS HERSELF;
OF GUESSING HOW SOON IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR HER TO THROW COLDNESS
INTO HER AIR; AND OF FANCYING WHAT THE OBSERVATIONS OF ALL THOSE
MIGHT BE, WHO WERE NOW SEEING THEM TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME.

SHE MEANT TO BE VERY HAPPY, IN SPITE OF THE SCENE BEING LAID AT
MR. COLE'S; AND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO FORGET THAT AMONG THE FAILINGS
OF MR. ELTON, EVEN IN THE DAYS OF HIS FAVOUR, NONE HAD DISTURBED
HER MORE THAN HIS PROPENSITY TO DINE WITH MR. COLE.

HER FATHER'S COMFORT WAS AMPLY SECURED, MRS. BATES AS WELL AS
MRS. GODDARD BEING ABLE TO COME; AND HER LAST PLEASING DUTY,
BEFORE SHE LEFT THE HOUSE, WAS TO PAY HER RESPECTS TO THEM AS
THEY SAT TOGETHER AFTER DINNER; AND WHILE HER FATHER WAS FONDLY
NOTICING THE BEAUTY OF HER DRESS, TO MAKE THE TWO LADIES ALL
THE AMENDS IN HER POWER, BY HELPING THEM TO LARGE SLICES OF CAKE
AND FULL GLASSES OF WINE, FOR WHATEVER UNWILLING SELF-DENIAL HIS
CARE OF THEIR CONSTITUTION MIGHT HAVE OBLIGED THEM TO PRACTISE
DURING THE MEAL.--SHE HAD PROVIDED A PLENTIFUL DINNER FOR THEM;
SHE WISHED SHE COULD KNOW THAT THEY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO EAT IT.

SHE FOLLOWED ANOTHER CARRIAGE TO MR. COLE'S DOOR; AND WAS PLEASED
TO SEE THAT IT WAS MR. KNIGHTLEY'S; FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY KEEPING
NO HORSES, HAVING LITTLE SPARE MONEY AND A GREAT DEAL OF HEALTH,
ACTIVITY, AND INDEPENDENCE, WAS TOO APT, IN EMMA'S OPINION, TO GET
ABOUT AS HE COULD, AND NOT USE HIS CARRIAGE SO OFTEN AS BECAME
THE OWNER OF DONWELL ABBEY.  SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SPEAKING
HER APPROBATION WHILE WARM FROM HER HEART, FOR HE STOPPED TO HAND HER OUT.

"THIS IS COMING AS YOU SHOULD DO," SAID SHE; "LIKE A GENTLEMAN.--
I AM QUITE GLAD TO SEE YOU."

HE THANKED HER, OBSERVING, "HOW LUCKY THAT WE SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE SAME
MOMENT! FOR, IF WE HAD MET FIRST IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, I DOUBT WHETHER
YOU WOULD HAVE DISCERNED ME TO BE MORE OF A GENTLEMAN THAN USUAL.--
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE DISTINGUISHED HOW I CAME, BY MY LOOK OR MANNER."

"YES I SHOULD, I AM SURE I SHOULD.  THERE IS ALWAYS A LOOK OF
CONSCIOUSNESS OR BUSTLE WHEN PEOPLE COME IN A WAY WHICH THEY KNOW
TO BE BENEATH THEM.  YOU THINK YOU CARRY IT OFF VERY WELL, I DARE SAY,
BUT WITH YOU IT IS A SORT OF BRAVADO, AN AIR OF AFFECTED UNCONCERN;
I ALWAYS OBSERVE IT WHENEVER I MEET YOU UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.
_NOW_ YOU HAVE NOTHING TO TRY FOR.  YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF BEING
SUPPOSED ASHAMED.  YOU ARE NOT STRIVING TO LOOK TALLER THAN ANY
BODY ELSE.  _NOW_ I SHALL REALLY BE VERY HAPPY TO WALK INTO THE SAME
ROOM WITH YOU."

"NONSENSICAL GIRL!" WAS HIS REPLY, BUT NOT AT ALL IN ANGER.

EMMA HAD AS MUCH REASON TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE REST OF THE PARTY
AS WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY.  SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH A CORDIAL RESPECT
WHICH COULD NOT BUT PLEASE, AND GIVEN ALL THE CONSEQUENCE SHE COULD
WISH FOR.  WHEN THE WESTONS ARRIVED, THE KINDEST LOOKS OF LOVE,
THE STRONGEST OF ADMIRATION WERE FOR HER, FROM BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE;
THE SON APPROACHED HER WITH A CHEERFUL EAGERNESS WHICH MARKED
HER AS HIS PECULIAR OBJECT, AND AT DINNER SHE FOUND HIM SEATED
BY HER--AND, AS SHE FIRMLY BELIEVED, NOT WITHOUT SOME DEXTERITY
ON HIS SIDE.

THE PARTY WAS RATHER LARGE, AS IT INCLUDED ONE OTHER FAMILY, A PROPER
UNOBJECTIONABLE COUNTRY FAMILY, WHOM THE COLES HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF
NAMING AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE, AND THE MALE PART OF MR. COX'S FAMILY,
THE LAWYER OF HIGHBURY.  THE LESS WORTHY FEMALES WERE TO COME
IN THE EVENING, WITH MISS BATES, MISS FAIRFAX, AND MISS SMITH;
BUT ALREADY, AT DINNER, THEY WERE TOO NUMEROUS FOR ANY SUBJECT
OF CONVERSATION TO BE GENERAL; AND, WHILE POLITICS AND MR. ELTON
WERE TALKED OVER, EMMA COULD FAIRLY SURRENDER ALL HER ATTENTION TO
THE PLEASANTNESS OF HER NEIGHBOUR.  THE FIRST REMOTE SOUND TO WHICH
SHE FELT HERSELF OBLIGED TO ATTEND, WAS THE NAME OF JANE FAIRFAX.
MRS. COLE SEEMED TO BE RELATING SOMETHING OF HER THAT WAS EXPECTED TO BE
VERY INTERESTING.  SHE LISTENED, AND FOUND IT WELL WORTH LISTENING TO.
THAT VERY DEAR PART OF EMMA, HER FANCY, RECEIVED AN AMUSING SUPPLY.
MRS. COLE WAS TELLING THAT SHE HAD BEEN CALLING ON MISS BATES,
AND AS SOON AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM HAD BEEN STRUCK BY THE SIGHT
OF A PIANOFORTE--A VERY ELEGANT LOOKING INSTRUMENT--NOT A GRAND,
BUT A LARGE-SIZED SQUARE PIANOFORTE; AND THE SUBSTANCE OF THE STORY,
THE END OF ALL THE DIALOGUE WHICH ENSUED OF SURPRIZE, AND INQUIRY,
AND CONGRATULATIONS ON HER SIDE, AND EXPLANATIONS ON MISS BATES'S, WAS,
THAT THIS PIANOFORTE HAD ARRIVED FROM BROADWOOD'S THE DAY BEFORE,
TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF BOTH AUNT AND NIECE--ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED;
THAT AT FIRST, BY MISS BATES'S ACCOUNT, JANE HERSELF WAS QUITE AT
A LOSS, QUITE BEWILDERED TO THINK WHO COULD POSSIBLY HAVE ORDERED IT--
BUT NOW, THEY WERE BOTH PERFECTLY SATISFIED THAT IT COULD BE FROM ONLY
ONE QUARTER;--OF COURSE IT MUST BE FROM COLONEL CAMPBELL.

"ONE CAN SUPPOSE NOTHING ELSE," ADDED MRS. COLE, "AND I WAS ONLY
SURPRIZED THAT THERE COULD EVER HAVE BEEN A DOUBT.  BUT JANE,
IT SEEMS, HAD A LETTER FROM THEM VERY LATELY, AND NOT A WORD WAS SAID
ABOUT IT.  SHE KNOWS THEIR WAYS BEST; BUT I SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THEIR
SILENCE AS ANY REASON FOR THEIR NOT MEANING TO MAKE THE PRESENT.
THEY MIGHT CHUSE TO SURPRIZE HER."

MRS. COLE HAD MANY TO AGREE WITH HER; EVERY BODY WHO SPOKE ON THE
SUBJECT WAS EQUALLY CONVINCED THAT IT MUST COME FROM COLONEL CAMPBELL,
AND EQUALLY REJOICED THAT SUCH A PRESENT HAD BEEN MADE; AND THERE
WERE ENOUGH READY TO SPEAK TO ALLOW EMMA TO THINK HER OWN WAY,
AND STILL LISTEN TO MRS. COLE.

"I DECLARE, I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I HAVE HEARD ANY THING THAT HAS GIVEN
ME MORE SATISFACTION!--IT ALWAYS HAS QUITE HURT ME THAT JANE FAIRFAX,
WHO PLAYS SO DELIGHTFULLY, SHOULD NOT HAVE AN INSTRUMENT.
IT SEEMED QUITE A SHAME, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW MANY HOUSES
THERE ARE WHERE FINE INSTRUMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY THROWN AWAY.
THIS IS LIKE GIVING OURSELVES A SLAP, TO BE SURE! AND IT WAS
BUT YESTERDAY I WAS TELLING MR. COLE, I REALLY WAS ASHAMED
TO LOOK AT OUR NEW GRAND PIANOFORTE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, WHILE I
DO NOT KNOW ONE NOTE FROM ANOTHER, AND OUR LITTLE GIRLS, WHO ARE
BUT JUST BEGINNING, PERHAPS MAY NEVER MAKE ANY THING OF IT;
AND THERE IS POOR JANE FAIRFAX, WHO IS MISTRESS OF MUSIC, HAS NOT
ANY THING OF THE NATURE OF AN INSTRUMENT, NOT EVEN THE PITIFULLEST
OLD SPINET IN THE WORLD, TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH.--I WAS SAYING THIS
TO MR. COLE BUT YESTERDAY, AND HE QUITE AGREED WITH ME; ONLY HE
IS SO PARTICULARLY FOND OF MUSIC THAT HE COULD NOT HELP INDULGING
HIMSELF IN THE PURCHASE, HOPING THAT SOME OF OUR GOOD NEIGHBOURS MIGHT
BE SO OBLIGING OCCASIONALLY TO PUT IT TO A BETTER USE THAN WE CAN;
AND THAT REALLY IS THE REASON WHY THE INSTRUMENT WAS BOUGHT--
OR ELSE I AM SURE WE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF IT.--WE ARE IN GREAT
HOPES THAT MISS WOODHOUSE MAY BE PREVAILED WITH TO TRY IT THIS EVENING."

MISS WOODHOUSE MADE THE PROPER ACQUIESCENCE; AND FINDING THAT NOTHING
MORE WAS TO BE ENTRAPPED FROM ANY COMMUNICATION OF MRS. COLE'S,
TURNED TO FRANK CHURCHILL.

"WHY DO YOU SMILE?" SAID SHE.

"NAY, WHY DO YOU?"

"ME!--I SUPPOSE I SMILE FOR PLEASURE AT COLONEL CAMPBELL'S BEING
SO RICH AND SO LIBERAL.--IT IS A HANDSOME PRESENT."

"VERY."

"I RATHER WONDER THAT IT WAS NEVER MADE BEFORE."

"PERHAPS MISS FAIRFAX HAS NEVER BEEN STAYING HERE SO LONG BEFORE."

"OR THAT HE DID NOT GIVE HER THE USE OF THEIR OWN INSTRUMENT--
WHICH MUST NOW BE SHUT UP IN LONDON, UNTOUCHED BY ANY BODY."

"THAT IS A GRAND PIANOFORTE, AND HE MIGHT THINK IT TOO LARGE
FOR MRS. BATES'S HOUSE."

"YOU MAY _SAY_ WHAT YOU CHUSE--BUT YOUR COUNTENANCE TESTIFIES
THAT YOUR _THOUGHTS_ ON THIS SUBJECT ARE VERY MUCH LIKE MINE."

"I DO NOT KNOW.  I RATHER BELIEVE YOU ARE GIVING ME MORE CREDIT FOR
ACUTENESS THAN I DESERVE.  I SMILE BECAUSE YOU SMILE, AND SHALL PROBABLY
SUSPECT WHATEVER I FIND YOU SUSPECT; BUT AT PRESENT I DO NOT SEE WHAT
THERE IS TO QUESTION.  IF COLONEL CAMPBELL IS NOT THE PERSON, WHO CAN BE?"

"WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MRS. DIXON?"

"MRS. DIXON! VERY TRUE INDEED.  I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF MRS. DIXON.
SHE MUST KNOW AS WELL AS HER FATHER, HOW ACCEPTABLE AN INSTRUMENT
WOULD BE; AND PERHAPS THE MODE OF IT, THE MYSTERY, THE SURPRIZE,
IS MORE LIKE A YOUNG WOMAN'S SCHEME THAN AN ELDERLY MAN'S. IT
IS MRS. DIXON, I DARE SAY.  I TOLD YOU THAT YOUR SUSPICIONS WOULD
GUIDE MINE."

"IF SO, YOU MUST EXTEND YOUR SUSPICIONS AND COMPREHEND _MR_. DIXON
IN THEM."

"MR. DIXON.--VERY WELL.  YES, I IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVE THAT IT MUST
BE THE JOINT PRESENT OF MR. AND MRS. DIXON.  WE WERE SPEAKING THE
OTHER DAY, YOU KNOW, OF HIS BEING SO WARM AN ADMIRER OF HER PERFORMANCE."

"YES, AND WHAT YOU TOLD ME ON THAT HEAD, CONFIRMED AN IDEA WHICH I
HAD ENTERTAINED BEFORE.--I DO NOT MEAN TO REFLECT UPON THE GOOD
INTENTIONS OF EITHER MR. DIXON OR MISS FAIRFAX, BUT I CANNOT HELP
SUSPECTING EITHER THAT, AFTER MAKING HIS PROPOSALS TO HER FRIEND,
HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH _HER_, OR THAT HE BECAME
CONSCIOUS OF A LITTLE ATTACHMENT ON HER SIDE.  ONE MIGHT GUESS
TWENTY THINGS WITHOUT GUESSING EXACTLY THE RIGHT; BUT I AM SURE
THERE MUST BE A PARTICULAR CAUSE FOR HER CHUSING TO COME TO HIGHBURY
INSTEAD OF GOING WITH THE CAMPBELLS TO IRELAND.  HERE, SHE MUST BE
LEADING A LIFE OF PRIVATION AND PENANCE; THERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ALL ENJOYMENT.  AS TO THE PRETENCE OF TRYING HER NATIVE AIR, I LOOK
UPON THAT AS A MERE EXCUSE.--IN THE SUMMER IT MIGHT HAVE PASSED;
BUT WHAT CAN ANY BODY'S NATIVE AIR DO FOR THEM IN THE MONTHS
OF JANUARY, FEBRUARY, AND MARCH?  GOOD FIRES AND CARRIAGES WOULD
BE MUCH MORE TO THE PURPOSE IN MOST CASES OF DELICATE HEALTH, AND I
DARE SAY IN HER'S. I DO NOT REQUIRE YOU TO ADOPT ALL MY SUSPICIONS,
THOUGH YOU MAKE SO NOBLE A PROFESSION OF DOING IT, BUT I HONESTLY
TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE."

"AND, UPON MY WORD, THEY HAVE AN AIR OF GREAT PROBABILITY.
MR. DIXON'S PREFERENCE OF HER MUSIC TO HER FRIEND'S, I CAN ANSWER
FOR BEING VERY DECIDED."

"AND THEN, HE SAVED HER LIFE.  DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THAT?--
A WATER PARTY; AND BY SOME ACCIDENT SHE WAS FALLING OVERBOARD.
HE CAUGHT HER."

"HE DID.  I WAS THERE--ONE OF THE PARTY."

"WERE YOU REALLY?--WELL!--BUT YOU OBSERVED NOTHING OF COURSE,
FOR IT SEEMS TO BE A NEW IDEA TO YOU.--IF I HAD BEEN THERE, I THINK
I SHOULD HAVE MADE SOME DISCOVERIES."

"I DARE SAY YOU WOULD; BUT I, SIMPLE I, SAW NOTHING BUT THE FACT,
THAT MISS FAIRFAX WAS NEARLY DASHED FROM THE VESSEL AND THAT MR. DIXON
CAUGHT HER.--IT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT.  AND THOUGH THE CONSEQUENT
SHOCK AND ALARM WAS VERY GREAT AND MUCH MORE DURABLE--INDEED I
BELIEVE IT WAS HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ANY OF US WERE COMFORTABLE AGAIN--
YET THAT WAS TOO GENERAL A SENSATION FOR ANY THING OF PECULIAR
ANXIETY TO BE OBSERVABLE.  I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT YOU
MIGHT NOT HAVE MADE DISCOVERIES."

THE CONVERSATION WAS HERE INTERRUPTED.  THEY WERE CALLED ON TO SHARE
IN THE AWKWARDNESS OF A RATHER LONG INTERVAL BETWEEN THE COURSES,
AND OBLIGED TO BE AS FORMAL AND AS ORDERLY AS THE OTHERS; BUT WHEN
THE TABLE WAS AGAIN SAFELY COVERED, WHEN EVERY CORNER DISH WAS PLACED
EXACTLY RIGHT, AND OCCUPATION AND EASE WERE GENERALLY RESTORED,
EMMA SAID,

"THE ARRIVAL OF THIS PIANOFORTE IS DECISIVE WITH ME.  I WANTED TO KNOW
A LITTLE MORE, AND THIS TELLS ME QUITE ENOUGH.  DEPEND UPON IT,
WE SHALL SOON HEAR THAT IT IS A PRESENT FROM MR. AND MRS. DIXON."

"AND IF THE DIXONS SHOULD ABSOLUTELY DENY ALL KNOWLEDGE OF IT WE
MUST CONCLUDE IT TO COME FROM THE CAMPBELLS."

"NO, I AM SURE IT IS NOT FROM THE CAMPBELLS.  MISS FAIRFAX KNOWS IT
IS NOT FROM THE CAMPBELLS, OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GUESSED AT FIRST.
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUZZLED, HAD SHE DARED FIX ON THEM.
I MAY NOT HAVE CONVINCED YOU PERHAPS, BUT I AM PERFECTLY CONVINCED
MYSELF THAT MR. DIXON IS A PRINCIPAL IN THE BUSINESS."

"INDEED YOU INJURE ME IF YOU SUPPOSE ME UNCONVINCED.  YOUR REASONINGS
CARRY MY JUDGMENT ALONG WITH THEM ENTIRELY.  AT FIRST, WHILE I
SUPPOSED YOU SATISFIED THAT COLONEL CAMPBELL WAS THE GIVER, I SAW
IT ONLY AS PATERNAL KINDNESS, AND THOUGHT IT THE MOST NATURAL THING
IN THE WORLD.  BUT WHEN YOU MENTIONED MRS. DIXON, I FELT HOW MUCH MORE
PROBABLE THAT IT SHOULD BE THE TRIBUTE OF WARM FEMALE FRIENDSHIP.
AND NOW I CAN SEE IT IN NO OTHER LIGHT THAN AS AN OFFERING OF LOVE."

THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO PRESS THE MATTER FARTHER.  THE CONVICTION
SEEMED REAL; HE LOOKED AS IF HE FELT IT.  SHE SAID NO MORE,
OTHER SUBJECTS TOOK THEIR TURN; AND THE REST OF THE DINNER PASSED AWAY;
THE DESSERT SUCCEEDED, THE CHILDREN CAME IN, AND WERE TALKED
TO AND ADMIRED AMID THE USUAL RATE OF CONVERSATION; A FEW CLEVER
THINGS SAID, A FEW DOWNRIGHT SILLY, BUT BY MUCH THE LARGER PROPORTION
NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER--NOTHING WORSE THAN EVERYDAY REMARKS,
DULL REPETITIONS, OLD NEWS, AND HEAVY JOKES.

THE LADIES HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, BEFORE THE OTHER LADIES,
IN THEIR DIFFERENT DIVISIONS, ARRIVED.  EMMA WATCHED THE ENTREE OF HER
OWN PARTICULAR LITTLE FRIEND; AND IF SHE COULD NOT EXULT IN HER DIGNITY
AND GRACE, SHE COULD NOT ONLY LOVE THE BLOOMING SWEETNESS AND THE
ARTLESS MANNER, BUT COULD MOST HEARTILY REJOICE IN THAT LIGHT, CHEERFUL,
UNSENTIMENTAL DISPOSITION WHICH ALLOWED HER SO MANY ALLEVIATIONS
OF PLEASURE, IN THE MIDST OF THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED AFFECTION.
THERE SHE SAT--AND WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED HOW MANY TEARS SHE HAD
BEEN LATELY SHEDDING?  TO BE IN COMPANY, NICELY DRESSED HERSELF
AND SEEING OTHERS NICELY DRESSED, TO SIT AND SMILE AND LOOK PRETTY,
AND SAY NOTHING, WAS ENOUGH FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THE PRESENT HOUR.
JANE FAIRFAX DID LOOK AND MOVE SUPERIOR; BUT EMMA SUSPECTED SHE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN GLAD TO CHANGE FEELINGS WITH HARRIET, VERY GLAD
TO HAVE PURCHASED THE MORTIFICATION OF HAVING LOVED--YES, OF HAVING
LOVED EVEN MR. ELTON IN VAIN--BY THE SURRENDER OF ALL THE DANGEROUS
PLEASURE OF KNOWING HERSELF BELOVED BY THE HUSBAND OF HER FRIEND.

IN SO LARGE A PARTY IT WAS NOT NECESSARY THAT EMMA SHOULD APPROACH HER.
SHE DID NOT WISH TO SPEAK OF THE PIANOFORTE, SHE FELT TOO MUCH
IN THE SECRET HERSELF, TO THINK THE APPEARANCE OF CURIOSITY
OR INTEREST FAIR, AND THEREFORE PURPOSELY KEPT AT A DISTANCE;
BUT BY THE OTHERS, THE SUBJECT WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY INTRODUCED,
AND SHE SAW THE BLUSH OF CONSCIOUSNESS WITH WHICH CONGRATULATIONS
WERE RECEIVED, THE BLUSH OF GUILT WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE NAME OF "MY
EXCELLENT FRIEND COLONEL CAMPBELL."

MRS. WESTON, KIND-HEARTED AND MUSICAL, WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED
BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE, AND EMMA COULD NOT HELP BEING AMUSED AT HER
PERSEVERANCE IN DWELLING ON THE SUBJECT; AND HAVING SO MUCH TO ASK
AND TO SAY AS TO TONE, TOUCH, AND PEDAL, TOTALLY UNSUSPICIOUS
OF THAT WISH OF SAYING AS LITTLE ABOUT IT AS POSSIBLE, WHICH SHE
PLAINLY READ IN THE FAIR HEROINE'S COUNTENANCE.

THEY WERE SOON JOINED BY SOME OF THE GENTLEMEN; AND THE VERY FIRST OF THE
EARLY WAS FRANK CHURCHILL.  IN HE WALKED, THE FIRST AND THE HANDSOMEST;
AND AFTER PAYING HIS COMPLIMENTS EN PASSANT TO MISS BATES AND
HER NIECE, MADE HIS WAY DIRECTLY TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CIRCLE,
WHERE SAT MISS WOODHOUSE; AND TILL HE COULD FIND A SEAT BY HER,
WOULD NOT SIT AT ALL.  EMMA DIVINED WHAT EVERY BODY PRESENT MUST
BE THINKING.  SHE WAS HIS OBJECT, AND EVERY BODY MUST PERCEIVE IT.
SHE INTRODUCED HIM TO HER FRIEND, MISS SMITH, AND, AT CONVENIENT
MOMENTS AFTERWARDS, HEARD WHAT EACH THOUGHT OF THE OTHER.  "HE HAD
NEVER SEEN SO LOVELY A FACE, AND WAS DELIGHTED WITH HER NAIVETE."
AND SHE, "ONLY TO BE SURE IT WAS PAYING HIM TOO GREAT A COMPLIMENT,
BUT SHE DID THINK THERE WERE SOME LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE MR. ELTON."
EMMA RESTRAINED HER INDIGNATION, AND ONLY TURNED FROM HER IN SILENCE.

SMILES OF INTELLIGENCE PASSED BETWEEN HER AND THE GENTLEMAN ON FIRST
GLANCING TOWARDS MISS FAIRFAX; BUT IT WAS MOST PRUDENT TO AVOID SPEECH.
HE TOLD HER THAT HE HAD BEEN IMPATIENT TO LEAVE THE DINING-ROOM--
HATED SITTING LONG--WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO MOVE WHEN HE COULD--
THAT HIS FATHER, MR. KNIGHTLEY, MR. COX, AND MR. COLE, WERE LEFT
VERY BUSY OVER PARISH BUSINESS--THAT AS LONG AS HE HAD STAID,
HOWEVER, IT HAD BEEN PLEASANT ENOUGH, AS HE HAD FOUND THEM IN GENERAL
A SET OF GENTLEMANLIKE, SENSIBLE MEN; AND SPOKE SO HANDSOMELY OF
HIGHBURY ALTOGETHER--THOUGHT IT SO ABUNDANT IN AGREEABLE FAMILIES--
THAT EMMA BEGAN TO FEEL SHE HAD BEEN USED TO DESPISE THE PLACE
RATHER TOO MUCH.  SHE QUESTIONED HIM AS TO THE SOCIETY IN YORKSHIRE--
THE EXTENT OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ABOUT ENSCOMBE, AND THE SORT;
AND COULD MAKE OUT FROM HIS ANSWERS THAT, AS FAR AS ENSCOMBE
WAS CONCERNED, THERE WAS VERY LITTLE GOING ON, THAT THEIR VISITINGS
WERE AMONG A RANGE OF GREAT FAMILIES, NONE VERY NEAR; AND THAT EVEN
WHEN DAYS WERE FIXED, AND INVITATIONS ACCEPTED, IT WAS AN EVEN
CHANCE THAT MRS. CHURCHILL WERE NOT IN HEALTH AND SPIRITS FOR GOING;
THAT THEY MADE A POINT OF VISITING NO FRESH PERSON; AND THAT,
THOUGH HE HAD HIS SEPARATE ENGAGEMENTS, IT WAS NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY,
WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE ADDRESS _AT_ _TIMES_, THAT HE COULD GET AWAY,
OR INTRODUCE AN ACQUAINTANCE FOR A NIGHT.

SHE SAW THAT ENSCOMBE COULD NOT SATISFY, AND THAT HIGHBURY,
TAKEN AT ITS BEST, MIGHT REASONABLY PLEASE A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD MORE
RETIREMENT AT HOME THAN HE LIKED.  HIS IMPORTANCE AT ENSCOMBE WAS
VERY EVIDENT.  HE DID NOT BOAST, BUT IT NATURALLY BETRAYED ITSELF,
THAT HE HAD PERSUADED HIS AUNT WHERE HIS UNCLE COULD DO NOTHING,
AND ON HER LAUGHING AND NOTICING IT, HE OWNED THAT HE BELIEVED (EXCEPTING
ONE OR TWO POINTS) HE COULD _WITH_ _TIME_ PERSUADE HER TO ANY THING.
ONE OF THOSE POINTS ON WHICH HIS INFLUENCE FAILED, HE THEN MENTIONED.
HE HAD WANTED VERY MUCH TO GO ABROAD--HAD BEEN VERY EAGER INDEED
TO BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL--BUT SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT.  THIS HAD
HAPPENED THE YEAR BEFORE.  _NOW_, HE SAID, HE WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE
NO LONGER THE SAME WISH.

THE UNPERSUADABLE POINT, WHICH HE DID NOT MENTION, EMMA GUESSED
TO BE GOOD BEHAVIOUR TO HIS FATHER.

"I HAVE MADE A MOST WRETCHED DISCOVERY," SAID HE, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE.--
"I HAVE BEEN HERE A WEEK TO-MORROW--HALF MY TIME.  I NEVER KNEW
DAYS FLY SO FAST.  A WEEK TO-MORROW!--AND I HAVE HARDLY BEGUN TO
ENJOY MYSELF.  BUT JUST GOT ACQUAINTED WITH MRS. WESTON, AND OTHERS!--
I HATE THE RECOLLECTION."

"PERHAPS YOU MAY NOW BEGIN TO REGRET THAT YOU SPENT ONE WHOLE DAY,
OUT OF SO FEW, IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT."

"NO," SAID HE, SMILING, "THAT IS NO SUBJECT OF REGRET AT ALL.
I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN SEEING MY FRIENDS, UNLESS I CAN BELIEVE MYSELF
FIT TO BE SEEN."

THE REST OF THE GENTLEMEN BEING NOW IN THE ROOM, EMMA FOUND HERSELF
OBLIGED TO TURN FROM HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND LISTEN TO MR. COLE.
WHEN MR. COLE HAD MOVED AWAY, AND HER ATTENTION COULD BE RESTORED
AS BEFORE, SHE SAW FRANK CHURCHILL LOOKING INTENTLY ACROSS THE ROOM
AT MISS FAIRFAX, WHO WAS SITTING EXACTLY OPPOSITE.

"WHAT IS THE MATTER?" SAID SHE.

HE STARTED.  "THANK YOU FOR ROUSING ME," HE REPLIED.  "I BELIEVE
I HAVE BEEN VERY RUDE; BUT REALLY MISS FAIRFAX HAS DONE HER HAIR
IN SO ODD A WAY--SO VERY ODD A WAY--THAT I CANNOT KEEP MY EYES
FROM HER.  I NEVER SAW ANY THING SO OUTREE!--THOSE CURLS!--THIS MUST
BE A FANCY OF HER OWN.  I SEE NOBODY ELSE LOOKING LIKE HER!--
I MUST GO AND ASK HER WHETHER IT IS AN IRISH FASHION.  SHALL I?--
YES, I WILL--I DECLARE I WILL--AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW SHE TAKES IT;--
WHETHER SHE COLOURS."

HE WAS GONE IMMEDIATELY; AND EMMA SOON SAW HIM STANDING BEFORE MISS
FAIRFAX, AND TALKING TO HER; BUT AS TO ITS EFFECT ON THE YOUNG LADY,
AS HE HAD IMPROVIDENTLY PLACED HIMSELF EXACTLY BETWEEN THEM, EXACTLY
IN FRONT OF MISS FAIRFAX, SHE COULD ABSOLUTELY DISTINGUISH NOTHING.

BEFORE HE COULD RETURN TO HIS CHAIR, IT WAS TAKEN BY MRS. WESTON.

"THIS IS THE LUXURY OF A LARGE PARTY," SAID SHE:--"ONE CAN GET
NEAR EVERY BODY, AND SAY EVERY THING.  MY DEAR EMMA, I AM LONGING
TO TALK TO YOU.  I HAVE BEEN MAKING DISCOVERIES AND FORMING PLANS,
JUST LIKE YOURSELF, AND I MUST TELL THEM WHILE THE IDEA IS FRESH.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MISS BATES AND HER NIECE CAME HERE?"

"HOW?--THEY WERE INVITED, WERE NOT THEY?"

"OH! YES--BUT HOW THEY WERE CONVEYED HITHER?--THE MANNER OF THEIR COMING?"

"THEY WALKED, I CONCLUDE.  HOW ELSE COULD THEY COME?"

"VERY TRUE.--WELL, A LITTLE WHILE AGO IT OCCURRED TO ME HOW VERY SAD
IT WOULD BE TO HAVE JANE FAIRFAX WALKING HOME AGAIN, LATE AT NIGHT,
AND COLD AS THE NIGHTS ARE NOW.  AND AS I LOOKED AT HER, THOUGH I
NEVER SAW HER APPEAR TO MORE ADVANTAGE, IT STRUCK ME THAT SHE
WAS HEATED, AND WOULD THEREFORE BE PARTICULARLY LIABLE TO TAKE COLD.
POOR GIRL!  I COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA OF IT; SO, AS SOON AS MR. WESTON
CAME INTO THE ROOM, AND I COULD GET AT HIM, I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT
THE CARRIAGE.  YOU MAY GUESS HOW READILY HE CAME INTO MY WISHES;
AND HAVING HIS APPROBATION, I MADE MY WAY DIRECTLY TO MISS BATES,
TO ASSURE HER THAT THE CARRIAGE WOULD BE AT HER SERVICE BEFORE IT TOOK
US HOME; FOR I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MAKING HER COMFORTABLE AT ONCE.
GOOD SOUL! SHE WAS AS GRATEFUL AS POSSIBLE, YOU MAY BE SURE.
`NOBODY WAS EVER SO FORTUNATE AS HERSELF!'--BUT WITH MANY,
MANY THANKS--`THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO TROUBLE US, FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY'S
CARRIAGE HAD BROUGHT, AND WAS TO TAKE THEM HOME AGAIN.'  I WAS
QUITE SURPRIZED;--VERY GLAD, I AM SURE; BUT REALLY QUITE SURPRIZED.
SUCH A VERY KIND ATTENTION--AND SO THOUGHTFUL AN ATTENTION!--
THE SORT OF THING THAT SO FEW MEN WOULD THINK OF.  AND, IN SHORT,
FROM KNOWING HIS USUAL WAYS, I AM VERY MUCH INCLINED TO THINK
THAT IT WAS FOR THEIR ACCOMMODATION THE CARRIAGE WAS USED AT ALL.
I DO SUSPECT HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A PAIR OF HORSES FOR HIMSELF,
AND THAT IT WAS ONLY AS AN EXCUSE FOR ASSISTING THEM."

"VERY LIKELY," SAID EMMA--"NOTHING MORE LIKELY.  I KNOW NO MAN
MORE LIKELY THAN MR. KNIGHTLEY TO DO THE SORT OF THING--TO DO ANY
THING REALLY GOOD-NATURED, USEFUL, CONSIDERATE, OR BENEVOLENT.
HE IS NOT A GALLANT MAN, BUT HE IS A VERY HUMANE ONE; AND THIS,
CONSIDERING JANE FAIRFAX'S ILL-HEALTH, WOULD APPEAR A CASE
OF HUMANITY TO HIM;--AND FOR AN ACT OF UNOSTENTATIOUS KINDNESS,
THERE IS NOBODY WHOM I WOULD FIX ON MORE THAN ON MR. KNIGHTLEY.
I KNOW HE HAD HORSES TO-DAY--FOR WE ARRIVED TOGETHER; AND I LAUGHED AT
HIM ABOUT IT, BUT HE SAID NOT A WORD THAT COULD BETRAY."

"WELL," SAID MRS. WESTON, SMILING, "YOU GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR
MORE SIMPLE, DISINTERESTED BENEVOLENCE IN THIS INSTANCE THAN I DO;
FOR WHILE MISS BATES WAS SPEAKING, A SUSPICION DARTED INTO MY HEAD,
AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET IT OUT AGAIN.  THE MORE I THINK
OF IT, THE MORE PROBABLE IT APPEARS.  IN SHORT, I HAVE MADE A MATCH
BETWEEN MR. KNIGHTLEY AND JANE FAIRFAX.  SEE THE CONSEQUENCE
OF KEEPING YOU COMPANY!--WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT?"

"MR. KNIGHTLEY AND JANE FAIRFAX!" EXCLAIMED EMMA.  "DEAR MRS. WESTON,
HOW COULD YOU THINK OF SUCH A THING?--MR. KNIGHTLEY!--MR. KNIGHTLEY
MUST NOT MARRY!--YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LITTLE HENRY CUT OUT FROM DONWELL?--
OH! NO, NO, HENRY MUST HAVE DONWELL.  I CANNOT AT ALL CONSENT TO
MR. KNIGHTLEY'S MARRYING; AND I AM SURE IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY.
I AM AMAZED THAT YOU SHOULD THINK OF SUCH A THING."

"MY DEAR EMMA, I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT LED ME TO THINK OF IT.
I DO NOT WANT THE MATCH--I DO NOT WANT TO INJURE DEAR LITTLE HENRY--
BUT THE IDEA HAS BEEN GIVEN ME BY CIRCUMSTANCES; AND IF MR. KNIGHTLEY
REALLY WISHED TO MARRY, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HIM REFRAIN ON HENRY'S
ACCOUNT, A BOY OF SIX YEARS OLD, WHO KNOWS NOTHING OF THE MATTER?"

"YES, I WOULD.  I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HENRY SUPPLANTED.--
MR. KNIGHTLEY MARRY!--NO, I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH AN IDEA, AND I
CANNOT ADOPT IT NOW.  AND JANE FAIRFAX, TOO, OF ALL WOMEN!"

"NAY, SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FIRST FAVOURITE WITH HIM, AS YOU
VERY WELL KNOW."

"BUT THE IMPRUDENCE OF SUCH A MATCH!"

"I AM NOT SPEAKING OF ITS PRUDENCE; MERELY ITS PROBABILITY."

"I SEE NO PROBABILITY IN IT, UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY BETTER FOUNDATION
THAN WHAT YOU MENTION.  HIS GOOD-NATURE, HIS HUMANITY, AS I TELL YOU,
WOULD BE QUITE ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HORSES.  HE HAS A GREAT
REGARD FOR THE BATESES, YOU KNOW, INDEPENDENT OF JANE FAIRFAX--
AND IS ALWAYS GLAD TO SHEW THEM ATTENTION.  MY DEAR MRS. WESTON,
DO NOT TAKE TO MATCH-MAKING.  YOU DO IT VERY ILL.  JANE FAIRFAX MISTRESS
OF THE ABBEY!--OH! NO, NO;--EVERY FEELING REVOLTS.  FOR HIS OWN SAKE,
I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM DO SO MAD A THING."

"IMPRUDENT, IF YOU PLEASE--BUT NOT MAD.  EXCEPTING INEQUALITY OF FORTUNE,
AND PERHAPS A LITTLE DISPARITY OF AGE, I CAN SEE NOTHING UNSUITABLE."

"BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY DOES NOT WANT TO MARRY.  I AM SURE HE HAS NOT THE
LEAST IDEA OF IT.  DO NOT PUT IT INTO HIS HEAD.  WHY SHOULD HE MARRY?--
HE IS AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE BY HIMSELF; WITH HIS FARM, AND HIS SHEEP,
AND HIS LIBRARY, AND ALL THE PARISH TO MANAGE; AND HE IS EXTREMELY
FOND OF HIS BROTHER'S CHILDREN.  HE HAS NO OCCASION TO MARRY,
EITHER TO FILL UP HIS TIME OR HIS HEART."

"MY DEAR EMMA, AS LONG AS HE THINKS SO, IT IS SO; BUT IF HE REALLY
LOVES JANE FAIRFAX--"

"NONSENSE!  HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT JANE FAIRFAX.  IN THE WAY
OF LOVE, I AM SURE HE DOES NOT.  HE WOULD DO ANY GOOD TO HER,
OR HER FAMILY; BUT--"

"WELL," SAID MRS. WESTON, LAUGHING, "PERHAPS THE GREATEST GOOD HE
COULD DO THEM, WOULD BE TO GIVE JANE SUCH A RESPECTABLE HOME."

"IF IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HER, I AM SURE IT WOULD BE EVIL TO HIMSELF;
A VERY SHAMEFUL AND DEGRADING CONNEXION.  HOW WOULD HE BEAR TO HAVE
MISS BATES BELONGING TO HIM?--TO HAVE HER HAUNTING THE ABBEY,
AND THANKING HIM ALL DAY LONG FOR HIS GREAT KINDNESS IN MARRYING JANE?--
`SO VERY KIND AND OBLIGING!--BUT HE ALWAYS HAD BEEN SUCH A VERY
KIND NEIGHBOUR!'  AND THEN FLY OFF, THROUGH HALF A SENTENCE,
TO HER MOTHER'S OLD PETTICOAT.  `NOT THAT IT WAS SUCH A VERY OLD
PETTICOAT EITHER--FOR STILL IT WOULD LAST A GREAT WHILE--AND, INDEED,
SHE MUST THANKFULLY SAY THAT THEIR PETTICOATS WERE ALL VERY STRONG.'"

"FOR SHAME, EMMA!  DO NOT MIMIC HER.  YOU DIVERT ME AGAINST
MY CONSCIENCE.  AND, UPON MY WORD, I DO NOT THINK MR. KNIGHTLEY WOULD
BE MUCH DISTURBED BY MISS BATES.  LITTLE THINGS DO NOT IRRITATE HIM.
SHE MIGHT TALK ON; AND IF HE WANTED TO SAY ANY THING HIMSELF, HE WOULD
ONLY TALK LOUDER, AND DROWN HER VOICE.  BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT,
WHETHER IT WOULD BE A BAD CONNEXION FOR HIM, BUT WHETHER HE WISHES IT;
AND I THINK HE DOES.  I HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAK, AND SO MUST YOU,
SO VERY HIGHLY OF JANE FAIRFAX!  THE INTEREST HE TAKES IN HER--
HIS ANXIETY ABOUT HER HEALTH--HIS CONCERN THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE NO
HAPPIER PROSPECT!  I HAVE HEARD HIM EXPRESS HIMSELF SO WARMLY ON
THOSE POINTS!--SUCH AN ADMIRER OF HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE,
AND OF HER VOICE!  I HAVE HEARD HIM SAY THAT HE COULD LISTEN TO HER
FOR EVER.  OH! AND I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN ONE IDEA THAT OCCURRED
TO ME--THIS PIANOFORTE THAT HAS BEEN SENT HERE BY SOMEBODY--
THOUGH WE HAVE ALL BEEN SO WELL SATISFIED TO CONSIDER IT A PRESENT
FROM THE CAMPBELLS, MAY IT NOT BE FROM MR. KNIGHTLEY?  I CANNOT
HELP SUSPECTING HIM.  I THINK HE IS JUST THE PERSON TO DO IT,
EVEN WITHOUT BEING IN LOVE."

"THEN IT CAN BE NO ARGUMENT TO PROVE THAT HE IS IN LOVE.
BUT I DO NOT THINK IT IS AT ALL A LIKELY THING FOR HIM TO DO.
MR. KNIGHTLEY DOES NOTHING MYSTERIOUSLY."

"I HAVE HEARD HIM LAMENTING HER HAVING NO INSTRUMENT REPEATEDLY;
OFTENER THAN I SHOULD SUPPOSE SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD, IN THE COMMON
COURSE OF THINGS, OCCUR TO HIM."

"VERY WELL; AND IF HE HAD INTENDED TO GIVE HER ONE, HE WOULD HAVE
TOLD HER SO."

"THERE MIGHT BE SCRUPLES OF DELICACY, MY DEAR EMMA.  I HAVE A VERY
STRONG NOTION THAT IT COMES FROM HIM.  I AM SURE HE WAS PARTICULARLY
SILENT WHEN MRS. COLE TOLD US OF IT AT DINNER."

"YOU TAKE UP AN IDEA, MRS. WESTON, AND RUN AWAY WITH IT; AS YOU HAVE
MANY A TIME REPROACHED ME WITH DOING.  I SEE NO SIGN OF ATTACHMENT--
I BELIEVE NOTHING OF THE PIANOFORTE--AND PROOF ONLY SHALL CONVINCE
ME THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY HAS ANY THOUGHT OF MARRYING JANE FAIRFAX."

THEY COMBATED THE POINT SOME TIME LONGER IN THE SAME WAY; EMMA RATHER
GAINING GROUND OVER THE MIND OF HER FRIEND; FOR MRS. WESTON WAS
THE MOST USED OF THE TWO TO YIELD; TILL A LITTLE BUSTLE IN THE ROOM
SHEWED THEM THAT TEA WAS OVER, AND THE INSTRUMENT IN PREPARATION;--
AND AT THE SAME MOMENT MR. COLE APPROACHING TO ENTREAT MISS WOODHOUSE
WOULD DO THEM THE HONOUR OF TRYING IT.  FRANK CHURCHILL, OF WHOM,
IN THE EAGERNESS OF HER CONVERSATION WITH MRS. WESTON, SHE HAD BEEN
SEEING NOTHING, EXCEPT THAT HE HAD FOUND A SEAT BY MISS FAIRFAX,
FOLLOWED MR. COLE, TO ADD HIS VERY PRESSING ENTREATIES; AND AS,
IN EVERY RESPECT, IT SUITED EMMA BEST TO LEAD, SHE GAVE A VERY
PROPER COMPLIANCE.

SHE KNEW THE LIMITATIONS OF HER OWN POWERS TOO WELL TO ATTEMPT
MORE THAN SHE COULD PERFORM WITH CREDIT; SHE WANTED NEITHER TASTE
NOR SPIRIT IN THE LITTLE THINGS WHICH ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE,
AND COULD ACCOMPANY HER OWN VOICE WELL.  ONE ACCOMPANIMENT TO HER SONG
TOOK HER AGREEABLY BY SURPRIZE--A SECOND, SLIGHTLY BUT CORRECTLY
TAKEN BY FRANK CHURCHILL.  HER PARDON WAS DULY BEGGED AT THE CLOSE
OF THE SONG, AND EVERY THING USUAL FOLLOWED.  HE WAS ACCUSED
OF HAVING A DELIGHTFUL VOICE, AND A PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC;
WHICH WAS PROPERLY DENIED; AND THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MATTER,
AND HAD NO VOICE AT ALL, ROUNDLY ASSERTED.  THEY SANG TOGETHER
ONCE MORE; AND EMMA WOULD THEN RESIGN HER PLACE TO MISS FAIRFAX,
WHOSE PERFORMANCE, BOTH VOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL, SHE NEVER COULD
ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL FROM HERSELF, WAS INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO HER OWN.

WITH MIXED FEELINGS, SHE SEATED HERSELF AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE
NUMBERS ROUND THE INSTRUMENT, TO LISTEN.  FRANK CHURCHILL SANG AGAIN.
THEY HAD SUNG TOGETHER ONCE OR TWICE, IT APPEARED, AT WEYMOUTH.
BUT THE SIGHT OF MR. KNIGHTLEY AMONG THE MOST ATTENTIVE, SOON DREW
AWAY HALF EMMA'S MIND; AND SHE FELL INTO A TRAIN OF THINKING
ON THE SUBJECT OF MRS. WESTON'S SUSPICIONS, TO WHICH THE SWEET
SOUNDS OF THE UNITED VOICES GAVE ONLY MOMENTARY INTERRUPTIONS.
HER OBJECTIONS TO MR. KNIGHTLEY'S MARRYING DID NOT IN THE LEAST SUBSIDE.
SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT EVIL IN IT.  IT WOULD BE A GREAT
DISAPPOINTMENT TO MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY; CONSEQUENTLY TO ISABELLA.
A REAL INJURY TO THE CHILDREN--A MOST MORTIFYING CHANGE,
AND MATERIAL LOSS TO THEM ALL;--A VERY GREAT DEDUCTION FROM HER
FATHER'S DAILY COMFORT--AND, AS TO HERSELF, SHE COULD NOT AT ALL
ENDURE THE IDEA OF JANE FAIRFAX AT DONWELL ABBEY.  A MRS. KNIGHTLEY
FOR THEM ALL TO GIVE WAY TO!--NO--MR. KNIGHTLEY MUST NEVER MARRY.
LITTLE HENRY MUST REMAIN THE HEIR OF DONWELL.

PRESENTLY MR. KNIGHTLEY LOOKED BACK, AND CAME AND SAT DOWN BY HER.
THEY TALKED AT FIRST ONLY OF THE PERFORMANCE.  HIS ADMIRATION
WAS CERTAINLY VERY WARM; YET SHE THOUGHT, BUT FOR MRS. WESTON,
IT WOULD NOT HAVE STRUCK HER.  AS A SORT OF TOUCHSTONE, HOWEVER,
SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HIS KINDNESS IN CONVEYING THE AUNT AND NIECE;
AND THOUGH HIS ANSWER WAS IN THE SPIRIT OF CUTTING THE MATTER SHORT,
SHE BELIEVED IT TO INDICATE ONLY HIS DISINCLINATION TO DWELL ON ANY
KINDNESS OF HIS OWN.

"I OFTEN FEEL CONCERN," SAID SHE, "THAT I DARE NOT MAKE OUR CARRIAGE
MORE USEFUL ON SUCH OCCASIONS.  IT IS NOT THAT I AM WITHOUT THE WISH;
BUT YOU KNOW HOW IMPOSSIBLE MY FATHER WOULD DEEM IT THAT JAMES
SHOULD PUT-TO FOR SUCH A PURPOSE."

"QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION, QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION," HE REPLIED;--
"BUT YOU MUST OFTEN WISH IT, I AM SURE."  AND HE SMILED WITH SUCH
SEEMING PLEASURE AT THE CONVICTION, THAT SHE MUST PROCEED ANOTHER STEP.

"THIS PRESENT FROM THE CAMPBELLS," SAID SHE--"THIS PIANOFORTE
IS VERY KINDLY GIVEN."

"YES," HE REPLIED, AND WITHOUT THE SMALLEST APPARENT EMBARRASSMENT.--
"BUT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER HAD THEY GIVEN HER NOTICE OF IT.
SURPRIZES ARE FOOLISH THINGS.  THE PLEASURE IS NOT ENHANCED, AND THE
INCONVENIENCE IS OFTEN CONSIDERABLE.  I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED BETTER
JUDGMENT IN COLONEL CAMPBELL."

FROM THAT MOMENT, EMMA COULD HAVE TAKEN HER OATH THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY
HAD HAD NO CONCERN IN GIVING THE INSTRUMENT.  BUT WHETHER HE
WERE ENTIRELY FREE FROM PECULIAR ATTACHMENT--WHETHER THERE
WERE NO ACTUAL PREFERENCE--REMAINED A LITTLE LONGER DOUBTFUL.
TOWARDS THE END OF JANE'S SECOND SONG, HER VOICE GREW THICK.

"THAT WILL DO," SAID HE, WHEN IT WAS FINISHED, THINKING ALOUD--
"YOU HAVE SUNG QUITE ENOUGH FOR ONE EVENING--NOW BE QUIET."

ANOTHER SONG, HOWEVER, WAS SOON BEGGED FOR.  "ONE MORE;--THEY WOULD
NOT FATIGUE MISS FAIRFAX ON ANY ACCOUNT, AND WOULD ONLY ASK FOR
ONE MORE."  AND FRANK CHURCHILL WAS HEARD TO SAY, "I THINK YOU COULD
MANAGE THIS WITHOUT EFFORT; THE FIRST PART IS SO VERY TRIFLING.
THE STRENGTH OF THE SONG FALLS ON THE SECOND."

MR. KNIGHTLEY GREW ANGRY.

"THAT FELLOW," SAID HE, INDIGNANTLY, "THINKS OF NOTHING BUT SHEWING
OFF HIS OWN VOICE.  THIS MUST NOT BE."  AND TOUCHING MISS BATES,
WHO AT THAT MOMENT PASSED NEAR--"MISS BATES, ARE YOU MAD, TO LET
YOUR NIECE SING HERSELF HOARSE IN THIS MANNER?  GO, AND INTERFERE.
THEY HAVE NO MERCY ON HER."

MISS BATES, IN HER REAL ANXIETY FOR JANE, COULD HARDLY STAY EVEN
TO BE GRATEFUL, BEFORE SHE STEPT FORWARD AND PUT AN END TO ALL
FARTHER SINGING.  HERE CEASED THE CONCERT PART OF THE EVENING,
FOR MISS WOODHOUSE AND MISS FAIRFAX WERE THE ONLY YOUNG LADY PERFORMERS;
BUT SOON (WITHIN FIVE MINUTES) THE PROPOSAL OF DANCING--
ORIGINATING NOBODY EXACTLY KNEW WHERE--WAS SO EFFECTUALLY PROMOTED
BY MR. AND MRS. COLE, THAT EVERY THING WAS RAPIDLY CLEARING AWAY,
TO GIVE PROPER SPACE.  MRS. WESTON, CAPITAL IN HER COUNTRY-DANCES,
WAS SEATED, AND BEGINNING AN IRRESISTIBLE WALTZ; AND FRANK CHURCHILL,
COMING UP WITH MOST BECOMING GALLANTRY TO EMMA, HAD SECURED HER HAND,
AND LED HER UP TO THE TOP.

WHILE WAITING TILL THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE COULD PAIR THEMSELVES OFF,
EMMA FOUND TIME, IN SPITE OF THE COMPLIMENTS SHE WAS RECEIVING ON HER
VOICE AND HER TASTE, TO LOOK ABOUT, AND SEE WHAT BECAME OF MR. KNIGHTLEY.
THIS WOULD BE A TRIAL.  HE WAS NO DANCER IN GENERAL.  IF HE WERE TO BE
VERY ALERT IN ENGAGING JANE FAIRFAX NOW, IT MIGHT AUGUR SOMETHING.
THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE APPEARANCE.  NO; HE WAS TALKING TO MRS. COLE--
HE WAS LOOKING ON UNCONCERNED; JANE WAS ASKED BY SOMEBODY ELSE,
AND HE WAS STILL TALKING TO MRS. COLE.

EMMA HAD NO LONGER AN ALARM FOR HENRY; HIS INTEREST WAS YET SAFE;
AND SHE LED OFF THE DANCE WITH GENUINE SPIRIT AND ENJOYMENT.
NOT MORE THAN FIVE COUPLE COULD BE MUSTERED; BUT THE RARITY AND THE
SUDDENNESS OF IT MADE IT VERY DELIGHTFUL, AND SHE FOUND HERSELF WELL
MATCHED IN A PARTNER.  THEY WERE A COUPLE WORTH LOOKING AT.

TWO DANCES, UNFORTUNATELY, WERE ALL THAT COULD BE ALLOWED.
IT WAS GROWING LATE, AND MISS BATES BECAME ANXIOUS TO GET HOME,
ON HER MOTHER'S ACCOUNT.  AFTER SOME ATTEMPTS, THEREFORE, TO BE
PERMITTED TO BEGIN AGAIN, THEY WERE OBLIGED TO THANK MRS. WESTON,
LOOK SORROWFUL, AND HAVE DONE.

"PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, AS HE ATTENDED EMMA
TO HER CARRIAGE.  "I MUST HAVE ASKED MISS FAIRFAX, AND HER LANGUID
DANCING WOULD NOT HAVE AGREED WITH ME, AFTER YOUR'S."



CHAPTER IX


EMMA DID NOT REPENT HER CONDESCENSION IN GOING TO THE COLES.
THE VISIT AFFORDED HER MANY PLEASANT RECOLLECTIONS THE NEXT DAY;
AND ALL THAT SHE MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE LOST ON THE SIDE
OF DIGNIFIED SECLUSION, MUST BE AMPLY REPAID IN THE SPLENDOUR
OF POPULARITY.  SHE MUST HAVE DELIGHTED THE COLES--WORTHY PEOPLE,
WHO DESERVED TO BE MADE HAPPY!--AND LEFT A NAME BEHIND HER THAT WOULD
NOT SOON DIE AWAY.

PERFECT HAPPINESS, EVEN IN MEMORY, IS NOT COMMON; AND THERE WERE
TWO POINTS ON WHICH SHE WAS NOT QUITE EASY.  SHE DOUBTED WHETHER
SHE HAD NOT TRANSGRESSED THE DUTY OF WOMAN BY WOMAN, IN BETRAYING
HER SUSPICIONS OF JANE FAIRFAX'S FEELINGS TO FRANK CHURCHILL.
IT WAS HARDLY RIGHT; BUT IT HAD BEEN SO STRONG AN IDEA, THAT IT
WOULD ESCAPE HER, AND HIS SUBMISSION TO ALL THAT SHE TOLD,
WAS A COMPLIMENT TO HER PENETRATION, WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT
FOR HER TO BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HELD HER TONGUE.

THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF REGRET RELATED ALSO TO JANE FAIRFAX;
AND THERE SHE HAD NO DOUBT.  SHE DID UNFEIGNEDLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY
REGRET THE INFERIORITY OF HER OWN PLAYING AND SINGING.  SHE DID
MOST HEARTILY GRIEVE OVER THE IDLENESS OF HER CHILDHOOD--AND SAT
DOWN AND PRACTISED VIGOROUSLY AN HOUR AND A HALF.

SHE WAS THEN INTERRUPTED BY HARRIET'S COMING IN; AND IF HARRIET'S
PRAISE COULD HAVE SATISFIED HER, SHE MIGHT SOON HAVE BEEN COMFORTED.

"OH! IF I COULD BUT PLAY AS WELL AS YOU AND MISS FAIRFAX!"

"DON'T CLASS US TOGETHER, HARRIET.  MY PLAYING IS NO MORE LIKE
HER'S, THAN A LAMP IS LIKE SUNSHINE."

"OH! DEAR--I THINK YOU PLAY THE BEST OF THE TWO.  I THINK YOU PLAY
QUITE AS WELL AS SHE DOES.  I AM SURE I HAD MUCH RATHER HEAR YOU.
EVERY BODY LAST NIGHT SAID HOW WELL YOU PLAYED."

"THOSE WHO KNEW ANY THING ABOUT IT, MUST HAVE FELT THE DIFFERENCE.
THE TRUTH IS, HARRIET, THAT MY PLAYING IS JUST GOOD ENOUGH TO BE PRAISED,
BUT JANE FAIRFAX'S IS MUCH BEYOND IT."

"WELL, I ALWAYS SHALL THINK THAT YOU PLAY QUITE AS WELL AS SHE DOES,
OR THAT IF THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE NOBODY WOULD EVER FIND IT OUT.
MR. COLE SAID HOW MUCH TASTE YOU HAD; AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL TALKED
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOUR TASTE, AND THAT HE VALUED TASTE MUCH MORE
THAN EXECUTION."

"AH! BUT JANE FAIRFAX HAS THEM BOTH, HARRIET."

"ARE YOU SURE?  I SAW SHE HAD EXECUTION, BUT I DID NOT KNOW SHE HAD
ANY TASTE.  NOBODY TALKED ABOUT IT.  AND I HATE ITALIAN SINGING.--
THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING A WORD OF IT.  BESIDES, IF SHE DOES PLAY
SO VERY WELL, YOU KNOW, IT IS NO MORE THAN SHE IS OBLIGED TO DO,
BECAUSE SHE WILL HAVE TO TEACH.  THE COXES WERE WONDERING LAST NIGHT
WHETHER SHE WOULD GET INTO ANY GREAT FAMILY.  HOW DID YOU THINK THE
COXES LOOKED?"

"JUST AS THEY ALWAYS DO--VERY VULGAR."

"THEY TOLD ME SOMETHING," SAID HARRIET RATHER HESITATINGLY;"
BUT IT IS NOTHING OF ANY CONSEQUENCE."

EMMA WAS OBLIGED TO ASK WHAT THEY HAD TOLD HER, THOUGH FEARFUL
OF ITS PRODUCING MR. ELTON.

"THEY TOLD ME--THAT MR. MARTIN DINED WITH THEM LAST SATURDAY."

"OH!"

"HE CAME TO THEIR FATHER UPON SOME BUSINESS, AND HE ASKED HIM
TO STAY TO DINNER."

"OH!"

"THEY TALKED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HIM, ESPECIALLY ANNE COX.
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT, BUT SHE ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT I
SHOULD GO AND STAY THERE AGAIN NEXT SUMMER."

"SHE MEANT TO BE IMPERTINENTLY CURIOUS, JUST AS SUCH AN ANNE COX
SHOULD BE."

"SHE SAID HE WAS VERY AGREEABLE THE DAY HE DINED THERE.  HE SAT
BY HER AT DINNER.  MISS NASH THINKS EITHER OF THE COXES WOULD
BE VERY GLAD TO MARRY HIM."

"VERY LIKELY.--I THINK THEY ARE, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE MOST VULGAR
GIRLS IN HIGHBURY."

HARRIET HAD BUSINESS AT FORD'S.--EMMA THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO GO
WITH HER.  ANOTHER ACCIDENTAL MEETING WITH THE MARTINS WAS POSSIBLE,
AND IN HER PRESENT STATE, WOULD BE DANGEROUS.

HARRIET, TEMPTED BY EVERY THING AND SWAYED BY HALF A WORD, WAS ALWAYS
VERY LONG AT A PURCHASE; AND WHILE SHE WAS STILL HANGING OVER MUSLINS
AND CHANGING HER MIND, EMMA WENT TO THE DOOR FOR AMUSEMENT.--MUCH COULD
NOT BE HOPED FROM THE TRAFFIC OF EVEN THE BUSIEST PART OF HIGHBURY;--
MR. PERRY WALKING HASTILY BY, MR. WILLIAM COX LETTING HIMSELF IN AT
THE OFFICE-DOOR, MR. COLE'S CARRIAGE-HORSES RETURNING FROM EXERCISE,
OR A STRAY LETTER-BOY ON AN OBSTINATE MULE, WERE THE LIVELIEST
OBJECTS SHE COULD PRESUME TO EXPECT; AND WHEN HER EYES FELL ONLY ON
THE BUTCHER WITH HIS TRAY, A TIDY OLD WOMAN TRAVELLING HOMEWARDS FROM
SHOP WITH HER FULL BASKET, TWO CURS QUARRELLING OVER A DIRTY BONE,
AND A STRING OF DAWDLING CHILDREN ROUND THE BAKER'S LITTLE BOW-WINDOW
EYEING THE GINGERBREAD, SHE KNEW SHE HAD NO REASON TO COMPLAIN,
AND WAS AMUSED ENOUGH; QUITE ENOUGH STILL TO STAND AT THE DOOR.
A MIND LIVELY AND AT EASE, CAN DO WITH SEEING NOTHING, AND CAN SEE
NOTHING THAT DOES NOT ANSWER.

SHE LOOKED DOWN THE RANDALLS ROAD.  THE SCENE ENLARGED;
TWO PERSONS APPEARED; MRS. WESTON AND HER SON-IN-LAW; THEY WERE
WALKING INTO HIGHBURY;--TO HARTFIELD OF COURSE.  THEY WERE STOPPING,
HOWEVER, IN THE FIRST PLACE AT MRS. BATES'S; WHOSE HOUSE WAS
A LITTLE NEARER RANDALLS THAN FORD'S; AND HAD ALL BUT KNOCKED,
WHEN EMMA CAUGHT THEIR EYE.--IMMEDIATELY THEY CROSSED THE ROAD
AND CAME FORWARD TO HER; AND THE AGREEABLENESS OF YESTERDAY'S
ENGAGEMENT SEEMED TO GIVE FRESH PLEASURE TO THE PRESENT MEETING.
MRS. WESTON INFORMED HER THAT SHE WAS GOING TO CALL ON THE BATESES,
IN ORDER TO HEAR THE NEW INSTRUMENT.

"FOR MY COMPANION TELLS ME," SAID SHE, "THAT I ABSOLUTELY PROMISED
MISS BATES LAST NIGHT, THAT I WOULD COME THIS MORNING.  I WAS
NOT AWARE OF IT MYSELF.  I DID NOT KNOW THAT I HAD FIXED A DAY,
BUT AS HE SAYS I DID, I AM GOING NOW."

"AND WHILE MRS. WESTON PAYS HER VISIT, I MAY BE ALLOWED, I HOPE,"
SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, "TO JOIN YOUR PARTY AND WAIT FOR HER AT HARTFIELD--
IF YOU ARE GOING HOME."

MRS. WESTON WAS DISAPPOINTED.

"I THOUGHT YOU MEANT TO GO WITH ME.  THEY WOULD BE VERY MUCH PLEASED."

"ME!  I SHOULD BE QUITE IN THE WAY.  BUT, PERHAPS--I MAY BE EQUALLY
IN THE WAY HERE.  MISS WOODHOUSE LOOKS AS IF SHE DID NOT WANT ME.
MY AUNT ALWAYS SENDS ME OFF WHEN SHE IS SHOPPING.  SHE SAYS I FIDGET
HER TO DEATH; AND MISS WOODHOUSE LOOKS AS IF SHE COULD ALMOST SAY
THE SAME.  WHAT AM I TO DO?"

"I AM HERE ON NO BUSINESS OF MY OWN," SAID EMMA; "I AM ONLY WAITING
FOR MY FRIEND.  SHE WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOON DONE, AND THEN WE
SHALL GO HOME.  BUT YOU HAD BETTER GO WITH MRS. WESTON AND HEAR
THE INSTRUMENT."

"WELL--IF YOU ADVISE IT.--BUT (WITH A SMILE) IF COLONEL CAMPBELL
SHOULD HAVE EMPLOYED A CARELESS FRIEND, AND IF IT SHOULD PROVE
TO HAVE AN INDIFFERENT TONE--WHAT SHALL I SAY?  I SHALL BE NO
SUPPORT TO MRS. WESTON.  SHE MIGHT DO VERY WELL BY HERSELF.
A DISAGREEABLE TRUTH WOULD BE PALATABLE THROUGH HER LIPS, BUT I
AM THE WRETCHEDEST BEING IN THE WORLD AT A CIVIL FALSEHOOD."

"I DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH THING," REPLIED EMMA.--"I AM PERSUADED
THAT YOU CAN BE AS INSINCERE AS YOUR NEIGHBOURS, WHEN IT IS NECESSARY;
BUT THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THE INSTRUMENT IS INDIFFERENT.
QUITE OTHERWISE INDEED, IF I UNDERSTOOD MISS FAIRFAX'S OPINION
LAST NIGHT."

"DO COME WITH ME," SAID MRS. WESTON, "IF IT BE NOT VERY DISAGREEABLE
TO YOU.  IT NEED NOT DETAIN US LONG.  WE WILL GO TO HARTFIELD AFTERWARDS.
WE WILL FOLLOW THEM TO HARTFIELD.  I REALLY WISH YOU TO CALL WITH ME.
IT WILL BE FELT SO GREAT AN ATTENTION! AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU
MEANT IT."

HE COULD SAY NO MORE; AND WITH THE HOPE OF HARTFIELD TO REWARD HIM,
RETURNED WITH MRS. WESTON TO MRS. BATES'S DOOR.  EMMA WATCHED THEM IN,
AND THEN JOINED HARRIET AT THE INTERESTING COUNTER,--TRYING, WITH ALL
THE FORCE OF HER OWN MIND, TO CONVINCE HER THAT IF SHE WANTED PLAIN
MUSLIN IT WAS OF NO USE TO LOOK AT FIGURED; AND THAT A BLUE RIBBON,
BE IT EVER SO BEAUTIFUL, WOULD STILL NEVER MATCH HER YELLOW PATTERN.
AT LAST IT WAS ALL SETTLED, EVEN TO THE DESTINATION OF THE PARCEL.

"SHOULD I SEND IT TO MRS. GODDARD'S, MA'AM?" ASKED MRS. FORD.--
"YES--NO--YES, TO MRS. GODDARD'S. ONLY MY PATTERN GOWN IS
AT HARTFIELD.  NO, YOU SHALL SEND IT TO HARTFIELD, IF YOU PLEASE.
BUT THEN, MRS. GODDARD WILL WANT TO SEE IT.--AND I COULD TAKE THE
PATTERN GOWN HOME ANY DAY.  BUT I SHALL WANT THE RIBBON DIRECTLY--
SO IT HAD BETTER GO TO HARTFIELD--AT LEAST THE RIBBON.  YOU COULD
MAKE IT INTO TWO PARCELS, MRS. FORD, COULD NOT YOU?"

"IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE, HARRIET, TO GIVE MRS. FORD THE TROUBLE
OF TWO PARCELS."

"NO MORE IT IS."

"NO TROUBLE IN THE WORLD, MA'AM," SAID THE OBLIGING MRS. FORD.

"OH! BUT INDEED I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE IT ONLY IN ONE.
THEN, IF YOU PLEASE, YOU SHALL SEND IT ALL TO MRS. GODDARD'S--
I DO NOT KNOW--NO, I THINK, MISS WOODHOUSE, I MAY JUST AS WELL
HAVE IT SENT TO HARTFIELD, AND TAKE IT HOME WITH ME AT NIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU ADVISE?"

"THAT YOU DO NOT GIVE ANOTHER HALF-SECOND TO THE SUBJECT.
TO HARTFIELD, IF YOU PLEASE, MRS. FORD."

"AYE, THAT WILL BE MUCH BEST," SAID HARRIET, QUITE SATISFIED,
"I SHOULD NOT AT ALL LIKE TO HAVE IT SENT TO MRS. GODDARD'S."

VOICES APPROACHED THE SHOP--OR RATHER ONE VOICE AND TWO LADIES:
MRS. WESTON AND MISS BATES MET THEM AT THE DOOR.

"MY DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE," SAID THE LATTER, "I AM JUST RUN ACROSS TO
ENTREAT THE FAVOUR OF YOU TO COME AND SIT DOWN WITH US A LITTLE WHILE,
AND GIVE US YOUR OPINION OF OUR NEW INSTRUMENT; YOU AND MISS SMITH.
HOW DO YOU DO, MISS SMITH?--VERY WELL I THANK YOU.--AND I BEGGED
MRS. WESTON TO COME WITH ME, THAT I MIGHT BE SURE OF SUCCEEDING."

"I HOPE MRS. BATES AND MISS FAIRFAX ARE--"

"VERY WELL, I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU.  MY MOTHER IS DELIGHTFULLY WELL;
AND JANE CAUGHT NO COLD LAST NIGHT.  HOW IS MR. WOODHOUSE?--I AM SO GLAD
TO HEAR SUCH A GOOD ACCOUNT.  MRS. WESTON TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE.--
OH! THEN, SAID I, I MUST RUN ACROSS, I AM SURE MISS WOODHOUSE WILL
ALLOW ME JUST TO RUN ACROSS AND ENTREAT HER TO COME IN; MY MOTHER
WILL BE SO VERY HAPPY TO SEE HER--AND NOW WE ARE SUCH A NICE PARTY,
SHE CANNOT REFUSE.--`AYE, PRAY DO,' SAID MR. FRANK CHURCHILL,
`MISS WOODHOUSE'S OPINION OF THE INSTRUMENT WILL BE WORTH HAVING.'--
BUT, SAID I, I SHALL BE MORE SURE OF SUCCEEDING IF ONE OF YOU WILL GO
WITH ME.--`OH,' SAID HE, `WAIT HALF A MINUTE, TILL I HAVE FINISHED
MY JOB;'--FOR, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, MISS WOODHOUSE, THERE HE IS,
IN THE MOST OBLIGING MANNER IN THE WORLD, FASTENING IN THE RIVET OF MY
MOTHER'S SPECTACLES.--THE RIVET CAME OUT, YOU KNOW, THIS MORNING.--
SO VERY OBLIGING!--FOR MY MOTHER HAD NO USE OF HER SPECTACLES--
COULD NOT PUT THEM ON.  AND, BY THE BYE, EVERY BODY OUGHT TO HAVE
TWO PAIR OF SPECTACLES; THEY SHOULD INDEED.  JANE SAID SO.
I MEANT TO TAKE THEM OVER TO JOHN SAUNDERS THE FIRST THING I DID,
BUT SOMETHING OR OTHER HINDERED ME ALL THE MORNING; FIRST ONE THING,
THEN ANOTHER, THERE IS NO SAYING WHAT, YOU KNOW.  AT ONE TIME PATTY CAME
TO SAY SHE THOUGHT THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY WANTED SWEEPING.  OH, SAID I,
PATTY DO NOT COME WITH YOUR BAD NEWS TO ME.  HERE IS THE RIVET
OF YOUR MISTRESS'S SPECTACLES OUT.  THEN THE BAKED APPLES CAME HOME,
MRS. WALLIS SENT THEM BY HER BOY; THEY ARE EXTREMELY CIVIL AND
OBLIGING TO US, THE WALLISES, ALWAYS--I HAVE HEARD SOME PEOPLE
SAY THAT MRS. WALLIS CAN BE UNCIVIL AND GIVE A VERY RUDE ANSWER,
BUT WE HAVE NEVER KNOWN ANY THING BUT THE GREATEST ATTENTION
FROM THEM.  AND IT CANNOT BE FOR THE VALUE OF OUR CUSTOM NOW,
FOR WHAT IS OUR CONSUMPTION OF BREAD, YOU KNOW?  ONLY THREE OF US.--
BESIDES DEAR JANE AT PRESENT--AND SHE REALLY EATS NOTHING--MAKES SUCH
A SHOCKING BREAKFAST, YOU WOULD BE QUITE FRIGHTENED IF YOU SAW IT.
I DARE NOT LET MY MOTHER KNOW HOW LITTLE SHE EATS--SO I SAY ONE
THING AND THEN I SAY ANOTHER, AND IT PASSES OFF.  BUT ABOUT THE
MIDDLE OF THE DAY SHE GETS HUNGRY, AND THERE IS NOTHING SHE LIKES
SO WELL AS THESE BAKED APPLES, AND THEY ARE EXTREMELY WHOLESOME,
FOR I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY THE OTHER DAY OF ASKING MR. PERRY;
I HAPPENED TO MEET HIM IN THE STREET.  NOT THAT I HAD ANY DOUBT BEFORE--
I HAVE SO OFTEN HEARD MR. WOODHOUSE RECOMMEND A BAKED APPLE.
I BELIEVE IT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT MR. WOODHOUSE THINKS THE
FRUIT THOROUGHLY WHOLESOME.  WE HAVE APPLE-DUMPLINGS, HOWEVER,
VERY OFTEN.  PATTY MAKES AN EXCELLENT APPLE-DUMPLING. WELL,
MRS. WESTON, YOU HAVE PREVAILED, I HOPE, AND THESE LADIES WILL
OBLIGE US."

EMMA WOULD BE "VERY HAPPY TO WAIT ON MRS. BATES, &C.," AND THEY
DID AT LAST MOVE OUT OF THE SHOP, WITH NO FARTHER DELAY FROM MISS
BATES THAN,

"HOW DO YOU DO, MRS. FORD?  I BEG YOUR PARDON.  I DID NOT SEE
YOU BEFORE.  I HEAR YOU HAVE A CHARMING COLLECTION OF NEW RIBBONS
FROM TOWN.  JANE CAME BACK DELIGHTED YESTERDAY.  THANK YE,
THE GLOVES DO VERY WELL--ONLY A LITTLE TOO LARGE ABOUT THE WRIST;
BUT JANE IS TAKING THEM IN."

"WHAT WAS I TALKING OF?" SAID SHE, BEGINNING AGAIN WHEN THEY WERE
ALL IN THE STREET.

EMMA WONDERED ON WHAT, OF ALL THE MEDLEY, SHE WOULD FIX.

"I DECLARE I CANNOT RECOLLECT WHAT I WAS TALKING OF.--OH! MY
MOTHER'S SPECTACLES.  SO VERY OBLIGING OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL!
`OH!' SAID HE, `I DO THINK I CAN FASTEN THE RIVET; I LIKE A JOB
OF THIS KIND EXCESSIVELY.'--WHICH YOU KNOW SHEWED HIM TO BE SO
VERY. . . . INDEED I MUST SAY THAT, MUCH AS I HAD HEARD OF HIM
BEFORE AND MUCH AS I HAD EXPECTED, HE VERY FAR EXCEEDS ANY
THING. . . . I DO CONGRATULATE YOU, MRS. WESTON, MOST WARMLY.
HE SEEMS EVERY THING THE FONDEST PARENT COULD. . . . `OH!' SAID HE,
`I CAN FASTEN THE RIVET.  I LIKE A JOB OF THAT SORT EXCESSIVELY.'
I NEVER SHALL FORGET HIS MANNER.  AND WHEN I BROUGHT OUT THE BAKED
APPLES FROM THE CLOSET, AND HOPED OUR FRIENDS WOULD BE SO VERY
OBLIGING AS TO TAKE SOME, `OH!' SAID HE DIRECTLY, `THERE IS NOTHING
IN THE WAY OF FRUIT HALF SO GOOD, AND THESE ARE THE FINEST-LOOKING
HOME-BAKED APPLES I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE.'  THAT, YOU KNOW, WAS SO
VERY. . . . AND I AM SURE, BY HIS MANNER, IT WAS NO COMPLIMENT.
INDEED THEY ARE VERY DELIGHTFUL APPLES, AND MRS. WALLIS DOES THEM
FULL JUSTICE--ONLY WE DO NOT HAVE THEM BAKED MORE THAN TWICE,
AND MR. WOODHOUSE MADE US PROMISE TO HAVE THEM DONE THREE TIMES--
BUT MISS WOODHOUSE WILL BE SO GOOD AS NOT TO MENTION IT.  THE APPLES
THEMSELVES ARE THE VERY FINEST SORT FOR BAKING, BEYOND A DOUBT;
ALL FROM DONWELL--SOME OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S MOST LIBERAL SUPPLY.
HE SENDS US A SACK EVERY YEAR; AND CERTAINLY THERE NEVER WAS SUCH
A KEEPING APPLE ANYWHERE AS ONE OF HIS TREES--I BELIEVE THERE
IS TWO OF THEM.  MY MOTHER SAYS THE ORCHARD WAS ALWAYS FAMOUS
IN HER YOUNGER DAYS.  BUT I WAS REALLY QUITE SHOCKED THE OTHER DAY--
FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY CALLED ONE MORNING, AND JANE WAS EATING THESE APPLES,
AND WE TALKED ABOUT THEM AND SAID HOW MUCH SHE ENJOYED THEM,
AND HE ASKED WHETHER WE WERE NOT GOT TO THE END OF OUR STOCK.
`I AM SURE YOU MUST BE,' SAID HE, `AND I WILL SEND YOU
ANOTHER SUPPLY; FOR I HAVE A GREAT MANY MORE THAN I CAN EVER USE.
WILLIAM LARKINS LET ME KEEP A LARGER QUANTITY THAN USUAL THIS YEAR.
I WILL SEND YOU SOME MORE, BEFORE THEY GET GOOD FOR NOTHING.'
SO I BEGGED HE WOULD NOT--FOR REALLY AS TO OURS BEING GONE, I COULD
NOT ABSOLUTELY SAY THAT WE HAD A GREAT MANY LEFT--IT WAS BUT HALF
A DOZEN INDEED; BUT THEY SHOULD BE ALL KEPT FOR JANE; AND I COULD
NOT AT ALL BEAR THAT HE SHOULD BE SENDING US MORE, SO LIBERAL AS HE
HAD BEEN ALREADY; AND JANE SAID THE SAME.  AND WHEN HE WAS GONE,
SHE ALMOST QUARRELLED WITH ME--NO, I SHOULD NOT SAY QUARRELLED,
FOR WE NEVER HAD A QUARREL IN OUR LIVES; BUT SHE WAS QUITE DISTRESSED
THAT I HAD OWNED THE APPLES WERE SO NEARLY GONE; SHE WISHED I HAD
MADE HIM BELIEVE WE HAD A GREAT MANY LEFT.  OH, SAID I, MY DEAR,
I DID SAY AS MUCH AS I COULD.  HOWEVER, THE VERY SAME EVENING
WILLIAM LARKINS CAME OVER WITH A LARGE BASKET OF APPLES, THE SAME
SORT OF APPLES, A BUSHEL AT LEAST, AND I WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED,
AND WENT DOWN AND SPOKE TO WILLIAM LARKINS AND SAID EVERY THING,
AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE.  WILLIAM LARKINS IS SUCH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE!
I AM ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE HIM.  BUT, HOWEVER, I FOUND AFTERWARDS
FROM PATTY, THAT WILLIAM SAID IT WAS ALL THE APPLES OF _THAT_ SORT
HIS MASTER HAD; HE HAD BROUGHT THEM ALL--AND NOW HIS MASTER HAD NOT
ONE LEFT TO BAKE OR BOIL.  WILLIAM DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT HIMSELF,
HE WAS SO PLEASED TO THINK HIS MASTER HAD SOLD SO MANY; FOR WILLIAM,
YOU KNOW, THINKS MORE OF HIS MASTER'S PROFIT THAN ANY THING;
BUT MRS. HODGES, HE SAID, WAS QUITE DISPLEASED AT THEIR BEING
ALL SENT AWAY.  SHE COULD NOT BEAR THAT HER MASTER SHOULD NOT BE
ABLE TO HAVE ANOTHER APPLE-TART THIS SPRING.  HE TOLD PATTY THIS,
BUT BID HER NOT MIND IT, AND BE SURE NOT TO SAY ANY THING TO US
ABOUT IT, FOR MRS. HODGES _WOULD_ BE CROSS SOMETIMES, AND AS LONG AS
SO MANY SACKS WERE SOLD, IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHO ATE THE REMAINDER.
AND SO PATTY TOLD ME, AND I WAS EXCESSIVELY SHOCKED INDEED!
I WOULD NOT HAVE MR. KNIGHTLEY KNOW ANY THING ABOUT IT FOR
THE WORLD!  HE WOULD BE SO VERY. . . . I WANTED TO KEEP IT FROM
JANE'S KNOWLEDGE; BUT, UNLUCKILY, I HAD MENTIONED IT BEFORE I WAS
AWARE."

MISS BATES HAD JUST DONE AS PATTY OPENED THE DOOR; AND HER VISITORS
WALKED UPSTAIRS WITHOUT HAVING ANY REGULAR NARRATION TO ATTEND TO,
PURSUED ONLY BY THE SOUNDS OF HER DESULTORY GOOD-WILL.

"PRAY TAKE CARE, MRS. WESTON, THERE IS A STEP AT THE TURNING.
PRAY TAKE CARE, MISS WOODHOUSE, OURS IS RATHER A DARK STAIRCASE--
RATHER DARKER AND NARROWER THAN ONE COULD WISH.  MISS SMITH,
PRAY TAKE CARE.  MISS WOODHOUSE, I AM QUITE CONCERNED, I AM SURE YOU
HIT YOUR FOOT.  MISS SMITH, THE STEP AT THE TURNING."



CHAPTER X


THE APPEARANCE OF THE LITTLE SITTING-ROOM AS THEY ENTERED,
WAS TRANQUILLITY ITSELF; MRS. BATES, DEPRIVED OF HER USUAL EMPLOYMENT,
SLUMBERING ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIRE, FRANK CHURCHILL, AT A TABLE
NEAR HER, MOST DEEDILY OCCUPIED ABOUT HER SPECTACLES, AND JANE FAIRFAX,
STANDING WITH HER BACK TO THEM, INTENT ON HER PIANOFORTE.

BUSY AS HE WAS, HOWEVER, THE YOUNG MAN WAS YET ABLE TO SHEW A MOST
HAPPY COUNTENANCE ON SEEING EMMA AGAIN.

"THIS IS A PLEASURE," SAID HE, IN RATHER A LOW VOICE, "COMING AT
LEAST TEN MINUTES EARLIER THAN I HAD CALCULATED.  YOU FIND ME
TRYING TO BE USEFUL; TELL ME IF YOU THINK I SHALL SUCCEED."

"WHAT!" SAID MRS. WESTON, "HAVE NOT YOU FINISHED IT YET? YOU WOULD
NOT EARN A VERY GOOD LIVELIHOOD AS A WORKING SILVERSMITH AT THIS RATE."

"I HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING UNINTERRUPTEDLY," HE REPLIED, "I HAVE BEEN
ASSISTING MISS FAIRFAX IN TRYING TO MAKE HER INSTRUMENT STAND STEADILY,
IT WAS NOT QUITE FIRM; AN UNEVENNESS IN THE FLOOR, I BELIEVE.
YOU SEE WE HAVE BEEN WEDGING ONE LEG WITH PAPER.  THIS WAS VERY KIND
OF YOU TO BE PERSUADED TO COME.  I WAS ALMOST AFRAID YOU WOULD BE
HURRYING HOME."

HE CONTRIVED THAT SHE SHOULD BE SEATED BY HIM; AND WAS SUFFICIENTLY
EMPLOYED IN LOOKING OUT THE BEST BAKED APPLE FOR HER, AND TRYING
TO MAKE HER HELP OR ADVISE HIM IN HIS WORK, TILL JANE FAIRFAX WAS
QUITE READY TO SIT DOWN TO THE PIANOFORTE AGAIN.  THAT SHE WAS NOT
IMMEDIATELY READY, EMMA DID SUSPECT TO ARISE FROM THE STATE OF HER NERVES;
SHE HAD NOT YET POSSESSED THE INSTRUMENT LONG ENOUGH TO TOUCH IT
WITHOUT EMOTION; SHE MUST REASON HERSELF INTO THE POWER OF PERFORMANCE;
AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT PITY SUCH FEELINGS, WHATEVER THEIR ORIGIN,
AND COULD NOT BUT RESOLVE NEVER TO EXPOSE THEM TO HER NEIGHBOUR AGAIN.

AT LAST JANE BEGAN, AND THOUGH THE FIRST BARS WERE FEEBLY GIVEN,
THE POWERS OF THE INSTRUMENT WERE GRADUALLY DONE FULL JUSTICE TO.
MRS. WESTON HAD BEEN DELIGHTED BEFORE, AND WAS DELIGHTED AGAIN;
EMMA JOINED HER IN ALL HER PRAISE; AND THE PIANOFORTE, WITH EVERY
PROPER DISCRIMINATION, WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE ALTOGETHER OF THE
HIGHEST PROMISE.

"WHOEVER COLONEL CAMPBELL MIGHT EMPLOY," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL,
WITH A SMILE AT EMMA, "THE PERSON HAS NOT CHOSEN ILL.  I HEARD A GOOD
DEAL OF COLONEL CAMPBELL'S TASTE AT WEYMOUTH; AND THE SOFTNESS OF THE
UPPER NOTES I AM SURE IS EXACTLY WHAT HE AND _ALL_ _THAT_ _PARTY_ WOULD
PARTICULARLY PRIZE.  I DARE SAY, MISS FAIRFAX, THAT HE EITHER GAVE
HIS FRIEND VERY MINUTE DIRECTIONS, OR WROTE TO BROADWOOD HIMSELF.
DO NOT YOU THINK SO?"

JANE DID NOT LOOK ROUND.  SHE WAS NOT OBLIGED TO HEAR.  MRS. WESTON
HAD BEEN SPEAKING TO HER AT THE SAME MOMENT.

"IT IS NOT FAIR," SAID EMMA, IN A WHISPER; "MINE WAS A RANDOM GUESS.
DO NOT DISTRESS HER."

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A SMILE, AND LOOKED AS IF HE HAD VERY LITTLE
DOUBT AND VERY LITTLE MERCY.  SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN AGAIN,

"HOW MUCH YOUR FRIENDS IN IRELAND MUST BE ENJOYING YOUR PLEASURE
ON THIS OCCASION, MISS FAIRFAX.  I DARE SAY THEY OFTEN THINK OF YOU,
AND WONDER WHICH WILL BE THE DAY, THE PRECISE DAY OF THE INSTRUMENT'S
COMING TO HAND.  DO YOU IMAGINE COLONEL CAMPBELL KNOWS THE BUSINESS
TO BE GOING FORWARD JUST AT THIS TIME?--DO YOU IMAGINE IT TO BE
THE CONSEQUENCE OF AN IMMEDIATE COMMISSION FROM HIM, OR THAT HE MAY
HAVE SENT ONLY A GENERAL DIRECTION, AN ORDER INDEFINITE AS TO TIME,
TO DEPEND UPON CONTINGENCIES AND CONVENIENCES?"

HE PAUSED.  SHE COULD NOT BUT HEAR; SHE COULD NOT AVOID ANSWERING,

"TILL I HAVE A LETTER FROM COLONEL CAMPBELL," SAID SHE, IN A VOICE
OF FORCED CALMNESS, "I CAN IMAGINE NOTHING WITH ANY CONFIDENCE.
IT MUST BE ALL CONJECTURE."

"CONJECTURE--AYE, SOMETIMES ONE CONJECTURES RIGHT, AND SOMETIMES
ONE CONJECTURES WRONG.  I WISH I COULD CONJECTURE HOW SOON I SHALL
MAKE THIS RIVET QUITE FIRM.  WHAT NONSENSE ONE TALKS, MISS WOODHOUSE,
WHEN HARD AT WORK, IF ONE TALKS AT ALL;--YOUR REAL WORKMEN,
I SUPPOSE, HOLD THEIR TONGUES; BUT WE GENTLEMEN LABOURERS IF WE GET
HOLD OF A WORD--MISS FAIRFAX SAID SOMETHING ABOUT CONJECTURING.
THERE, IT IS DONE.  I HAVE THE PLEASURE, MADAM, (TO MRS. BATES,)
OF RESTORING YOUR SPECTACLES, HEALED FOR THE PRESENT."

HE WAS VERY WARMLY THANKED BOTH BY MOTHER AND DAUGHTER; TO ESCAPE
A LITTLE FROM THE LATTER, HE WENT TO THE PIANOFORTE, AND BEGGED
MISS FAIRFAX, WHO WAS STILL SITTING AT IT, TO PLAY SOMETHING MORE.

"IF YOU ARE VERY KIND," SAID HE, "IT WILL BE ONE OF THE WALTZES
WE DANCED LAST NIGHT;--LET ME LIVE THEM OVER AGAIN.  YOU DID NOT
ENJOY THEM AS I DID; YOU APPEARED TIRED THE WHOLE TIME.  I BELIEVE
YOU WERE GLAD WE DANCED NO LONGER; BUT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN WORLDS--
ALL THE WORLDS ONE EVER HAS TO GIVE--FOR ANOTHER HALF-HOUR."

SHE PLAYED.

"WHAT FELICITY IT IS TO HEAR A TUNE AGAIN WHICH _HAS_ MADE ONE HAPPY!--
IF I MISTAKE NOT THAT WAS DANCED AT WEYMOUTH."

SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM FOR A MOMENT, COLOURED DEEPLY, AND PLAYED
SOMETHING ELSE.  HE TOOK SOME MUSIC FROM A CHAIR NEAR THE PIANOFORTE,
AND TURNING TO EMMA, SAID,

"HERE IS SOMETHING QUITE NEW TO ME.  DO YOU KNOW IT?--CRAMER.--
AND HERE ARE A NEW SET OF IRISH MELODIES.  THAT, FROM SUCH A QUARTER,
ONE MIGHT EXPECT.  THIS WAS ALL SENT WITH THE INSTRUMENT.  VERY THOUGHTFUL
OF COLONEL CAMPBELL, WAS NOT IT?--HE KNEW MISS FAIRFAX COULD HAVE
NO MUSIC HERE.  I HONOUR THAT PART OF THE ATTENTION PARTICULARLY;
IT SHEWS IT TO HAVE BEEN SO THOROUGHLY FROM THE HEART.  NOTHING HASTILY
DONE; NOTHING INCOMPLETE.  TRUE AFFECTION ONLY COULD HAVE PROMPTED IT."

EMMA WISHED HE WOULD BE LESS POINTED, YET COULD NOT HELP BEING AMUSED;
AND WHEN ON GLANCING HER EYE TOWARDS JANE FAIRFAX SHE CAUGHT
THE REMAINS OF A SMILE, WHEN SHE SAW THAT WITH ALL THE DEEP BLUSH
OF CONSCIOUSNESS, THERE HAD BEEN A SMILE OF SECRET DELIGHT,
SHE HAD LESS SCRUPLE IN THE AMUSEMENT, AND MUCH LESS COMPUNCTION
WITH RESPECT TO HER.--THIS AMIABLE, UPRIGHT, PERFECT JANE FAIRFAX
WAS APPARENTLY CHERISHING VERY REPREHENSIBLE FEELINGS.

HE BROUGHT ALL THE MUSIC TO HER, AND THEY LOOKED IT OVER TOGETHER.--
EMMA TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF WHISPERING,

"YOU SPEAK TOO PLAIN.  SHE MUST UNDERSTAND YOU."

"I HOPE SHE DOES.  I WOULD HAVE HER UNDERSTAND ME.  I AM NOT
IN THE LEAST ASHAMED OF MY MEANING."

"BUT REALLY, I AM HALF ASHAMED, AND WISH I HAD NEVER TAKEN UP
THE IDEA."

"I AM VERY GLAD YOU DID, AND THAT YOU COMMUNICATED IT TO ME.
I HAVE NOW A KEY TO ALL HER ODD LOOKS AND WAYS.  LEAVE SHAME TO HER.
IF SHE DOES WRONG, SHE OUGHT TO FEEL IT."

"SHE IS NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT IT, I THINK."

"I DO NOT SEE MUCH SIGN OF IT.  SHE IS PLAYING _ROBIN_ _ADAIR_
AT THIS MOMENT--_HIS_ FAVOURITE."

SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MISS BATES, PASSING NEAR THE WINDOW,
DESCRIED MR. KNIGHTLEY ON HORSE-BACK NOT FAR OFF.

"MR. KNIGHTLEY I DECLARE!--I MUST SPEAK TO HIM IF POSSIBLE,
JUST TO THANK HIM.  I WILL NOT OPEN THE WINDOW HERE; IT WOULD GIVE
YOU ALL COLD; BUT I CAN GO INTO MY MOTHER'S ROOM YOU KNOW.  I DARE
SAY HE WILL COME IN WHEN HE KNOWS WHO IS HERE.  QUITE DELIGHTFUL
TO HAVE YOU ALL MEET SO!--OUR LITTLE ROOM SO HONOURED!"

SHE WAS IN THE ADJOINING CHAMBER WHILE SHE STILL SPOKE, AND OPENING
THE CASEMENT THERE, IMMEDIATELY CALLED MR. KNIGHTLEY'S ATTENTION,
AND EVERY SYLLABLE OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS AS DISTINCTLY HEARD
BY THE OTHERS, AS IF IT HAD PASSED WITHIN THE SAME APARTMENT.

"HOW D' YE DO?--HOW D'YE DO?--VERY WELL, I THANK YOU.  SO OBLIGED
TO YOU FOR THE CARRIAGE LAST NIGHT.  WE WERE JUST IN TIME;
MY MOTHER JUST READY FOR US.  PRAY COME IN; DO COME IN.  YOU WILL
FIND SOME FRIENDS HERE."

SO BEGAN MISS BATES; AND MR. KNIGHTLEY SEEMED DETERMINED TO BE HEARD
IN HIS TURN, FOR MOST RESOLUTELY AND COMMANDINGLY DID HE SAY,

"HOW IS YOUR NIECE, MISS BATES?--I WANT TO INQUIRE AFTER YOU ALL,
BUT PARTICULARLY YOUR NIECE.  HOW IS MISS FAIRFAX?--I HOPE SHE
CAUGHT NO COLD LAST NIGHT.  HOW IS SHE TO-DAY? TELL ME HOW MISS
FAIRFAX IS."

AND MISS BATES WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE A DIRECT ANSWER BEFORE HE
WOULD HEAR HER IN ANY THING ELSE.  THE LISTENERS WERE AMUSED;
AND MRS. WESTON GAVE EMMA A LOOK OF PARTICULAR MEANING.  BUT EMMA
STILL SHOOK HER HEAD IN STEADY SCEPTICISM.

"SO OBLIGED TO YOU!--SO VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE CARRIAGE,"
RESUMED MISS BATES.

HE CUT HER SHORT WITH,

"I AM GOING TO KINGSTON.  CAN I DO ANY THING FOR YOU?"

"OH! DEAR, KINGSTON--ARE YOU?--MRS. COLE WAS SAYING THE OTHER DAY
SHE WANTED SOMETHING FROM KINGSTON."

"MRS. COLE HAS SERVANTS TO SEND.  CAN I DO ANY THING FOR _YOU_?"

"NO, I THANK YOU.  BUT DO COME IN.  WHO DO YOU THINK IS HERE?--
MISS WOODHOUSE AND MISS SMITH; SO KIND AS TO CALL TO HEAR THE
NEW PIANOFORTE.  DO PUT UP YOUR HORSE AT THE CROWN, AND COME IN."

"WELL," SAID HE, IN A DELIBERATING MANNER, "FOR FIVE MINUTES, PERHAPS."

"AND HERE IS MRS. WESTON AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL TOO!--QUITE DELIGHTFUL;
SO MANY FRIENDS!"

"NO, NOT NOW, I THANK YOU.  I COULD NOT STAY TWO MINUTES.
I MUST GET ON TO KINGSTON AS FAST AS I CAN."

"OH! DO COME IN.  THEY WILL BE SO VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU."

"NO, NO; YOUR ROOM IS FULL ENOUGH.  I WILL CALL ANOTHER DAY,
AND HEAR THE PIANOFORTE."

"WELL, I AM SO SORRY!--OH!  MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PARTY
LAST NIGHT; HOW EXTREMELY PLEASANT.--DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH DANCING?--
WAS NOT IT DELIGHTFUL?--MISS WOODHOUSE AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL;
I NEVER SAW ANY THING EQUAL TO IT."

"OH! VERY DELIGHTFUL INDEED; I CAN SAY NOTHING LESS, FOR I SUPPOSE
MISS WOODHOUSE AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL ARE HEARING EVERY THING
THAT PASSES.  AND (RAISING HIS VOICE STILL MORE) I DO NOT SEE WHY MISS
FAIRFAX SHOULD NOT BE MENTIONED TOO.  I THINK MISS FAIRFAX DANCES
VERY WELL; AND MRS. WESTON IS THE VERY BEST COUNTRY-DANCE PLAYER,
WITHOUT EXCEPTION, IN ENGLAND.  NOW, IF YOUR FRIENDS HAVE ANY GRATITUDE,
THEY WILL SAY SOMETHING PRETTY LOUD ABOUT YOU AND ME IN RETURN;
BUT I CANNOT STAY TO HEAR IT."

"OH!  MR. KNIGHTLEY, ONE MOMENT MORE; SOMETHING OF CONSEQUENCE--
SO SHOCKED!--JANE AND I ARE BOTH SO SHOCKED ABOUT THE APPLES!"

"WHAT IS THE MATTER NOW?"

"TO THINK OF YOUR SENDING US ALL YOUR STORE APPLES.  YOU SAID YOU HAD
A GREAT MANY, AND NOW YOU HAVE NOT ONE LEFT.  WE REALLY ARE SO SHOCKED!
MRS. HODGES MAY WELL BE ANGRY.  WILLIAM LARKINS MENTIONED IT HERE.
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT, INDEED YOU SHOULD NOT.  AH! HE IS OFF.
HE NEVER CAN BEAR TO BE THANKED.  BUT I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE STAID NOW,
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PITY NOT TO HAVE MENTIONED. . . . WELL,
(RETURNING TO THE ROOM,) I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SUCCEED.
MR. KNIGHTLEY CANNOT STOP.  HE IS GOING TO KINGSTON.  HE ASKED ME
IF HE COULD DO ANY THING. . . ."

"YES," SAID JANE, "WE HEARD HIS KIND OFFERS, WE HEARD EVERY THING."

"OH! YES, MY DEAR, I DARE SAY YOU MIGHT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE DOOR
WAS OPEN, AND THE WINDOW WAS OPEN, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY SPOKE LOUD.
YOU MUST HAVE HEARD EVERY THING TO BE SURE.  `CAN I DO ANY THING
FOR YOU AT KINGSTON?' SAID HE; SO I JUST MENTIONED. . . . OH!
MISS WOODHOUSE, MUST YOU BE GOING?--YOU SEEM BUT JUST COME--SO VERY
OBLIGING OF YOU."

EMMA FOUND IT REALLY TIME TO BE AT HOME; THE VISIT HAD ALREADY
LASTED LONG; AND ON EXAMINING WATCHES, SO MUCH OF THE MORNING WAS
PERCEIVED TO BE GONE, THAT MRS. WESTON AND HER COMPANION TAKING
LEAVE ALSO, COULD ALLOW THEMSELVES ONLY TO WALK WITH THE TWO YOUNG
LADIES TO HARTFIELD GATES, BEFORE THEY SET OFF FOR RANDALLS.



CHAPTER XI


IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DO WITHOUT DANCING ENTIRELY.  INSTANCES HAVE
BEEN KNOWN OF YOUNG PEOPLE PASSING MANY, MANY MONTHS SUCCESSIVELY,
WITHOUT BEING AT ANY BALL OF ANY DESCRIPTION, AND NO MATERIAL INJURY
ACCRUE EITHER TO BODY OR MIND;--BUT WHEN A BEGINNING IS MADE--
WHEN THE FELICITIES OF RAPID MOTION HAVE ONCE BEEN, THOUGH SLIGHTLY,
FELT--IT MUST BE A VERY HEAVY SET THAT DOES NOT ASK FOR MORE.

FRANK CHURCHILL HAD DANCED ONCE AT HIGHBURY, AND LONGED TO DANCE AGAIN;
AND THE LAST HALF-HOUR OF AN EVENING WHICH MR. WOODHOUSE WAS PERSUADED
TO SPEND WITH HIS DAUGHTER AT RANDALLS, WAS PASSED BY THE TWO YOUNG
PEOPLE IN SCHEMES ON THE SUBJECT.  FRANK'S WAS THE FIRST IDEA;
AND HIS THE GREATEST ZEAL IN PURSUING IT; FOR THE LADY WAS THE BEST
JUDGE OF THE DIFFICULTIES, AND THE MOST SOLICITOUS FOR ACCOMMODATION
AND APPEARANCE.  BUT STILL SHE HAD INCLINATION ENOUGH FOR SHEWING
PEOPLE AGAIN HOW DELIGHTFULLY MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS
WOODHOUSE DANCED--FOR DOING THAT IN WHICH SHE NEED NOT BLUSH TO COMPARE
HERSELF WITH JANE FAIRFAX--AND EVEN FOR SIMPLE DANCING ITSELF,
WITHOUT ANY OF THE WICKED AIDS OF VANITY--TO ASSIST HIM FIRST
IN PACING OUT THE ROOM THEY WERE IN TO SEE WHAT IT COULD BE MADE
TO HOLD--AND THEN IN TAKING THE DIMENSIONS OF THE OTHER PARLOUR,
IN THE HOPE OF DISCOVERING, IN SPITE OF ALL THAT MR. WESTON COULD
SAY OF THEIR EXACTLY EQUAL SIZE, THAT IT WAS A LITTLE THE LARGEST.

HIS FIRST PROPOSITION AND REQUEST, THAT THE DANCE BEGUN AT MR. COLE'S
SHOULD BE FINISHED THERE--THAT THE SAME PARTY SHOULD BE COLLECTED,
AND THE SAME MUSICIAN ENGAGED, MET WITH THE READIEST ACQUIESCENCE.
MR. WESTON ENTERED INTO THE IDEA WITH THOROUGH ENJOYMENT,
AND MRS. WESTON MOST WILLINGLY UNDERTOOK TO PLAY AS LONG AS THEY
COULD WISH TO DANCE; AND THE INTERESTING EMPLOYMENT HAD FOLLOWED,
OF RECKONING UP EXACTLY WHO THERE WOULD BE, AND PORTIONING OUT THE
INDISPENSABLE DIVISION OF SPACE TO EVERY COUPLE.

"YOU AND MISS SMITH, AND MISS FAIRFAX, WILL BE THREE, AND THE TWO
MISS COXES FIVE," HAD BEEN REPEATED MANY TIMES OVER.  "AND THERE
WILL BE THE TWO GILBERTS, YOUNG COX, MY FATHER, AND MYSELF,
BESIDES MR. KNIGHTLEY.  YES, THAT WILL BE QUITE ENOUGH FOR PLEASURE.
YOU AND MISS SMITH, AND MISS FAIRFAX, WILL BE THREE, AND THE TWO MISS
COXES FIVE; AND FOR FIVE COUPLE THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF ROOM."

BUT SOON IT CAME TO BE ON ONE SIDE,

"BUT WILL THERE BE GOOD ROOM FOR FIVE COUPLE?--I REALLY DO NOT THINK
THERE WILL."

ON ANOTHER,

"AND AFTER ALL, FIVE COUPLE ARE NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH
WHILE TO STAND UP.  FIVE COUPLE ARE NOTHING, WHEN ONE THINKS
SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT.  IT WILL NOT DO TO _INVITE_ FIVE COUPLE.
IT CAN BE ALLOWABLE ONLY AS THE THOUGHT OF THE MOMENT."

SOMEBODY SAID THAT _MISS_ GILBERT WAS EXPECTED AT HER BROTHER'S,
AND MUST BE INVITED WITH THE REST.  SOMEBODY ELSE BELIEVED
_MRS_. GILBERT WOULD HAVE DANCED THE OTHER EVENING, IF SHE HAD
BEEN ASKED.  A WORD WAS PUT IN FOR A SECOND YOUNG COX; AND AT LAST,
MR. WESTON NAMING ONE FAMILY OF COUSINS WHO MUST BE INCLUDED,
AND ANOTHER OF VERY OLD ACQUAINTANCE WHO COULD NOT BE LEFT OUT,
IT BECAME A CERTAINTY THAT THE FIVE COUPLE WOULD BE AT LEAST TEN,
AND A VERY INTERESTING SPECULATION IN WHAT POSSIBLE MANNER THEY
COULD BE DISPOSED OF.

THE DOORS OF THE TWO ROOMS WERE JUST OPPOSITE EACH OTHER.
"MIGHT NOT THEY USE BOTH ROOMS, AND DANCE ACROSS THE PASSAGE?"
IT SEEMED THE BEST SCHEME; AND YET IT WAS NOT SO GOOD BUT THAT
MANY OF THEM WANTED A BETTER.  EMMA SAID IT WOULD BE AWKWARD;
MRS. WESTON WAS IN DISTRESS ABOUT THE SUPPER; AND MR. WOODHOUSE
OPPOSED IT EARNESTLY, ON THE SCORE OF HEALTH.  IT MADE HIM SO
VERY UNHAPPY, INDEED, THAT IT COULD NOT BE PERSEVERED IN.

"OH! NO," SAID HE; "IT WOULD BE THE EXTREME OF IMPRUDENCE.
I COULD NOT BEAR IT FOR EMMA!--EMMA IS NOT STRONG.  SHE WOULD
CATCH A DREADFUL COLD.  SO WOULD POOR LITTLE HARRIET.
SO YOU WOULD ALL.  MRS. WESTON, YOU WOULD BE QUITE LAID UP;
DO NOT LET THEM TALK OF SUCH A WILD THING.  PRAY DO NOT LET THEM
TALK OF IT.  THAT YOUNG MAN (SPEAKING LOWER) IS VERY THOUGHTLESS.
DO NOT TELL HIS FATHER, BUT THAT YOUNG MAN IS NOT QUITE THE THING.
HE HAS BEEN OPENING THE DOORS VERY OFTEN THIS EVENING, AND KEEPING
THEM OPEN VERY INCONSIDERATELY.  HE DOES NOT THINK OF THE DRAUGHT.
I DO NOT MEAN TO SET YOU AGAINST HIM, BUT INDEED HE IS NOT QUITE
THE THING!"

MRS. WESTON WAS SORRY FOR SUCH A CHARGE.  SHE KNEW THE IMPORTANCE
OF IT, AND SAID EVERY THING IN HER POWER TO DO IT AWAY.  EVERY DOOR
WAS NOW CLOSED, THE PASSAGE PLAN GIVEN UP, AND THE FIRST SCHEME
OF DANCING ONLY IN THE ROOM THEY WERE IN RESORTED TO AGAIN;
AND WITH SUCH GOOD-WILL ON FRANK CHURCHILL'S PART, THAT THE SPACE
WHICH A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE HAD BEEN DEEMED BARELY SUFFICIENT
FOR FIVE COUPLE, WAS NOW ENDEAVOURED TO BE MADE OUT QUITE ENOUGH
FOR TEN.

"WE WERE TOO MAGNIFICENT," SAID HE.  "WE ALLOWED UNNECESSARY ROOM.
TEN COUPLE MAY STAND HERE VERY WELL."

EMMA DEMURRED.  "IT WOULD BE A CROWD--A SAD CROWD; AND WHAT COULD
BE WORSE THAN DANCING WITHOUT SPACE TO TURN IN?"

"VERY TRUE," HE GRAVELY REPLIED; "IT WAS VERY BAD."  BUT STILL HE
WENT ON MEASURING, AND STILL HE ENDED WITH,

"I THINK THERE WILL BE VERY TOLERABLE ROOM FOR TEN COUPLE."

"NO, NO," SAID SHE, "YOU ARE QUITE UNREASONABLE.  IT WOULD BE DREADFUL
TO BE STANDING SO CLOSE!  NOTHING CAN BE FARTHER FROM PLEASURE
THAN TO BE DANCING IN A CROWD--AND A CROWD IN A LITTLE ROOM!"

"THERE IS NO DENYING IT," HE REPLIED.  "I AGREE WITH YOU EXACTLY.
A CROWD IN A LITTLE ROOM--MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU HAVE THE ART OF GIVING
PICTURES IN A FEW WORDS.  EXQUISITE, QUITE EXQUISITE!--STILL, HOWEVER,
HAVING PROCEEDED SO FAR, ONE IS UNWILLING TO GIVE THE MATTER UP.
IT WOULD BE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO MY FATHER--AND ALTOGETHER--I DO
NOT KNOW THAT--I AM RATHER OF OPINION THAT TEN COUPLE MIGHT STAND
HERE VERY WELL."

EMMA PERCEIVED THAT THE NATURE OF HIS GALLANTRY WAS A LITTLE
SELF-WILLED, AND THAT HE WOULD RATHER OPPOSE THAN LOSE THE PLEASURE
OF DANCING WITH HER; BUT SHE TOOK THE COMPLIMENT, AND FORGAVE
THE REST.  HAD SHE INTENDED EVER TO _MARRY_ HIM, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
WORTH WHILE TO PAUSE AND CONSIDER, AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE
OF HIS PREFERENCE, AND THE CHARACTER OF HIS TEMPER; BUT FOR
ALL THE PURPOSES OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE, HE WAS QUITE AMIABLE ENOUGH.

BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT DAY, HE WAS AT HARTFIELD; AND HE ENTERED
THE ROOM WITH SUCH AN AGREEABLE SMILE AS CERTIFIED THE CONTINUANCE
OF THE SCHEME.  IT SOON APPEARED THAT HE CAME TO ANNOUNCE AN IMPROVEMENT.

"WELL, MISS WOODHOUSE," HE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BEGAN, "YOUR INCLINATION
FOR DANCING HAS NOT BEEN QUITE FRIGHTENED AWAY, I HOPE, BY THE
TERRORS OF MY FATHER'S LITTLE ROOMS.  I BRING A NEW PROPOSAL
ON THE SUBJECT:--A THOUGHT OF MY FATHER'S, WHICH WAITS ONLY YOUR
APPROBATION TO BE ACTED UPON.  MAY I HOPE FOR THE HONOUR OF YOUR
HAND FOR THE TWO FIRST DANCES OF THIS LITTLE PROJECTED BALL,
TO BE GIVEN, NOT AT RANDALLS, BUT AT THE CROWN INN?"

"THE CROWN!"

"YES; IF YOU AND MR. WOODHOUSE SEE NO OBJECTION, AND I TRUST YOU CANNOT,
MY FATHER HOPES HIS FRIENDS WILL BE SO KIND AS TO VISIT HIM THERE.
BETTER ACCOMMODATIONS, HE CAN PROMISE THEM, AND NOT A LESS GRATEFUL
WELCOME THAN AT RANDALLS.  IT IS HIS OWN IDEA.  MRS. WESTON SEES
NO OBJECTION TO IT, PROVIDED YOU ARE SATISFIED.  THIS IS WHAT WE
ALL FEEL.  OH! YOU WERE PERFECTLY RIGHT!  TEN COUPLE, IN EITHER OF
THE RANDALLS ROOMS, WOULD HAVE BEEN INSUFFERABLE!--DREADFUL!--I FELT
HOW RIGHT YOU WERE THE WHOLE TIME, BUT WAS TOO ANXIOUS FOR SECURING
_ANY_ _THING_ TO LIKE TO YIELD.  IS NOT IT A GOOD EXCHANGE?--YOU CONSENT--
I HOPE YOU CONSENT?"

"IT APPEARS TO ME A PLAN THAT NOBODY CAN OBJECT TO, IF MR. AND
MRS. WESTON DO NOT.  I THINK IT ADMIRABLE; AND, AS FAR AS I CAN
ANSWER FOR MYSELF, SHALL BE MOST HAPPY--IT SEEMS THE ONLY IMPROVEMENT
THAT COULD BE.  PAPA, DO YOU NOT THINK IT AN EXCELLENT IMPROVEMENT?"

SHE WAS OBLIGED TO REPEAT AND EXPLAIN IT, BEFORE IT WAS FULLY
COMPREHENDED; AND THEN, BEING QUITE NEW, FARTHER REPRESENTATIONS
WERE NECESSARY TO MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE.

"NO; HE THOUGHT IT VERY FAR FROM AN IMPROVEMENT--A VERY BAD PLAN--
MUCH WORSE THAN THE OTHER.  A ROOM AT AN INN WAS ALWAYS DAMP
AND DANGEROUS; NEVER PROPERLY AIRED, OR FIT TO BE INHABITED.
IF THEY MUST DANCE, THEY HAD BETTER DANCE AT RANDALLS.  HE HAD NEVER
BEEN IN THE ROOM AT THE CROWN IN HIS LIFE--DID NOT KNOW THE PEOPLE
WHO KEPT IT BY SIGHT.--OH! NO--A VERY BAD PLAN.  THEY WOULD CATCH
WORSE COLDS AT THE CROWN THAN ANYWHERE."

"I WAS GOING TO OBSERVE, SIR," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL,
"THAT ONE OF THE GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS CHANGE WOULD
BE THE VERY LITTLE DANGER OF ANY BODY'S CATCHING COLD--
SO MUCH LESS DANGER AT THE CROWN THAN AT RANDALLS!  MR. PERRY
MIGHT HAVE REASON TO REGRET THE ALTERATION, BUT NOBODY ELSE COULD."

"SIR," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE, RATHER WARMLY, "YOU ARE VERY MUCH
MISTAKEN IF YOU SUPPOSE MR. PERRY TO BE THAT SORT OF CHARACTER.
MR. PERRY IS EXTREMELY CONCERNED WHEN ANY OF US ARE ILL.  BUT I
DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE ROOM AT THE CROWN CAN BE SAFER FOR YOU
THAN YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE."

"FROM THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF ITS BEING LARGER, SIR.  WE SHALL HAVE
NO OCCASION TO OPEN THE WINDOWS AT ALL--NOT ONCE THE WHOLE EVENING;
AND IT IS THAT DREADFUL HABIT OF OPENING THE WINDOWS, LETTING IN COLD
AIR UPON HEATED BODIES, WHICH (AS YOU WELL KNOW, SIR) DOES THE MISCHIEF."

"OPEN THE WINDOWS!--BUT SURELY, MR. CHURCHILL, NOBODY WOULD THINK
OF OPENING THE WINDOWS AT RANDALLS.  NOBODY COULD BE SO IMPRUDENT!
I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING.  DANCING WITH OPEN WINDOWS!--I AM SURE,
NEITHER YOUR FATHER NOR MRS. WESTON (POOR MISS TAYLOR THAT WAS)
WOULD SUFFER IT."

"AH! SIR--BUT A THOUGHTLESS YOUNG PERSON WILL SOMETIMES STEP BEHIND
A WINDOW-CURTAIN, AND THROW UP A SASH, WITHOUT ITS BEING SUSPECTED.
I HAVE OFTEN KNOWN IT DONE MYSELF."

"HAVE YOU INDEED, SIR?--BLESS ME!  I NEVER COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT.
BUT I LIVE OUT OF THE WORLD, AND AM OFTEN ASTONISHED AT WHAT I HEAR.
HOWEVER, THIS DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE; AND, PERHAPS, WHEN WE COME
TO TALK IT OVER--BUT THESE SORT OF THINGS REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL
OF CONSIDERATION.  ONE CANNOT RESOLVE UPON THEM IN A HURRY.
IF MR. AND MRS. WESTON WILL BE SO OBLIGING AS TO CALL HERE ONE MORNING,
WE MAY TALK IT OVER, AND SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE."

"BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, SIR, MY TIME IS SO LIMITED--"

"OH!" INTERRUPTED EMMA, "THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR TALKING
EVERY THING OVER.  THERE IS NO HURRY AT ALL.  IF IT CAN BE CONTRIVED
TO BE AT THE CROWN, PAPA, IT WILL BE VERY CONVENIENT FOR THE HORSES.
THEY WILL BE SO NEAR THEIR OWN STABLE."

"SO THEY WILL, MY DEAR.  THAT IS A GREAT THING.  NOT THAT JAMES
EVER COMPLAINS; BUT IT IS RIGHT TO SPARE OUR HORSES WHEN WE CAN.
IF I COULD BE SURE OF THE ROOMS BEING THOROUGHLY AIRED--BUT IS
MRS. STOKES TO BE TRUSTED?  I DOUBT IT.  I DO NOT KNOW HER,
EVEN BY SIGHT."

"I CAN ANSWER FOR EVERY THING OF THAT NATURE, SIR, BECAUSE IT WILL
BE UNDER MRS. WESTON'S CARE.  MRS. WESTON UNDERTAKES TO DIRECT
THE WHOLE."

"THERE, PAPA!--NOW YOU MUST BE SATISFIED--OUR OWN DEAR MRS. WESTON,
WHO IS CAREFULNESS ITSELF.  DO NOT YOU REMEMBER WHAT MR. PERRY SAID,
SO MANY YEARS AGO, WHEN I HAD THE MEASLES?  `IF _MISS_ _TAYLOR_ UNDERTAKES
TO WRAP MISS EMMA UP, YOU NEED NOT HAVE ANY FEARS, SIR.'  HOW OFTEN
HAVE I HEARD YOU SPEAK OF IT AS SUCH A COMPLIMENT TO HER!"

"AYE, VERY TRUE.  MR. PERRY DID SAY SO.  I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT.
POOR LITTLE EMMA!  YOU WERE VERY BAD WITH THE MEASLES; THAT IS,
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY BAD, BUT FOR PERRY'S GREAT ATTENTION.
HE CAME FOUR TIMES A DAY FOR A WEEK.  HE SAID, FROM THE FIRST,
IT WAS A VERY GOOD SORT--WHICH WAS OUR GREAT COMFORT; BUT THE MEASLES
ARE A DREADFUL COMPLAINT.  I HOPE WHENEVER POOR ISABELLA'S LITTLE ONES
HAVE THE MEASLES, SHE WILL SEND FOR PERRY."

"MY FATHER AND MRS. WESTON ARE AT THE CROWN AT THIS MOMENT,"
SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, "EXAMINING THE CAPABILITIES OF THE HOUSE.
I LEFT THEM THERE AND CAME ON TO HARTFIELD, IMPATIENT FOR YOUR OPINION,
AND HOPING YOU MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO JOIN THEM AND GIVE YOUR ADVICE
ON THE SPOT.  I WAS DESIRED TO SAY SO FROM BOTH.  IT WOULD BE THE
GREATEST PLEASURE TO THEM, IF YOU COULD ALLOW ME TO ATTEND YOU THERE.
THEY CAN DO NOTHING SATISFACTORILY WITHOUT YOU."

EMMA WAS MOST HAPPY TO BE CALLED TO SUCH A COUNCIL; AND HER FATHER,
ENGAGING TO THINK IT ALL OVER WHILE SHE WAS GONE, THE TWO YOUNG
PEOPLE SET OFF TOGETHER WITHOUT DELAY FOR THE CROWN.  THERE WERE
MR. AND MRS. WESTON; DELIGHTED TO SEE HER AND RECEIVE HER APPROBATION,
VERY BUSY AND VERY HAPPY IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAY; SHE, IN SOME
LITTLE DISTRESS; AND HE, FINDING EVERY THING PERFECT.

"EMMA," SAID SHE, "THIS PAPER IS WORSE THAN I EXPECTED.
LOOK! IN PLACES YOU SEE IT IS DREADFULLY DIRTY; AND THE WAINSCOT
IS MORE YELLOW AND FORLORN THAN ANY THING I COULD HAVE IMAGINED."

"MY DEAR, YOU ARE TOO PARTICULAR," SAID HER HUSBAND.  "WHAT DOES
ALL THAT SIGNIFY?  YOU WILL SEE NOTHING OF IT BY CANDLELIGHT.
IT WILL BE AS CLEAN AS RANDALLS BY CANDLELIGHT.  WE NEVER SEE ANY
THING OF IT ON OUR CLUB-NIGHTS."

THE LADIES HERE PROBABLY EXCHANGED LOOKS WHICH MEANT, "MEN NEVER
KNOW WHEN THINGS ARE DIRTY OR NOT;" AND THE GENTLEMEN PERHAPS
THOUGHT EACH TO HIMSELF, "WOMEN WILL HAVE THEIR LITTLE NONSENSES
AND NEEDLESS CARES."

ONE PERPLEXITY, HOWEVER, AROSE, WHICH THE GENTLEMEN DID NOT DISDAIN.
IT REGARDED A SUPPER-ROOM.  AT THE TIME OF THE BALLROOM'S BEING BUILT,
SUPPERS HAD NOT BEEN IN QUESTION; AND A SMALL CARD-ROOM ADJOINING,
WAS THE ONLY ADDITION.  WHAT WAS TO BE DONE?  THIS CARD-ROOM WOULD
BE WANTED AS A CARD-ROOM NOW; OR, IF CARDS WERE CONVENIENTLY VOTED
UNNECESSARY BY THEIR FOUR SELVES, STILL WAS IT NOT TOO SMALL FOR
ANY COMFORTABLE SUPPER?  ANOTHER ROOM OF MUCH BETTER SIZE MIGHT BE
SECURED FOR THE PURPOSE; BUT IT WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE,
AND A LONG AWKWARD PASSAGE MUST BE GONE THROUGH TO GET AT IT.
THIS MADE A DIFFICULTY.  MRS. WESTON WAS AFRAID OF DRAUGHTS
FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THAT PASSAGE; AND NEITHER EMMA NOR THE
GENTLEMEN COULD TOLERATE THE PROSPECT OF BEING MISERABLY CROWDED
AT SUPPER.

MRS. WESTON PROPOSED HAVING NO REGULAR SUPPER; MERELY SANDWICHES,
&C., SET OUT IN THE LITTLE ROOM; BUT THAT WAS SCOUTED AS A
WRETCHED SUGGESTION.  A PRIVATE DANCE, WITHOUT SITTING DOWN TO SUPPER,
WAS PRONOUNCED AN INFAMOUS FRAUD UPON THE RIGHTS OF MEN AND WOMEN;
AND MRS. WESTON MUST NOT SPEAK OF IT AGAIN.  SHE THEN TOOK ANOTHER
LINE OF EXPEDIENCY, AND LOOKING INTO THE DOUBTFUL ROOM, OBSERVED,

"I DO NOT THINK IT _IS_ SO VERY SMALL.  WE SHALL NOT BE MANY,
YOU KNOW."

AND MR. WESTON AT THE SAME TIME, WALKING BRISKLY WITH LONG STEPS
THROUGH THE PASSAGE, WAS CALLING OUT,

"YOU TALK A GREAT DEAL OF THE LENGTH OF THIS PASSAGE, MY DEAR.
IT IS A MERE NOTHING AFTER ALL; AND NOT THE LEAST DRAUGHT FROM
THE STAIRS."

"I WISH," SAID MRS. WESTON, "ONE COULD KNOW WHICH ARRANGEMENT OUR
GUESTS IN GENERAL WOULD LIKE BEST.  TO DO WHAT WOULD BE MOST GENERALLY
PLEASING MUST BE OUR OBJECT--IF ONE COULD BUT TELL WHAT THAT WOULD BE."

"YES, VERY TRUE," CRIED FRANK, "VERY TRUE.  YOU WANT YOUR NEIGHBOURS'
OPINIONS.  I DO NOT WONDER AT YOU.  IF ONE COULD ASCERTAIN WHAT THE
CHIEF OF THEM--THE COLES, FOR INSTANCE.  THEY ARE NOT FAR OFF.
SHALL I CALL UPON THEM?  OR MISS BATES?  SHE IS STILL NEARER.--
AND I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER MISS BATES IS NOT AS LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND
THE INCLINATIONS OF THE REST OF THE PEOPLE AS ANY BODY.  I THINK
WE DO WANT A LARGER COUNCIL.  SUPPOSE I GO AND INVITE MISS BATES
TO JOIN US?"

"WELL--IF YOU PLEASE," SAID MRS. WESTON RATHER HESITATING, "IF YOU
THINK SHE WILL BE OF ANY USE."

"YOU WILL GET NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE FROM MISS BATES," SAID EMMA.
"SHE WILL BE ALL DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE, BUT SHE WILL TELL YOU NOTHING.
SHE WILL NOT EVEN LISTEN TO YOUR QUESTIONS.  I SEE NO ADVANTAGE IN
CONSULTING MISS BATES."

"BUT SHE IS SO AMUSING, SO EXTREMELY AMUSING!  I AM VERY FOND
OF HEARING MISS BATES TALK.  AND I NEED NOT BRING THE WHOLE FAMILY,
YOU KNOW."

HERE MR. WESTON JOINED THEM, AND ON HEARING WHAT WAS PROPOSED,
GAVE IT HIS DECIDED APPROBATION.

"AYE, DO, FRANK.--GO AND FETCH MISS BATES, AND LET US END THE MATTER
AT ONCE.  SHE WILL ENJOY THE SCHEME, I AM SURE; AND I DO NOT KNOW
A PROPERER PERSON FOR SHEWING US HOW TO DO AWAY DIFFICULTIES.
FETCH MISS BATES.  WE ARE GROWING A LITTLE TOO NICE.  SHE IS
A STANDING LESSON OF HOW TO BE HAPPY.  BUT FETCH THEM BOTH.
INVITE THEM BOTH."

"BOTH SIR!  CAN THE OLD LADY?" . . .

"THE OLD LADY!  NO, THE YOUNG LADY, TO BE SURE.  I SHALL THINK YOU
A GREAT BLOCKHEAD, FRANK, IF YOU BRING THE AUNT WITHOUT THE NIECE."

"OH!  I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR.  I DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RECOLLECT.
UNDOUBTEDLY IF YOU WISH IT, I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO PERSUADE THEM BOTH."
AND AWAY HE RAN.

LONG BEFORE HE REAPPEARED, ATTENDING THE SHORT, NEAT, BRISK-MOVING AUNT,
AND HER ELEGANT NIECE,--MRS. WESTON, LIKE A SWEET-TEMPERED
WOMAN AND A GOOD WIFE, HAD EXAMINED THE PASSAGE AGAIN,
AND FOUND THE EVILS OF IT MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED BEFORE--
INDEED VERY TRIFLING; AND HERE ENDED THE DIFFICULTIES OF DECISION.
ALL THE REST, IN SPECULATION AT LEAST, WAS PERFECTLY SMOOTH.
ALL THE MINOR ARRANGEMENTS OF TABLE AND CHAIR, LIGHTS AND MUSIC,
TEA AND SUPPER, MADE THEMSELVES; OR WERE LEFT AS MERE TRIFLES
TO BE SETTLED AT ANY TIME BETWEEN MRS. WESTON AND MRS. STOKES.--
EVERY BODY INVITED, WAS CERTAINLY TO COME; FRANK HAD ALREADY WRITTEN
TO ENSCOMBE TO PROPOSE STAYING A FEW DAYS BEYOND HIS FORTNIGHT,
WHICH COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE REFUSED.  AND A DELIGHTFUL DANCE IT WAS
TO BE.

MOST CORDIALLY, WHEN MISS BATES ARRIVED, DID SHE AGREE THAT IT MUST.
AS A COUNSELLOR SHE WAS NOT WANTED; BUT AS AN APPROVER, (A MUCH
SAFER CHARACTER,) SHE WAS TRULY WELCOME.  HER APPROBATION, AT ONCE
GENERAL AND MINUTE, WARM AND INCESSANT, COULD NOT BUT PLEASE;
AND FOR ANOTHER HALF-HOUR THEY WERE ALL WALKING TO AND FRO,
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ROOMS, SOME SUGGESTING, SOME ATTENDING,
AND ALL IN HAPPY ENJOYMENT OF THE FUTURE.  THE PARTY DID NOT BREAK
UP WITHOUT EMMA'S BEING POSITIVELY SECURED FOR THE TWO FIRST DANCES
BY THE HERO OF THE EVENING, NOR WITHOUT HER OVERHEARING MR. WESTON
WHISPER TO HIS WIFE, "HE HAS ASKED HER, MY DEAR.  THAT'S RIGHT.
I KNEW HE WOULD!"



CHAPTER XII


ONE THING ONLY WAS WANTING TO MAKE THE PROSPECT OF THE BALL
COMPLETELY SATISFACTORY TO EMMA--ITS BEING FIXED FOR A DAY WITHIN
THE GRANTED TERM OF FRANK CHURCHILL'S STAY IN SURRY; FOR, IN SPITE
OF MR. WESTON'S CONFIDENCE, SHE COULD NOT THINK IT SO VERY IMPOSSIBLE
THAT THE CHURCHILLS MIGHT NOT ALLOW THEIR NEPHEW TO REMAIN
A DAY BEYOND HIS FORTNIGHT.  BUT THIS WAS NOT JUDGED FEASIBLE.
THE PREPARATIONS MUST TAKE THEIR TIME, NOTHING COULD BE PROPERLY
READY TILL THE THIRD WEEK WERE ENTERED ON, AND FOR A FEW DAYS THEY
MUST BE PLANNING, PROCEEDING AND HOPING IN UNCERTAINTY--AT THE RISK--
IN HER OPINION, THE GREAT RISK, OF ITS BEING ALL IN VAIN.

ENSCOMBE HOWEVER WAS GRACIOUS, GRACIOUS IN FACT, IF NOT IN WORD.
HIS WISH OF STAYING LONGER EVIDENTLY DID NOT PLEASE; BUT IT WAS
NOT OPPOSED.  ALL WAS SAFE AND PROSPEROUS; AND AS THE REMOVAL OF ONE
SOLICITUDE GENERALLY MAKES WAY FOR ANOTHER, EMMA, BEING NOW CERTAIN
OF HER BALL, BEGAN TO ADOPT AS THE NEXT VEXATION MR. KNIGHTLEY'S
PROVOKING INDIFFERENCE ABOUT IT.  EITHER BECAUSE HE DID NOT
DANCE HIMSELF, OR BECAUSE THE PLAN HAD BEEN FORMED WITHOUT HIS
BEING CONSULTED, HE SEEMED RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD NOT INTEREST HIM,
DETERMINED AGAINST ITS EXCITING ANY PRESENT CURIOSITY, OR AFFORDING
HIM ANY FUTURE AMUSEMENT.  TO HER VOLUNTARY COMMUNICATIONS EMMA
COULD GET NO MORE APPROVING REPLY, THAN,

"VERY WELL.  IF THE WESTONS THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO BE AT ALL THIS
TROUBLE FOR A FEW HOURS OF NOISY ENTERTAINMENT, I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY AGAINST IT, BUT THAT THEY SHALL NOT CHUSE PLEASURES FOR ME.--
OH! YES, I MUST BE THERE; I COULD NOT REFUSE; AND I WILL KEEP
AS MUCH AWAKE AS I CAN; BUT I WOULD RATHER BE AT HOME, LOOKING OVER
WILLIAM LARKINS'S WEEK'S ACCOUNT; MUCH RATHER, I CONFESS.--
PLEASURE IN SEEING DANCING!--NOT I, INDEED--I NEVER LOOK AT IT--
I DO NOT KNOW WHO DOES.--FINE DANCING, I BELIEVE, LIKE VIRTUE,
MUST BE ITS OWN REWARD.  THOSE WHO ARE STANDING BY ARE USUALLY
THINKING OF SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT."

THIS EMMA FELT WAS AIMED AT HER; AND IT MADE HER QUITE ANGRY.
IT WAS NOT IN COMPLIMENT TO JANE FAIRFAX HOWEVER THAT HE WAS
SO INDIFFERENT, OR SO INDIGNANT; HE WAS NOT GUIDED BY _HER_ FEELINGS
IN REPROBATING THE BALL, FOR _SHE_ ENJOYED THE THOUGHT OF IT
TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE.  IT MADE HER ANIMATED--OPEN HEARTED--
SHE VOLUNTARILY SAID;--

"OH!  MISS WOODHOUSE, I HOPE NOTHING MAY HAPPEN TO PREVENT THE BALL.
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT IT WOULD BE!  I DO LOOK FORWARD TO IT, I OWN,
WITH _VERY_ GREAT PLEASURE."

IT WAS NOT TO OBLIGE JANE FAIRFAX THEREFORE THAT HE WOULD HAVE
PREFERRED THE SOCIETY OF WILLIAM LARKINS.  NO!--SHE WAS MORE AND MORE
CONVINCED THAT MRS. WESTON WAS QUITE MISTAKEN IN THAT SURMISE.
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FRIENDLY AND OF COMPASSIONATE ATTACHMENT
ON HIS SIDE--BUT NO LOVE.

ALAS! THERE WAS SOON NO LEISURE FOR QUARRELLING WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY.
TWO DAYS OF JOYFUL SECURITY WERE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE
OVER-THROW OF EVERY THING.  A LETTER ARRIVED FROM MR. CHURCHILL
TO URGE HIS NEPHEW'S INSTANT RETURN.  MRS. CHURCHILL WAS UNWELL--
FAR TOO UNWELL TO DO WITHOUT HIM; SHE HAD BEEN IN A VERY SUFFERING
STATE (SO SAID HER HUSBAND) WHEN WRITING TO HER NEPHEW TWO DAYS BEFORE,
THOUGH FROM HER USUAL UNWILLINGNESS TO GIVE PAIN, AND CONSTANT
HABIT OF NEVER THINKING OF HERSELF, SHE HAD NOT MENTIONED IT;
BUT NOW SHE WAS TOO ILL TO TRIFLE, AND MUST ENTREAT HIM TO SET OFF
FOR ENSCOMBE WITHOUT DELAY.

THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS LETTER WAS FORWARDED TO EMMA, IN A NOTE
FROM MRS. WESTON, INSTANTLY.  AS TO HIS GOING, IT WAS INEVITABLE.
HE MUST BE GONE WITHIN A FEW HOURS, THOUGH WITHOUT FEELING ANY REAL
ALARM FOR HIS AUNT, TO LESSEN HIS REPUGNANCE.  HE KNEW HER ILLNESSES;
THEY NEVER OCCURRED BUT FOR HER OWN CONVENIENCE.

MRS. WESTON ADDED, "THAT HE COULD ONLY ALLOW HIMSELF TIME TO
HURRY TO HIGHBURY, AFTER BREAKFAST, AND TAKE LEAVE OF THE FEW
FRIENDS THERE WHOM HE COULD SUPPOSE TO FEEL ANY INTEREST IN HIM;
AND THAT HE MIGHT BE EXPECTED AT HARTFIELD VERY SOON."

THIS WRETCHED NOTE WAS THE FINALE OF EMMA'S BREAKFAST.  WHEN ONCE
IT HAD BEEN READ, THERE WAS NO DOING ANY THING, BUT LAMENT
AND EXCLAIM.  THE LOSS OF THE BALL--THE LOSS OF THE YOUNG MAN--
AND ALL THAT THE YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE FEELING!--IT WAS TOO WRETCHED!--
SUCH A DELIGHTFUL EVENING AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN!--EVERY BODY SO HAPPY!
AND SHE AND HER PARTNER THE HAPPIEST!--"I SAID IT WOULD BE SO,"
WAS THE ONLY CONSOLATION.

HER FATHER'S FEELINGS WERE QUITE DISTINCT.  HE THOUGHT PRINCIPALLY
OF MRS. CHURCHILL'S ILLNESS, AND WANTED TO KNOW HOW SHE WAS TREATED;
AND AS FOR THE BALL, IT WAS SHOCKING TO HAVE DEAR EMMA DISAPPOINTED;
BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE SAFER AT HOME.

EMMA WAS READY FOR HER VISITOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE APPEARED;
BUT IF THIS REFLECTED AT ALL UPON HIS IMPATIENCE, HIS SORROWFUL
LOOK AND TOTAL WANT OF SPIRITS WHEN HE DID COME MIGHT REDEEM HIM.
HE FELT THE GOING AWAY ALMOST TOO MUCH TO SPEAK OF IT.  HIS DEJECTION
WAS MOST EVIDENT.  HE SAT REALLY LOST IN THOUGHT FOR THE FIRST
FEW MINUTES; AND WHEN ROUSING HIMSELF, IT WAS ONLY TO SAY,

"OF ALL HORRID THINGS, LEAVE-TAKING IS THE WORST."

"BUT YOU WILL COME AGAIN," SAID EMMA.  "THIS WILL NOT BE YOUR ONLY
VISIT TO RANDALLS."

"AH!--(SHAKING HIS HEAD)--THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHEN I MAY BE ABLE
TO RETURN!--I SHALL TRY FOR IT WITH A ZEAL!--IT WILL BE THE OBJECT
OF ALL MY THOUGHTS AND CARES!--AND IF MY UNCLE AND AUNT GO TO TOWN
THIS SPRING--BUT I AM AFRAID--THEY DID NOT STIR LAST SPRING--
I AM AFRAID IT IS A CUSTOM GONE FOR EVER."

"OUR POOR BALL MUST BE QUITE GIVEN UP."

"AH! THAT BALL!--WHY DID WE WAIT FOR ANY THING?--WHY NOT SEIZE THE
PLEASURE AT ONCE?--HOW OFTEN IS HAPPINESS DESTROYED BY PREPARATION,
FOOLISH PREPARATION!--YOU TOLD US IT WOULD BE SO.--OH!  MISS WOODHOUSE,
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO RIGHT?"

"INDEED, I AM VERY SORRY TO BE RIGHT IN THIS INSTANCE.  I WOULD
MUCH RATHER HAVE BEEN MERRY THAN WISE."

"IF I CAN COME AGAIN, WE ARE STILL TO HAVE OUR BALL.  MY FATHER
DEPENDS ON IT.  DO NOT FORGET YOUR ENGAGEMENT."

EMMA LOOKED GRACIOUSLY.

"SUCH A FORTNIGHT AS IT HAS BEEN!" HE CONTINUED; "EVERY DAY MORE
PRECIOUS AND MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN THE DAY BEFORE!--EVERY DAY MAKING
ME LESS FIT TO BEAR ANY OTHER PLACE.  HAPPY THOSE, WHO CAN REMAIN
AT HIGHBURY!"

"AS YOU DO US SUCH AMPLE JUSTICE NOW," SAID EMMA, LAUGHING, "I WILL
VENTURE TO ASK, WHETHER YOU DID NOT COME A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY AT FIRST?
DO NOT WE RATHER SURPASS YOUR EXPECTATIONS?  I AM SURE WE DO.
I AM SURE YOU DID NOT MUCH EXPECT TO LIKE US.  YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
SO LONG IN COMING, IF YOU HAD HAD A PLEASANT IDEA OF HIGHBURY."

HE LAUGHED RATHER CONSCIOUSLY; AND THOUGH DENYING THE SENTIMENT,
EMMA WAS CONVINCED THAT IT HAD BEEN SO.

"AND YOU MUST BE OFF THIS VERY MORNING?"

"YES; MY FATHER IS TO JOIN ME HERE:  WE SHALL WALK BACK TOGETHER,
AND I MUST BE OFF IMMEDIATELY.  I AM ALMOST AFRAID THAT EVERY MOMENT
WILL BRING HIM."

"NOT FIVE MINUTES TO SPARE EVEN FOR YOUR FRIENDS MISS FAIRFAX AND
MISS BATES?  HOW UNLUCKY!  MISS BATES'S POWERFUL, ARGUMENTATIVE MIND
MIGHT HAVE STRENGTHENED YOURS."

"YES--I _HAVE_ CALLED THERE; PASSING THE DOOR, I THOUGHT IT BETTER.
IT WAS A RIGHT THING TO DO.  I WENT IN FOR THREE MINUTES, AND WAS
DETAINED BY MISS BATES'S BEING ABSENT.  SHE WAS OUT; AND I FELT IT
IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO WAIT TILL SHE CAME IN.  SHE IS A WOMAN THAT ONE MAY,
THAT ONE _MUST_ LAUGH AT; BUT THAT ONE WOULD NOT WISH TO SLIGHT.
IT WAS BETTER TO PAY MY VISIT, THEN"--

HE HESITATED, GOT UP, WALKED TO A WINDOW.

"IN SHORT," SAID HE, "PERHAPS, MISS WOODHOUSE--I THINK YOU CAN
HARDLY BE QUITE WITHOUT SUSPICION"--

HE LOOKED AT HER, AS IF WANTING TO READ HER THOUGHTS.  SHE HARDLY
KNEW WHAT TO SAY.  IT SEEMED LIKE THE FORERUNNER OF SOMETHING
ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS, WHICH SHE DID NOT WISH.  FORCING HERSELF
TO SPEAK, THEREFORE, IN THE HOPE OF PUTTING IT BY, SHE CALMLY SAID,

"YOU ARE QUITE IN THE RIGHT; IT WAS MOST NATURAL TO PAY YOUR VISIT, THEN"--

HE WAS SILENT.  SHE BELIEVED HE WAS LOOKING AT HER; PROBABLY REFLECTING
ON WHAT SHE HAD SAID, AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MANNER.
SHE HEARD HIM SIGH.  IT WAS NATURAL FOR HIM TO FEEL THAT HE HAD
_CAUSE_ TO SIGH.  HE COULD NOT BELIEVE HER TO BE ENCOURAGING HIM.
A FEW AWKWARD MOMENTS PASSED, AND HE SAT DOWN AGAIN; AND IN A MORE
DETERMINED MANNER SAID,

"IT WAS SOMETHING TO FEEL THAT ALL THE REST OF MY TIME MIGHT BE
GIVEN TO HARTFIELD.  MY REGARD FOR HARTFIELD IS MOST WARM"--

HE STOPT AGAIN, ROSE AGAIN, AND SEEMED QUITE EMBARRASSED.--
HE WAS MORE IN LOVE WITH HER THAN EMMA HAD SUPPOSED; AND WHO CAN SAY
HOW IT MIGHT HAVE ENDED, IF HIS FATHER HAD NOT MADE HIS APPEARANCE?
MR. WOODHOUSE SOON FOLLOWED; AND THE NECESSITY OF EXERTION MADE
HIM COMPOSED.

A VERY FEW MINUTES MORE, HOWEVER, COMPLETED THE PRESENT TRIAL.
MR. WESTON, ALWAYS ALERT WHEN BUSINESS WAS TO BE DONE, AND AS
INCAPABLE OF PROCRASTINATING ANY EVIL THAT WAS INEVITABLE,
AS OF FORESEEING ANY THAT WAS DOUBTFUL, SAID, "IT WAS TIME TO GO;"
AND THE YOUNG MAN, THOUGH HE MIGHT AND DID SIGH, COULD NOT BUT AGREE,
TO TAKE LEAVE.

"I SHALL HEAR ABOUT YOU ALL," SAID HE; "THAT IS MY CHIEF CONSOLATION.
I SHALL HEAR OF EVERY THING THAT IS GOING ON AMONG YOU.  I HAVE
ENGAGED MRS. WESTON TO CORRESPOND WITH ME.  SHE HAS BEEN SO KIND AS
TO PROMISE IT.  OH! THE BLESSING OF A FEMALE CORRESPONDENT, WHEN ONE
IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE ABSENT!--SHE WILL TELL ME EVERY THING.
IN HER LETTERS I SHALL BE AT DEAR HIGHBURY AGAIN."

A VERY FRIENDLY SHAKE OF THE HAND, A VERY EARNEST "GOOD-BYE,"
CLOSED THE SPEECH, AND THE DOOR HAD SOON SHUT OUT FRANK CHURCHILL.
SHORT HAD BEEN THE NOTICE--SHORT THEIR MEETING; HE WAS GONE; AND EMMA
FELT SO SORRY TO PART, AND FORESAW SO GREAT A LOSS TO THEIR LITTLE
SOCIETY FROM HIS ABSENCE AS TO BEGIN TO BE AFRAID OF BEING TOO SORRY,
AND FEELING IT TOO MUCH.

IT WAS A SAD CHANGE.  THEY HAD BEEN MEETING ALMOST EVERY DAY
SINCE HIS ARRIVAL.  CERTAINLY HIS BEING AT RANDALLS HAD GIVEN
GREAT SPIRIT TO THE LAST TWO WEEKS--INDESCRIBABLE SPIRIT; THE IDEA,
THE EXPECTATION OF SEEING HIM WHICH EVERY MORNING HAD BROUGHT,
THE ASSURANCE OF HIS ATTENTIONS, HIS LIVELINESS, HIS MANNERS!
IT HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY FORTNIGHT, AND FORLORN MUST BE THE SINKING
FROM IT INTO THE COMMON COURSE OF HARTFIELD DAYS.  TO COMPLETE EVERY
OTHER RECOMMENDATION, HE HAD _ALMOST_ TOLD HER THAT HE LOVED HER.
WHAT STRENGTH, OR WHAT CONSTANCY OF AFFECTION HE MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO,
WAS ANOTHER POINT; BUT AT PRESENT SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS HAVING
A DECIDEDLY WARM ADMIRATION, A CONSCIOUS PREFERENCE OF HERSELF;
AND THIS PERSUASION, JOINED TO ALL THE REST, MADE HER THINK THAT
SHE _MUST_ BE A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM, IN SPITE OF EVERY PREVIOUS
DETERMINATION AGAINST IT.

"I CERTAINLY MUST," SAID SHE.  "THIS SENSATION OF LISTLESSNESS,
WEARINESS, STUPIDITY, THIS DISINCLINATION TO SIT DOWN AND EMPLOY MYSELF,
THIS FEELING OF EVERY THING'S BEING DULL AND INSIPID ABOUT THE HOUSE!--
I MUST BE IN LOVE; I SHOULD BE THE ODDEST CREATURE IN THE WORLD IF I
WERE NOT--FOR A FEW WEEKS AT LEAST.  WELL! EVIL TO SOME IS ALWAYS
GOOD TO OTHERS.  I SHALL HAVE MANY FELLOW-MOURNERS FOR THE BALL,
IF NOT FOR FRANK CHURCHILL; BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY WILL BE HAPPY.
HE MAY SPEND THE EVENING WITH HIS DEAR WILLIAM LARKINS NOW IF HE LIKES."

MR. KNIGHTLEY, HOWEVER, SHEWED NO TRIUMPHANT HAPPINESS.  HE COULD
NOT SAY THAT HE WAS SORRY ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT; HIS VERY CHEERFUL LOOK
WOULD HAVE CONTRADICTED HIM IF HE HAD; BUT HE SAID, AND VERY STEADILY,
THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE OTHERS, AND WITH
CONSIDERABLE KINDNESS ADDED,

"YOU, EMMA, WHO HAVE SO FEW OPPORTUNITIES OF DANCING, YOU ARE REALLY
OUT OF LUCK; YOU ARE VERY MUCH OUT OF LUCK!"

IT WAS SOME DAYS BEFORE SHE SAW JANE FAIRFAX, TO JUDGE OF HER
HONEST REGRET IN THIS WOEFUL CHANGE; BUT WHEN THEY DID MEET,
HER COMPOSURE WAS ODIOUS.  SHE HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY UNWELL, HOWEVER,
SUFFERING FROM HEADACHE TO A DEGREE, WHICH MADE HER AUNT DECLARE,
THAT HAD THE BALL TAKEN PLACE, SHE DID NOT THINK JANE COULD HAVE
ATTENDED IT; AND IT WAS CHARITY TO IMPUTE SOME OF HER UNBECOMING
INDIFFERENCE TO THE LANGUOR OF ILL-HEALTH.



CHAPTER XIII


EMMA CONTINUED TO ENTERTAIN NO DOUBT OF HER BEING IN LOVE.  HER IDEAS
ONLY VARIED AS TO THE HOW MUCH.  AT FIRST, SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD DEAL;
AND AFTERWARDS, BUT LITTLE.  SHE HAD GREAT PLEASURE IN HEARING FRANK
CHURCHILL TALKED OF; AND, FOR HIS SAKE, GREATER PLEASURE THAN EVER
IN SEEING MR. AND MRS. WESTON; SHE WAS VERY OFTEN THINKING OF HIM,
AND QUITE IMPATIENT FOR A LETTER, THAT SHE MIGHT KNOW HOW HE WAS,
HOW WERE HIS SPIRITS, HOW WAS HIS AUNT, AND WHAT WAS THE CHANCE
OF HIS COMING TO RANDALLS AGAIN THIS SPRING.  BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND,
SHE COULD NOT ADMIT HERSELF TO BE UNHAPPY, NOR, AFTER THE
FIRST MORNING, TO BE LESS DISPOSED FOR EMPLOYMENT THAN USUAL;
SHE WAS STILL BUSY AND CHEERFUL; AND, PLEASING AS HE WAS, SHE COULD
YET IMAGINE HIM TO HAVE FAULTS; AND FARTHER, THOUGH THINKING OF HIM
SO MUCH, AND, AS SHE SAT DRAWING OR WORKING, FORMING A THOUSAND
AMUSING SCHEMES FOR THE PROGRESS AND CLOSE OF THEIR ATTACHMENT,
FANCYING INTERESTING DIALOGUES, AND INVENTING ELEGANT LETTERS;
THE CONCLUSION OF EVERY IMAGINARY DECLARATION ON HIS SIDE WAS THAT SHE
_REFUSED_ _HIM_.  THEIR AFFECTION WAS ALWAYS TO SUBSIDE INTO FRIENDSHIP.
EVERY THING TENDER AND CHARMING WAS TO MARK THEIR PARTING;
BUT STILL THEY WERE TO PART.  WHEN SHE BECAME SENSIBLE OF THIS,
IT STRUCK HER THAT SHE COULD NOT BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE; FOR IN SPITE
OF HER PREVIOUS AND FIXED DETERMINATION NEVER TO QUIT HER FATHER,
NEVER TO MARRY, A STRONG ATTACHMENT CERTAINLY MUST PRODUCE MORE
OF A STRUGGLE THAN SHE COULD FORESEE IN HER OWN FEELINGS.

"I DO NOT FIND MYSELF MAKING ANY USE OF THE WORD _SACRIFICE_," SAID SHE.--
"IN NOT ONE OF ALL MY CLEVER REPLIES, MY DELICATE NEGATIVES,
IS THERE ANY ALLUSION TO MAKING A SACRIFICE.  I DO SUSPECT THAT HE
IS NOT REALLY NECESSARY TO MY HAPPINESS.  SO MUCH THE BETTER.
I CERTAINLY WILL NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO FEEL MORE THAN I DO.  I AM
QUITE ENOUGH IN LOVE.  I SHOULD BE SORRY TO BE MORE."

UPON THE WHOLE, SHE WAS EQUALLY CONTENTED WITH HER VIEW OF HIS FEELINGS.

"_HE_ IS UNDOUBTEDLY VERY MUCH IN LOVE--EVERY THING DENOTES IT--VERY MUCH
IN LOVE INDEED!--AND WHEN HE COMES AGAIN, IF HIS AFFECTION CONTINUE,
I MUST BE ON MY GUARD NOT TO ENCOURAGE IT.--IT WOULD BE MOST
INEXCUSABLE TO DO OTHERWISE, AS MY OWN MIND IS QUITE MADE UP.
NOT THAT I IMAGINE HE CAN THINK I HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING HIM HITHERTO.
NO, IF HE HAD BELIEVED ME AT ALL TO SHARE HIS FEELINGS, HE WOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN SO WRETCHED.  COULD HE HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF ENCOURAGED,
HIS LOOKS AND LANGUAGE AT PARTING WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.--
STILL, HOWEVER, I MUST BE ON MY GUARD.  THIS IS IN THE SUPPOSITION
OF HIS ATTACHMENT CONTINUING WHAT IT NOW IS; BUT I DO NOT KNOW THAT I
EXPECT IT WILL; I DO NOT LOOK UPON HIM TO BE QUITE THE SORT OF MAN--
I DO NOT ALTOGETHER BUILD UPON HIS STEADINESS OR CONSTANCY.--
HIS FEELINGS ARE WARM, BUT I CAN IMAGINE THEM RATHER CHANGEABLE.--
EVERY CONSIDERATION OF THE SUBJECT, IN SHORT, MAKES ME THANKFUL
THAT MY HAPPINESS IS NOT MORE DEEPLY INVOLVED.--I SHALL DO VERY WELL
AGAIN AFTER A LITTLE WHILE--AND THEN, IT WILL BE A GOOD THING OVER;
FOR THEY SAY EVERY BODY IS IN LOVE ONCE IN THEIR LIVES, AND I SHALL
HAVE BEEN LET OFF EASILY."

WHEN HIS LETTER TO MRS. WESTON ARRIVED, EMMA HAD THE PERUSAL OF IT;
AND SHE READ IT WITH A DEGREE OF PLEASURE AND ADMIRATION WHICH MADE
HER AT FIRST SHAKE HER HEAD OVER HER OWN SENSATIONS, AND THINK SHE
HAD UNDERVALUED THEIR STRENGTH.  IT WAS A LONG, WELL-WRITTEN LETTER,
GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF HIS JOURNEY AND OF HIS FEELINGS,
EXPRESSING ALL THE AFFECTION, GRATITUDE, AND RESPECT WHICH WAS
NATURAL AND HONOURABLE, AND DESCRIBING EVERY THING EXTERIOR AND LOCAL
THAT COULD BE SUPPOSED ATTRACTIVE, WITH SPIRIT AND PRECISION.
NO SUSPICIOUS FLOURISHES NOW OF APOLOGY OR CONCERN; IT WAS THE
LANGUAGE OF REAL FEELING TOWARDS MRS. WESTON; AND THE TRANSITION
FROM HIGHBURY TO ENSCOMBE, THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE PLACES IN SOME
OF THE FIRST BLESSINGS OF SOCIAL LIFE WAS JUST ENOUGH TOUCHED ON
TO SHEW HOW KEENLY IT WAS FELT, AND HOW MUCH MORE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
SAID BUT FOR THE RESTRAINTS OF PROPRIETY.--THE CHARM OF HER OWN
NAME WAS NOT WANTING.  _MISS_ _WOODHOUSE_ APPEARED MORE THAN ONCE,
AND NEVER WITHOUT A SOMETHING OF PLEASING CONNEXION, EITHER A
COMPLIMENT TO HER TASTE, OR A REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID;
AND IN THE VERY LAST TIME OF ITS MEETING HER EYE, UNADORNED AS IT
WAS BY ANY SUCH BROAD WREATH OF GALLANTRY, SHE YET COULD DISCERN
THE EFFECT OF HER INFLUENCE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT
PERHAPS OF ALL CONVEYED.  COMPRESSED INTO THE VERY LOWEST VACANT
CORNER WERE THESE WORDS--"I HAD NOT A SPARE MOMENT ON TUESDAY,
AS YOU KNOW, FOR MISS WOODHOUSE'S BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FRIEND.  PRAY MAKE
MY EXCUSES AND ADIEUS TO HER."  THIS, EMMA COULD NOT DOUBT, WAS ALL
FOR HERSELF.  HARRIET WAS REMEMBERED ONLY FROM BEING _HER_ FRIEND.
HIS INFORMATION AND PROSPECTS AS TO ENSCOMBE WERE NEITHER WORSE NOR
BETTER THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED; MRS. CHURCHILL WAS RECOVERING,
AND HE DARED NOT YET, EVEN IN HIS OWN IMAGINATION, FIX A TIME FOR
COMING TO RANDALLS AGAIN.

GRATIFYING, HOWEVER, AND STIMULATIVE AS WAS THE LETTER IN THE
MATERIAL PART, ITS SENTIMENTS, SHE YET FOUND, WHEN IT WAS FOLDED UP
AND RETURNED TO MRS. WESTON, THAT IT HAD NOT ADDED ANY LASTING WARMTH,
THAT SHE COULD STILL DO WITHOUT THE WRITER, AND THAT HE MUST LEARN
TO DO WITHOUT HER.  HER INTENTIONS WERE UNCHANGED.  HER RESOLUTION
OF REFUSAL ONLY GREW MORE INTERESTING BY THE ADDITION OF A SCHEME FOR
HIS SUBSEQUENT CONSOLATION AND HAPPINESS.  HIS RECOLLECTION OF HARRIET,
AND THE WORDS WHICH CLOTHED IT, THE "BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FRIEND,"
SUGGESTED TO HER THE IDEA OF HARRIET'S SUCCEEDING HER IN HIS AFFECTIONS.
WAS IT IMPOSSIBLE?--NO.--HARRIET UNDOUBTEDLY WAS GREATLY HIS
INFERIOR IN UNDERSTANDING; BUT HE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH STRUCK WITH
THE LOVELINESS OF HER FACE AND THE WARM SIMPLICITY OF HER MANNER;
AND ALL THE PROBABILITIES OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND CONNEXION WERE IN
HER FAVOUR.--FOR HARRIET, IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS AND DELIGHTFUL INDEED.

"I MUST NOT DWELL UPON IT," SAID SHE.--"I MUST NOT THINK OF IT.
I KNOW THE DANGER OF INDULGING SUCH SPECULATIONS.  BUT STRANGER
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED; AND WHEN WE CEASE TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER
AS WE DO NOW, IT WILL BE THE MEANS OF CONFIRMING US IN THAT SORT
OF TRUE DISINTERESTED FRIENDSHIP WHICH I CAN ALREADY LOOK FORWARD
TO WITH PLEASURE."

IT WAS WELL TO HAVE A COMFORT IN STORE ON HARRIET'S BEHALF,
THOUGH IT MIGHT BE WISE TO LET THE FANCY TOUCH IT SELDOM; FOR EVIL
IN THAT QUARTER WAS AT HAND.  AS FRANK CHURCHILL'S ARRIVAL HAD
SUCCEEDED MR. ELTON'S ENGAGEMENT IN THE CONVERSATION OF HIGHBURY,
AS THE LATEST INTEREST HAD ENTIRELY BORNE DOWN THE FIRST, SO NOW
UPON FRANK CHURCHILL'S DISAPPEARANCE, MR. ELTON'S CONCERNS WERE
ASSUMING THE MOST IRRESISTIBLE FORM.--HIS WEDDING-DAY WAS NAMED.
HE WOULD SOON BE AMONG THEM AGAIN; MR. ELTON AND HIS BRIDE.
THERE WAS HARDLY TIME TO TALK OVER THE FIRST LETTER FROM ENSCOMBE
BEFORE "MR. ELTON AND HIS BRIDE" WAS IN EVERY BODY'S MOUTH,
AND FRANK CHURCHILL WAS FORGOTTEN.  EMMA GREW SICK AT THE SOUND.
SHE HAD HAD THREE WEEKS OF HAPPY EXEMPTION FROM MR. ELTON;
AND HARRIET'S MIND, SHE HAD BEEN WILLING TO HOPE, HAD BEEN LATELY
GAINING STRENGTH.  WITH MR. WESTON'S BALL IN VIEW AT LEAST,
THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF INSENSIBILITY TO OTHER THINGS;
BUT IT WAS NOW TOO EVIDENT THAT SHE HAD NOT ATTAINED SUCH A STATE
OF COMPOSURE AS COULD STAND AGAINST THE ACTUAL APPROACH--NEW CARRIAGE,
BELL-RINGING, AND ALL.

POOR HARRIET WAS IN A FLUTTER OF SPIRITS WHICH REQUIRED ALL THE
REASONINGS AND SOOTHINGS AND ATTENTIONS OF EVERY KIND THAT EMMA
COULD GIVE.  EMMA FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR HER,
THAT HARRIET HAD A RIGHT TO ALL HER INGENUITY AND ALL HER PATIENCE;
BUT IT WAS HEAVY WORK TO BE FOR EVER CONVINCING WITHOUT PRODUCING
ANY EFFECT, FOR EVER AGREED TO, WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OPINIONS
THE SAME.  HARRIET LISTENED SUBMISSIVELY, AND SAID "IT WAS VERY TRUE--
IT WAS JUST AS MISS WOODHOUSE DESCRIBED--IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE TO
THINK ABOUT THEM--AND SHE WOULD NOT THINK ABOUT THEM ANY LONGER"
BUT NO CHANGE OF SUBJECT COULD AVAIL, AND THE NEXT HALF-HOUR
SAW HER AS ANXIOUS AND RESTLESS ABOUT THE ELTONS AS BEFORE.
AT LAST EMMA ATTACKED HER ON ANOTHER GROUND.

"YOUR ALLOWING YOURSELF TO BE SO OCCUPIED AND SO UNHAPPY ABOUT
MR. ELTON'S MARRYING, HARRIET, IS THE STRONGEST REPROACH YOU CAN
MAKE _ME_.  YOU COULD NOT GIVE ME A GREATER REPROOF FOR THE MISTAKE I
FELL INTO.  IT WAS ALL MY DOING, I KNOW.  I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN IT,
I ASSURE YOU.--DECEIVED MYSELF, I DID VERY MISERABLY DECEIVE YOU--
AND IT WILL BE A PAINFUL REFLECTION TO ME FOR EVER.  DO NOT IMAGINE
ME IN DANGER OF FORGETTING IT."

HARRIET FELT THIS TOO MUCH TO UTTER MORE THAN A FEW WORDS
OF EAGER EXCLAMATION.  EMMA CONTINUED,

"I HAVE NOT SAID, EXERT YOURSELF HARRIET FOR MY SAKE; THINK LESS,
TALK LESS OF MR. ELTON FOR MY SAKE; BECAUSE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE RATHER,
I WOULD WISH IT TO BE DONE, FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN MY COMFORT, A HABIT OF SELF-COMMAND IN YOU, A CONSIDERATION
OF WHAT IS YOUR DUTY, AN ATTENTION TO PROPRIETY, AN ENDEAVOUR
TO AVOID THE SUSPICIONS OF OTHERS, TO SAVE YOUR HEALTH AND CREDIT,
AND RESTORE YOUR TRANQUILLITY.  THESE ARE THE MOTIVES WHICH I
HAVE BEEN PRESSING ON YOU.  THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT--AND SORRY
I AM THAT YOU CANNOT FEEL THEM SUFFICIENTLY TO ACT UPON THEM.
MY BEING SAVED FROM PAIN IS A VERY SECONDARY CONSIDERATION.  I WANT
YOU TO SAVE YOURSELF FROM GREATER PAIN.  PERHAPS I MAY SOMETIMES
HAVE FELT THAT HARRIET WOULD NOT FORGET WHAT WAS DUE--OR RATHER
WHAT WOULD BE KIND BY ME."

THIS APPEAL TO HER AFFECTIONS DID MORE THAN ALL THE REST.
THE IDEA OF WANTING GRATITUDE AND CONSIDERATION FOR MISS WOODHOUSE,
WHOM SHE REALLY LOVED EXTREMELY, MADE HER WRETCHED FOR A WHILE,
AND WHEN THE VIOLENCE OF GRIEF WAS COMFORTED AWAY, STILL REMAINED
POWERFUL ENOUGH TO PROMPT TO WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SUPPORT HER IN IT
VERY TOLERABLY.

"YOU, WHO HAVE BEEN THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE--
WANT GRATITUDE TO YOU!--NOBODY IS EQUAL TO YOU!--I CARE FOR NOBODY
AS I DO FOR YOU!--OH!  MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW UNGRATEFUL I HAVE BEEN!"

SUCH EXPRESSIONS, ASSISTED AS THEY WERE BY EVERY THING THAT LOOK
AND MANNER COULD DO, MADE EMMA FEEL THAT SHE HAD NEVER LOVED HARRIET
SO WELL, NOR VALUED HER AFFECTION SO HIGHLY BEFORE.

"THERE IS NO CHARM EQUAL TO TENDERNESS OF HEART," SAID SHE
AFTERWARDS TO HERSELF.  "THERE IS NOTHING TO BE COMPARED TO IT.
WARMTH AND TENDERNESS OF HEART, WITH AN AFFECTIONATE, OPEN MANNER,
WILL BEAT ALL THE CLEARNESS OF HEAD IN THE WORLD, FOR ATTRACTION,
I AM SURE IT WILL.  IT IS TENDERNESS OF HEART WHICH MAKES MY DEAR
FATHER SO GENERALLY BELOVED--WHICH GIVES ISABELLA ALL HER POPULARITY.--
I HAVE IT NOT--BUT I KNOW HOW TO PRIZE AND RESPECT IT.--HARRIET IS
MY SUPERIOR IN ALL THE CHARM AND ALL THE FELICITY IT GIVES.
DEAR HARRIET!--I WOULD NOT CHANGE YOU FOR THE CLEAREST-HEADED,
LONGEST-SIGHTED, BEST-JUDGING FEMALE BREATHING.  OH! THE COLDNESS
OF A JANE FAIRFAX!--HARRIET IS WORTH A HUNDRED SUCH--AND FOR A WIFE--
A SENSIBLE MAN'S WIFE--IT IS INVALUABLE.  I MENTION NO NAMES;
BUT HAPPY THE MAN WHO CHANGES EMMA FOR HARRIET!"



CHAPTER XIV


MRS. ELTON WAS FIRST SEEN AT CHURCH:  BUT THOUGH DEVOTION MIGHT
BE INTERRUPTED, CURIOSITY COULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY A BRIDE IN A PEW,
AND IT MUST BE LEFT FOR THE VISITS IN FORM WHICH WERE THEN TO BE PAID,
TO SETTLE WHETHER SHE WERE VERY PRETTY INDEED, OR ONLY RATHER PRETTY,
OR NOT PRETTY AT ALL.

EMMA HAD FEELINGS, LESS OF CURIOSITY THAN OF PRIDE OR PROPRIETY,
TO MAKE HER RESOLVE ON NOT BEING THE LAST TO PAY HER RESPECTS;
AND SHE MADE A POINT OF HARRIET'S GOING WITH HER, THAT THE WORST OF
THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE GONE THROUGH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

SHE COULD NOT ENTER THE HOUSE AGAIN, COULD NOT BE IN THE SAME ROOM
TO WHICH SHE HAD WITH SUCH VAIN ARTIFICE RETREATED THREE MONTHS AGO,
TO LACE UP HER BOOT, WITHOUT _RECOLLECTING_.  A THOUSAND VEXATIOUS
THOUGHTS WOULD RECUR.  COMPLIMENTS, CHARADES, AND HORRIBLE BLUNDERS;
AND IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT POOR HARRIET SHOULD NOT BE
RECOLLECTING TOO; BUT SHE BEHAVED VERY WELL, AND WAS ONLY RATHER
PALE AND SILENT.  THE VISIT WAS OF COURSE SHORT; AND THERE WAS SO
MUCH EMBARRASSMENT AND OCCUPATION OF MIND TO SHORTEN IT, THAT EMMA
WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF ENTIRELY TO FORM AN OPINION OF THE LADY,
AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO GIVE ONE, BEYOND THE NOTHING-MEANING TERMS
OF BEING "ELEGANTLY DRESSED, AND VERY PLEASING."

SHE DID NOT REALLY LIKE HER.  SHE WOULD NOT BE IN A HURRY TO FIND FAULT,
BUT SHE SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS NO ELEGANCE;--EASE, BUT NOT ELEGANCE.--
SHE WAS ALMOST SURE THAT FOR A YOUNG WOMAN, A STRANGER, A BRIDE,
THERE WAS TOO MUCH EASE.  HER PERSON WAS RATHER GOOD; HER FACE
NOT UNPRETTY; BUT NEITHER FEATURE, NOR AIR, NOR VOICE, NOR MANNER,
WERE ELEGANT.  EMMA THOUGHT AT LEAST IT WOULD TURN OUT SO.

AS FOR MR. ELTON, HIS MANNERS DID NOT APPEAR--BUT NO, SHE WOULD
NOT PERMIT A HASTY OR A WITTY WORD FROM HERSELF ABOUT HIS MANNERS.
IT WAS AN AWKWARD CEREMONY AT ANY TIME TO BE RECEIVING WEDDING VISITS,
AND A MAN HAD NEED BE ALL GRACE TO ACQUIT HIMSELF WELL THROUGH IT.
THE WOMAN WAS BETTER OFF; SHE MIGHT HAVE THE ASSISTANCE OF FINE CLOTHES,
AND THE PRIVILEGE OF BASHFULNESS, BUT THE MAN HAD ONLY HIS OWN
GOOD SENSE TO DEPEND ON; AND WHEN SHE CONSIDERED HOW PECULIARLY
UNLUCKY POOR MR. ELTON WAS IN BEING IN THE SAME ROOM AT ONCE WITH
THE WOMAN HE HAD JUST MARRIED, THE WOMAN HE HAD WANTED TO MARRY,
AND THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO MARRY, SHE MUST ALLOW HIM
TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO LOOK AS LITTLE WISE, AND TO BE AS MUCH AFFECTEDLY,
AND AS LITTLE REALLY EASY AS COULD BE.

"WELL, MISS WOODHOUSE," SAID HARRIET, WHEN THEY HAD QUITTED
THE HOUSE, AND AFTER WAITING IN VAIN FOR HER FRIEND TO BEGIN;
"WELL, MISS WOODHOUSE, (WITH A GENTLE SIGH,) WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER?--
IS NOT SHE VERY CHARMING?"

THERE WAS A LITTLE HESITATION IN EMMA'S ANSWER.

"OH! YES--VERY--A VERY PLEASING YOUNG WOMAN."

"I THINK HER BEAUTIFUL, QUITE BEAUTIFUL."

"VERY NICELY DRESSED, INDEED; A REMARKABLY ELEGANT GOWN."

"I AM NOT AT ALL SURPRIZED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE."

"OH! NO--THERE IS NOTHING TO SURPRIZE ONE AT ALL.--A PRETTY FORTUNE;
AND SHE CAME IN HIS WAY."

"I DARE SAY," RETURNED HARRIET, SIGHING AGAIN, "I DARE SAY SHE
WAS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO HIM."

"PERHAPS SHE MIGHT; BUT IT IS NOT EVERY MAN'S FATE TO MARRY THE
WOMAN WHO LOVES HIM BEST.  MISS HAWKINS PERHAPS WANTED A HOME,
AND THOUGHT THIS THE BEST OFFER SHE WAS LIKELY TO HAVE."

"YES," SAID HARRIET EARNESTLY, "AND WELL SHE MIGHT, NOBODY COULD EVER
HAVE A BETTER.  WELL, I WISH THEM HAPPY WITH ALL MY HEART.  AND NOW,
MISS WOODHOUSE, I DO NOT THINK I SHALL MIND SEEING THEM AGAIN.
HE IS JUST AS SUPERIOR AS EVER;--BUT BEING MARRIED, YOU KNOW,
IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING.  NO, INDEED, MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU NEED
NOT BE AFRAID; I CAN SIT AND ADMIRE HIM NOW WITHOUT ANY GREAT MISERY.
TO KNOW THAT HE HAS NOT THROWN HIMSELF AWAY, IS SUCH A COMFORT!--
SHE DOES SEEM A CHARMING YOUNG WOMAN, JUST WHAT HE DESERVES.
HAPPY CREATURE!  HE CALLED HER `AUGUSTA.'  HOW DELIGHTFUL!"

WHEN THE VISIT WAS RETURNED, EMMA MADE UP HER MIND.  SHE COULD THEN
SEE MORE AND JUDGE BETTER.  FROM HARRIET'S HAPPENING NOT TO BE
AT HARTFIELD, AND HER FATHER'S BEING PRESENT TO ENGAGE MR. ELTON,
SHE HAD A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF THE LADY'S CONVERSATION TO HERSELF,
AND COULD COMPOSEDLY ATTEND TO HER; AND THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR QUITE
CONVINCED HER THAT MRS. ELTON WAS A VAIN WOMAN, EXTREMELY WELL
SATISFIED WITH HERSELF, AND THINKING MUCH OF HER OWN IMPORTANCE;
THAT SHE MEANT TO SHINE AND BE VERY SUPERIOR, BUT WITH MANNERS WHICH
HAD BEEN FORMED IN A BAD SCHOOL, PERT AND FAMILIAR; THAT ALL HER
NOTIONS WERE DRAWN FROM ONE SET OF PEOPLE, AND ONE STYLE OF LIVING;
THAT IF NOT FOOLISH SHE WAS IGNORANT, AND THAT HER SOCIETY WOULD
CERTAINLY DO MR. ELTON NO GOOD.

HARRIET WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER MATCH.  IF NOT WISE OR REFINED HERSELF,
SHE WOULD HAVE CONNECTED HIM WITH THOSE WHO WERE; BUT MISS HAWKINS,
IT MIGHT BE FAIRLY SUPPOSED FROM HER EASY CONCEIT, HAD BEEN THE BEST
OF HER OWN SET.  THE RICH BROTHER-IN-LAW NEAR BRISTOL WAS THE PRIDE
OF THE ALLIANCE, AND HIS PLACE AND HIS CARRIAGES WERE THE PRIDE
OF HIM.

THE VERY FIRST SUBJECT AFTER BEING SEATED WAS MAPLE GROVE, "MY BROTHER
MR. SUCKLING'S SEAT;"--A COMPARISON OF HARTFIELD TO MAPLE GROVE.
THE GROUNDS OF HARTFIELD WERE SMALL, BUT NEAT AND PRETTY; AND THE
HOUSE WAS MODERN AND WELL-BUILT. MRS. ELTON SEEMED MOST FAVOURABLY
IMPRESSED BY THE SIZE OF THE ROOM, THE ENTRANCE, AND ALL THAT SHE
COULD SEE OR IMAGINE.  "VERY LIKE MAPLE GROVE INDEED!--SHE WAS QUITE
STRUCK BY THE LIKENESS!--THAT ROOM WAS THE VERY SHAPE AND SIZE
OF THE MORNING-ROOM AT MAPLE GROVE; HER SISTER'S FAVOURITE ROOM."--
MR. ELTON WAS APPEALED TO.--"WAS NOT IT ASTONISHINGLY LIKE?--
SHE COULD REALLY ALMOST FANCY HERSELF AT MAPLE GROVE."

"AND THE STAIRCASE--YOU KNOW, AS I CAME IN, I OBSERVED HOW VERY LIKE
THE STAIRCASE WAS; PLACED EXACTLY IN THE SAME PART OF THE HOUSE.
I REALLY COULD NOT HELP EXCLAIMING!  I ASSURE YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE,
IT IS VERY DELIGHTFUL TO ME, TO BE REMINDED OF A PLACE I AM SO
EXTREMELY PARTIAL TO AS MAPLE GROVE.  I HAVE SPENT SO MANY HAPPY
MONTHS THERE! (WITH A LITTLE SIGH OF SENTIMENT). A CHARMING PLACE,
UNDOUBTEDLY.  EVERY BODY WHO SEES IT IS STRUCK BY ITS BEAUTY;
BUT TO ME, IT HAS BEEN QUITE A HOME.  WHENEVER YOU ARE TRANSPLANTED,
LIKE ME, MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW VERY DELIGHTFUL IT
IS TO MEET WITH ANY THING AT ALL LIKE WHAT ONE HAS LEFT BEHIND.
I ALWAYS SAY THIS IS QUITE ONE OF THE EVILS OF MATRIMONY."

EMMA MADE AS SLIGHT A REPLY AS SHE COULD; BUT IT WAS FULLY SUFFICIENT
FOR MRS. ELTON, WHO ONLY WANTED TO BE TALKING HERSELF.

"SO EXTREMELY LIKE MAPLE GROVE!  AND IT IS NOT MERELY THE HOUSE--
THE GROUNDS, I ASSURE YOU, AS FAR AS I COULD OBSERVE, ARE STRIKINGLY
LIKE.  THE LAURELS AT MAPLE GROVE ARE IN THE SAME PROFUSION AS HERE,
AND STAND VERY MUCH IN THE SAME WAY--JUST ACROSS THE LAWN;
AND I HAD A GLIMPSE OF A FINE LARGE TREE, WITH A BENCH ROUND IT,
WHICH PUT ME SO EXACTLY IN MIND!  MY BROTHER AND SISTER WILL BE
ENCHANTED WITH THIS PLACE.  PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXTENSIVE GROUNDS
THEMSELVES ARE ALWAYS PLEASED WITH ANY THING IN THE SAME STYLE."

EMMA DOUBTED THE TRUTH OF THIS SENTIMENT.  SHE HAD A GREAT IDEA
THAT PEOPLE WHO HAD EXTENSIVE GROUNDS THEMSELVES CARED VERY LITTLE
FOR THE EXTENSIVE GROUNDS OF ANY BODY ELSE; BUT IT WAS NOT WORTH
WHILE TO ATTACK AN ERROR SO DOUBLE-DYED, AND THEREFORE ONLY SAID
IN REPLY,

"WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN MORE OF THIS COUNTRY, I AM AFRAID YOU WILL THINK
YOU HAVE OVERRATED HARTFIELD.  SURRY IS FULL OF BEAUTIES."

"OH! YES, I AM QUITE AWARE OF THAT.  IT IS THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND,
YOU KNOW.  SURRY IS THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND."

"YES; BUT WE MUST NOT REST OUR CLAIMS ON THAT DISTINCTION.
MANY COUNTIES, I BELIEVE, ARE CALLED THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND,
AS WELL AS SURRY."

"NO, I FANCY NOT," REPLIED MRS. ELTON, WITH A MOST SATISFIED SMILE."
I NEVER HEARD ANY COUNTY BUT SURRY CALLED SO."

EMMA WAS SILENCED.

"MY BROTHER AND SISTER HAVE PROMISED US A VISIT IN THE SPRING,
OR SUMMER AT FARTHEST," CONTINUED MRS. ELTON; "AND THAT WILL BE
OUR TIME FOR EXPLORING.  WHILE THEY ARE WITH US, WE SHALL EXPLORE
A GREAT DEAL, I DARE SAY.  THEY WILL HAVE THEIR BAROUCHE-LANDAU,
OF COURSE, WHICH HOLDS FOUR PERFECTLY; AND THEREFORE, WITHOUT SAYING
ANY THING OF _OUR_ CARRIAGE, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLORE THE DIFFERENT
BEAUTIES EXTREMELY WELL.  THEY WOULD HARDLY COME IN THEIR CHAISE,
I THINK, AT THAT SEASON OF THE YEAR.  INDEED, WHEN THE TIME DRAWS ON,
I SHALL DECIDEDLY RECOMMEND THEIR BRINGING THE BAROUCHE-LANDAU;
IT WILL BE SO VERY MUCH PREFERABLE.  WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO A BEAUTIFUL
COUNTRY OF THIS SORT, YOU KNOW, MISS WOODHOUSE, ONE NATURALLY WISHES
THEM TO SEE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE; AND MR. SUCKLING IS EXTREMELY FOND
OF EXPLORING.  WE EXPLORED TO KING'S-WESTON TWICE LAST SUMMER,
IN THAT WAY, MOST DELIGHTFULLY, JUST AFTER THEIR FIRST HAVING THE
BAROUCHE-LANDAU.  YOU HAVE MANY PARTIES OF THAT KIND HERE, I SUPPOSE,
MISS WOODHOUSE, EVERY SUMMER?"

"NO; NOT IMMEDIATELY HERE.  WE ARE RATHER OUT OF DISTANCE OF THE VERY
STRIKING BEAUTIES WHICH ATTRACT THE SORT OF PARTIES YOU SPEAK OF;
AND WE ARE A VERY QUIET SET OF PEOPLE, I BELIEVE; MORE DISPOSED
TO STAY AT HOME THAN ENGAGE IN SCHEMES OF PLEASURE."

"AH! THERE IS NOTHING LIKE STAYING AT HOME FOR REAL COMFORT.
NOBODY CAN BE MORE DEVOTED TO HOME THAN I AM.  I WAS QUITE
A PROVERB FOR IT AT MAPLE GROVE.  MANY A TIME HAS SELINA SAID,
WHEN SHE HAS BEEN GOING TO BRISTOL, `I REALLY CANNOT GET THIS GIRL
TO MOVE FROM THE HOUSE.  I ABSOLUTELY MUST GO IN BY MYSELF, THOUGH I
HATE BEING STUCK UP IN THE BAROUCHE-LANDAU WITHOUT A COMPANION;
BUT AUGUSTA, I BELIEVE, WITH HER OWN GOOD-WILL, WOULD NEVER STIR
BEYOND THE PARK PALING.'  MANY A TIME HAS SHE SAID SO; AND YET I
AM NO ADVOCATE FOR ENTIRE SECLUSION.  I THINK, ON THE CONTRARY,
WHEN PEOPLE SHUT THEMSELVES UP ENTIRELY FROM SOCIETY, IT IS A VERY
BAD THING; AND THAT IT IS MUCH MORE ADVISABLE TO MIX IN THE WORLD IN
A PROPER DEGREE, WITHOUT LIVING IN IT EITHER TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE.
I PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION, HOWEVER, MISS WOODHOUSE--
(LOOKING TOWARDS MR. WOODHOUSE), YOUR FATHER'S STATE OF HEALTH MUST
BE A GREAT DRAWBACK.  WHY DOES NOT HE TRY BATH?--INDEED HE SHOULD.
LET ME RECOMMEND BATH TO YOU.  I ASSURE YOU I HAVE NO DOUBT OF ITS DOING
MR. WOODHOUSE GOOD."

"MY FATHER TRIED IT MORE THAN ONCE, FORMERLY; BUT WITHOUT RECEIVING
ANY BENEFIT; AND MR. PERRY, WHOSE NAME, I DARE SAY, IS NOT UNKNOWN
TO YOU, DOES NOT CONCEIVE IT WOULD BE AT ALL MORE LIKELY TO BE
USEFUL NOW."

"AH! THAT'S A GREAT PITY; FOR I ASSURE YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE,
WHERE THE WATERS DO AGREE, IT IS QUITE WONDERFUL THE RELIEF
THEY GIVE.  IN MY BATH LIFE, I HAVE SEEN SUCH INSTANCES OF IT!
AND IT IS SO CHEERFUL A PLACE, THAT IT COULD NOT FAIL OF BEING OF
USE TO MR. WOODHOUSE'S SPIRITS, WHICH, I UNDERSTAND, ARE SOMETIMES
MUCH DEPRESSED.  AND AS TO ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO _YOU_, I FANCY I
NEED NOT TAKE MUCH PAINS TO DWELL ON THEM.  THE ADVANTAGES OF BATH
TO THE YOUNG ARE PRETTY GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD.  IT WOULD BE A CHARMING
INTRODUCTION FOR YOU, WHO HAVE LIVED SO SECLUDED A LIFE; AND I COULD
IMMEDIATELY SECURE YOU SOME OF THE BEST SOCIETY IN THE PLACE.
A LINE FROM ME WOULD BRING YOU A LITTLE HOST OF ACQUAINTANCE; AND MY
PARTICULAR FRIEND, MRS. PARTRIDGE, THE LADY I HAVE ALWAYS RESIDED
WITH WHEN IN BATH, WOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO SHEW YOU ANY ATTENTIONS,
AND WOULD BE THE VERY PERSON FOR YOU TO GO INTO PUBLIC WITH."

IT WAS AS MUCH AS EMMA COULD BEAR, WITHOUT BEING IMPOLITE.
THE IDEA OF HER BEING INDEBTED TO MRS. ELTON FOR WHAT WAS CALLED
AN _INTRODUCTION_--OF HER GOING INTO PUBLIC UNDER THE AUSPICES
OF A FRIEND OF MRS. ELTON'S--PROBABLY SOME VULGAR, DASHING WIDOW,
WHO, WITH THE HELP OF A BOARDER, JUST MADE A SHIFT TO LIVE!--
THE DIGNITY OF MISS WOODHOUSE, OF HARTFIELD, WAS SUNK INDEED!

SHE RESTRAINED HERSELF, HOWEVER, FROM ANY OF THE REPROOFS SHE COULD
HAVE GIVEN, AND ONLY THANKED MRS. ELTON COOLLY; "BUT THEIR GOING
TO BATH WAS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION; AND SHE WAS NOT PERFECTLY
CONVINCED THAT THE PLACE MIGHT SUIT HER BETTER THAN HER FATHER."
AND THEN, TO PREVENT FARTHER OUTRAGE AND INDIGNATION, CHANGED THE
SUBJECT DIRECTLY.

"I DO NOT ASK WHETHER YOU ARE MUSICAL, MRS. ELTON.  UPON THESE OCCASIONS,
A LADY'S CHARACTER GENERALLY PRECEDES HER; AND HIGHBURY HAS LONG
KNOWN THAT YOU ARE A SUPERIOR PERFORMER."

"OH! NO, INDEED; I MUST PROTEST AGAINST ANY SUCH IDEA.
A SUPERIOR PERFORMER!--VERY FAR FROM IT, I ASSURE YOU.
CONSIDER FROM HOW PARTIAL A QUARTER YOUR INFORMATION CAME.
I AM DOATINGLY FOND OF MUSIC--PASSIONATELY FOND;--AND MY FRIENDS
SAY I AM NOT ENTIRELY DEVOID OF TASTE; BUT AS TO ANY THING ELSE,
UPON MY HONOUR MY PERFORMANCE IS _MEDIOCRE_ TO THE LAST DEGREE.
YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, I WELL KNOW, PLAY DELIGHTFULLY.  I ASSURE YOU
IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST SATISFACTION, COMFORT, AND DELIGHT TO ME,
TO HEAR WHAT A MUSICAL SOCIETY I AM GOT INTO.  I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT
DO WITHOUT MUSIC.  IT IS A NECESSARY OF LIFE TO ME; AND HAVING ALWAYS
BEEN USED TO A VERY MUSICAL SOCIETY, BOTH AT MAPLE GROVE AND IN BATH,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOST SERIOUS SACRIFICE.  I HONESTLY SAID AS MUCH
TO MR. E. WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING OF MY FUTURE HOME, AND EXPRESSING
HIS FEARS LEST THE RETIREMENT OF IT SHOULD BE DISAGREEABLE;
AND THE INFERIORITY OF THE HOUSE TOO--KNOWING WHAT I HAD BEEN
ACCUSTOMED TO--OF COURSE HE WAS NOT WHOLLY WITHOUT APPREHENSION.
WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING OF IT IN THAT WAY, I HONESTLY SAID THAT _THE_
_WORLD_ I COULD GIVE UP--PARTIES, BALLS, PLAYS--FOR I HAD NO FEAR
OF RETIREMENT.  BLESSED WITH SO MANY RESOURCES WITHIN MYSELF,
THE WORLD WAS NOT NECESSARY TO _ME_.  I COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT IT.
TO THOSE WHO HAD NO RESOURCES IT WAS A DIFFERENT THING; BUT MY
RESOURCES MADE ME QUITE INDEPENDENT.  AND AS TO SMALLER-SIZED ROOMS
THAN I HAD BEEN USED TO, I REALLY COULD NOT GIVE IT A THOUGHT.
I HOPED I WAS PERFECTLY EQUAL TO ANY SACRIFICE OF THAT DESCRIPTION.
CERTAINLY I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO EVERY LUXURY AT MAPLE GROVE; BUT I
DID ASSURE HIM THAT TWO CARRIAGES WERE NOT NECESSARY TO MY HAPPINESS,
NOR WERE SPACIOUS APARTMENTS.  `BUT,' SAID I, `TO BE QUITE HONEST,
I DO NOT THINK I CAN LIVE WITHOUT SOMETHING OF A MUSICAL SOCIETY.
I CONDITION FOR NOTHING ELSE; BUT WITHOUT MUSIC, LIFE WOULD BE A BLANK
TO ME.'"

"WE CANNOT SUPPOSE," SAID EMMA, SMILING, "THAT MR. ELTON WOULD HESITATE
TO ASSURE YOU OF THERE BEING A _VERY_ MUSICAL SOCIETY IN HIGHBURY;
AND I HOPE YOU WILL NOT FIND HE HAS OUTSTEPPED THE TRUTH MORE THAN
MAY BE PARDONED, IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MOTIVE."

"NO, INDEED, I HAVE NO DOUBTS AT ALL ON THAT HEAD.  I AM DELIGHTED
TO FIND MYSELF IN SUCH A CIRCLE.  I HOPE WE SHALL HAVE MANY SWEET
LITTLE CONCERTS TOGETHER.  I THINK, MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU AND I
MUST ESTABLISH A MUSICAL CLUB, AND HAVE REGULAR WEEKLY MEETINGS
AT YOUR HOUSE, OR OURS.  WILL NOT IT BE A GOOD PLAN?  IF _WE_
EXERT OURSELVES, I THINK WE SHALL NOT BE LONG IN WANT OF ALLIES.
SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE WOULD BE PARTICULARLY DESIRABLE FOR _ME_,
AS AN INDUCEMENT TO KEEP ME IN PRACTICE; FOR MARRIED WOMEN, YOU KNOW--
THERE IS A SAD STORY AGAINST THEM, IN GENERAL.  THEY ARE BUT TOO APT
TO GIVE UP MUSIC."

"BUT YOU, WHO ARE SO EXTREMELY FOND OF IT--THERE CAN
BE NO DANGER, SURELY?"

"I SHOULD HOPE NOT; BUT REALLY WHEN I LOOK AROUND AMONG MY ACQUAINTANCE,
I TREMBLE.  SELINA HAS ENTIRELY GIVEN UP MUSIC--NEVER TOUCHES
THE INSTRUMENT--THOUGH SHE PLAYED SWEETLY.  AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID
OF MRS. JEFFEREYS--CLARA PARTRIDGE, THAT WAS--AND OF THE TWO MILMANS,
NOW MRS. BIRD AND MRS. JAMES COOPER; AND OF MORE THAN I CAN ENUMERATE.
UPON MY WORD IT IS ENOUGH TO PUT ONE IN A FRIGHT.  I USED TO BE
QUITE ANGRY WITH SELINA; BUT REALLY I BEGIN NOW TO COMPREHEND
THAT A MARRIED WOMAN HAS MANY THINGS TO CALL HER ATTENTION.
I BELIEVE I WAS HALF AN HOUR THIS MORNING SHUT UP WITH MY HOUSEKEEPER."

"BUT EVERY THING OF THAT KIND," SAID EMMA, "WILL SOON
BE IN SO REGULAR A TRAIN--"

"WELL," SAID MRS. ELTON, LAUGHING, "WE SHALL SEE."

EMMA, FINDING HER SO DETERMINED UPON NEGLECTING HER MUSIC,
HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY; AND, AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE, MRS. ELTON
CHOSE ANOTHER SUBJECT.

"WE HAVE BEEN CALLING AT RANDALLS," SAID SHE, "AND FOUND THEM
BOTH AT HOME; AND VERY PLEASANT PEOPLE THEY SEEM TO BE.
I LIKE THEM EXTREMELY.  MR. WESTON SEEMS AN EXCELLENT CREATURE--
QUITE A FIRST-RATE FAVOURITE WITH ME ALREADY, I ASSURE YOU.
AND _SHE_ APPEARS SO TRULY GOOD--THERE IS SOMETHING SO MOTHERLY
AND KIND-HEARTED ABOUT HER, THAT IT WINS UPON ONE DIRECTLY.
SHE WAS YOUR GOVERNESS, I THINK?"

EMMA WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH ASTONISHED TO ANSWER; BUT MRS. ELTON
HARDLY WAITED FOR THE AFFIRMATIVE BEFORE SHE WENT ON.

"HAVING UNDERSTOOD AS MUCH, I WAS RATHER ASTONISHED TO FIND HER
SO VERY LADY-LIKE!  BUT SHE IS REALLY QUITE THE GENTLEWOMAN."

"MRS. WESTON'S MANNERS," SAID EMMA, "WERE ALWAYS PARTICULARLY GOOD.
THEIR PROPRIETY, SIMPLICITY, AND ELEGANCE, WOULD MAKE THEM THE SAFEST
MODEL FOR ANY YOUNG WOMAN."

"AND WHO DO YOU THINK CAME IN WHILE WE WERE THERE?"

EMMA WAS QUITE AT A LOSS.  THE TONE IMPLIED SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCE--
AND HOW COULD SHE POSSIBLY GUESS?

"KNIGHTLEY!" CONTINUED MRS. ELTON; "KNIGHTLEY HIMSELF!--WAS NOT
IT LUCKY?--FOR, NOT BEING WITHIN WHEN HE CALLED THE OTHER DAY,
I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE; AND OF COURSE, AS SO PARTICULAR A
FRIEND OF MR. E.'S, I HAD A GREAT CURIOSITY.  `MY FRIEND KNIGHTLEY'
HAD BEEN SO OFTEN MENTIONED, THAT I WAS REALLY IMPATIENT TO SEE HIM;
AND I MUST DO MY CARO SPOSO THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT HE NEED NOT
BE ASHAMED OF HIS FRIEND.  KNIGHTLEY IS QUITE THE GENTLEMAN.
I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH.  DECIDEDLY, I THINK, A VERY GENTLEMAN-LIKE MAN."

HAPPILY, IT WAS NOW TIME TO BE GONE.  THEY WERE OFF; AND EMMA
COULD BREATHE.

"INSUFFERABLE WOMAN!" WAS HER IMMEDIATE EXCLAMATION.  "WORSE THAN I
HAD SUPPOSED.  ABSOLUTELY INSUFFERABLE!  KNIGHTLEY!--I COULD NOT
HAVE BELIEVED IT.  KNIGHTLEY!--NEVER SEEN HIM IN HER LIFE BEFORE,
AND CALL HIM KNIGHTLEY!--AND DISCOVER THAT HE IS A GENTLEMAN!
A LITTLE UPSTART, VULGAR BEING, WITH HER MR. E., AND HER _CARO_ _SPOSO_,
AND HER RESOURCES, AND ALL HER AIRS OF PERT PRETENSION AND
UNDERBRED FINERY.  ACTUALLY TO DISCOVER THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY IS
A GENTLEMAN!  I DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL RETURN THE COMPLIMENT,
AND DISCOVER HER TO BE A LADY.  I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT!
AND TO PROPOSE THAT SHE AND I SHOULD UNITE TO FORM A MUSICAL CLUB!
ONE WOULD FANCY WE WERE BOSOM FRIENDS!  AND MRS. WESTON!--
ASTONISHED THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD BROUGHT ME UP SHOULD BE
A GENTLEWOMAN!  WORSE AND WORSE.  I NEVER MET WITH HER EQUAL.
MUCH BEYOND MY HOPES.  HARRIET IS DISGRACED BY ANY COMPARISON.
OH! WHAT WOULD FRANK CHURCHILL SAY TO HER, IF HE WERE HERE?
HOW ANGRY AND HOW DIVERTED HE WOULD BE!  AH! THERE I AM--
THINKING OF HIM DIRECTLY.  ALWAYS THE FIRST PERSON TO BE THOUGHT OF!
HOW I CATCH MYSELF OUT!  FRANK CHURCHILL COMES AS REGULARLY INTO
MY MIND!"--

ALL THIS RAN SO GLIBLY THROUGH HER THOUGHTS, THAT BY THE TIME
HER FATHER HAD ARRANGED HIMSELF, AFTER THE BUSTLE OF THE ELTONS'
DEPARTURE, AND WAS READY TO SPEAK, SHE WAS VERY TOLERABLY CAPABLE
OF ATTENDING.

"WELL, MY DEAR," HE DELIBERATELY BEGAN, "CONSIDERING WE NEVER SAW
HER BEFORE, SHE SEEMS A VERY PRETTY SORT OF YOUNG LADY; AND I DARE SAY
SHE WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH YOU.  SHE SPEAKS A LITTLE TOO QUICK.
A LITTLE QUICKNESS OF VOICE THERE IS WHICH RATHER HURTS THE EAR.
BUT I BELIEVE I AM NICE; I DO NOT LIKE STRANGE VOICES; AND NOBODY SPEAKS
LIKE YOU AND POOR MISS TAYLOR.  HOWEVER, SHE SEEMS A VERY OBLIGING,
PRETTY-BEHAVED YOUNG LADY, AND NO DOUBT WILL MAKE HIM A VERY GOOD WIFE.
THOUGH I THINK HE HAD BETTER NOT HAVE MARRIED.  I MADE THE BEST
EXCUSES I COULD FOR NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO WAIT ON HIM AND MRS. ELTON
ON THIS HAPPY OCCASION; I SAID THAT I HOPED I _SHOULD_ IN THE COURSE
OF THE SUMMER.  BUT I OUGHT TO HAVE GONE BEFORE.  NOT TO WAIT UPON
A BRIDE IS VERY REMISS.  AH! IT SHEWS WHAT A SAD INVALID I AM!
BUT I DO NOT LIKE THE CORNER INTO VICARAGE LANE."

"I DARE SAY YOUR APOLOGIES WERE ACCEPTED, SIR.  MR. ELTON KNOWS YOU."

"YES:  BUT A YOUNG LADY--A BRIDE--I OUGHT TO HAVE PAID MY RESPECTS
TO HER IF POSSIBLE.  IT WAS BEING VERY DEFICIENT."

"BUT, MY DEAR PAPA, YOU ARE NO FRIEND TO MATRIMONY; AND THEREFORE
WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO ANXIOUS TO PAY YOUR RESPECTS TO A _BRIDE_?
IT OUGHT TO BE NO RECOMMENDATION TO _YOU_.  IT IS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE
TO MARRY IF YOU MAKE SO MUCH OF THEM."

"NO, MY DEAR, I NEVER ENCOURAGED ANY BODY TO MARRY, BUT I WOULD
ALWAYS WISH TO PAY EVERY PROPER ATTENTION TO A LADY--AND A BRIDE,
ESPECIALLY, IS NEVER TO BE NEGLECTED.  MORE IS AVOWEDLY DUE TO _HER_.
A BRIDE, YOU KNOW, MY DEAR, IS ALWAYS THE FIRST IN COMPANY,
LET THE OTHERS BE WHO THEY MAY."

"WELL, PAPA, IF THIS IS NOT ENCOURAGEMENT TO MARRY, I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT IS.  AND I SHOULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED YOU TO BE LENDING YOUR
SANCTION TO SUCH VANITY-BAITS FOR POOR YOUNG LADIES."

"MY DEAR, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME.  THIS IS A
MATTER OF MERE COMMON POLITENESS AND GOOD-BREEDING,
AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY ENCOURAGEMENT TO PEOPLE TO MARRY."

EMMA HAD DONE.  HER FATHER WAS GROWING NERVOUS, AND COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND _HER_.  HER MIND RETURNED TO MRS. ELTON'S OFFENCES,
AND LONG, VERY LONG, DID THEY OCCUPY HER.



CHAPTER XV


EMMA WAS NOT REQUIRED, BY ANY SUBSEQUENT DISCOVERY, TO RETRACT HER ILL
OPINION OF MRS. ELTON.  HER OBSERVATION HAD BEEN PRETTY CORRECT.
SUCH AS MRS. ELTON APPEARED TO HER ON THIS SECOND INTERVIEW,
SUCH SHE APPEARED WHENEVER THEY MET AGAIN,--SELF-IMPORTANT, PRESUMING,
FAMILIAR, IGNORANT, AND ILL-BRED. SHE HAD A LITTLE BEAUTY AND A
LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENT, BUT SO LITTLE JUDGMENT THAT SHE THOUGHT HERSELF
COMING WITH SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD, TO ENLIVEN AND IMPROVE
A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD; AND CONCEIVED MISS HAWKINS TO HAVE HELD
SUCH A PLACE IN SOCIETY AS MRS. ELTON'S CONSEQUENCE ONLY COULD SURPASS.

THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE MR. ELTON THOUGHT AT ALL DIFFERENTLY
FROM HIS WIFE.  HE SEEMED NOT MERELY HAPPY WITH HER, BUT PROUD.
HE HAD THE AIR OF CONGRATULATING HIMSELF ON HAVING BROUGHT SUCH
A WOMAN TO HIGHBURY, AS NOT EVEN MISS WOODHOUSE COULD EQUAL;
AND THE GREATER PART OF HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE, DISPOSED TO COMMEND,
OR NOT IN THE HABIT OF JUDGING, FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF MISS BATES'S
GOOD-WILL, OR TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE BRIDE MUST BE AS CLEVER
AND AS AGREEABLE AS SHE PROFESSED HERSELF, WERE VERY WELL SATISFIED;
SO THAT MRS. ELTON'S PRAISE PASSED FROM ONE MOUTH TO ANOTHER AS IT
OUGHT TO DO, UNIMPEDED BY MISS WOODHOUSE, WHO READILY CONTINUED HER
FIRST CONTRIBUTION AND TALKED WITH A GOOD GRACE OF HER BEING "VERY
PLEASANT AND VERY ELEGANTLY DRESSED."

IN ONE RESPECT MRS. ELTON GREW EVEN WORSE THAN SHE HAD APPEARED
AT FIRST.  HER FEELINGS ALTERED TOWARDS EMMA.--OFFENDED, PROBABLY,
BY THE LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH HER PROPOSALS OF INTIMACY MET WITH,
SHE DREW BACK IN HER TURN AND GRADUALLY BECAME MUCH MORE COLD
AND DISTANT; AND THOUGH THE EFFECT WAS AGREEABLE, THE ILL-WILL
WHICH PRODUCED IT WAS NECESSARILY INCREASING EMMA'S DISLIKE.
HER MANNERS, TOO--AND MR. ELTON'S, WERE UNPLEASANT TOWARDS HARRIET.
THEY WERE SNEERING AND NEGLIGENT.  EMMA HOPED IT MUST RAPIDLY WORK
HARRIET'S CURE; BUT THE SENSATIONS WHICH COULD PROMPT SUCH BEHAVIOUR
SUNK THEM BOTH VERY MUCH.--IT WAS NOT TO BE DOUBTED THAT POOR
HARRIET'S ATTACHMENT HAD BEEN AN OFFERING TO CONJUGAL UNRESERVE,
AND HER OWN SHARE IN THE STORY, UNDER A COLOURING THE LEAST FAVOURABLE
TO HER AND THE MOST SOOTHING TO HIM, HAD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BEEN
GIVEN ALSO.  SHE WAS, OF COURSE, THE OBJECT OF THEIR JOINT DISLIKE.--
WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE TO SAY, IT MUST BE ALWAYS EASY TO BEGIN
ABUSING MISS WOODHOUSE; AND THE ENMITY WHICH THEY DARED NOT SHEW
IN OPEN DISRESPECT TO HER, FOUND A BROADER VENT IN CONTEMPTUOUS
TREATMENT OF HARRIET.

MRS. ELTON TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO JANE FAIRFAX; AND FROM THE FIRST.
NOT MERELY WHEN A STATE OF WARFARE WITH ONE YOUNG LADY MIGHT BE
SUPPOSED TO RECOMMEND THE OTHER, BUT FROM THE VERY FIRST; AND SHE
WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH EXPRESSING A NATURAL AND REASONABLE ADMIRATION--
BUT WITHOUT SOLICITATION, OR PLEA, OR PRIVILEGE, SHE MUST BE WANTING
TO ASSIST AND BEFRIEND HER.--BEFORE EMMA HAD FORFEITED HER CONFIDENCE,
AND ABOUT THE THIRD TIME OF THEIR MEETING, SHE HEARD ALL MRS. ELTON'S
KNIGHT-ERRANTRY ON THE SUBJECT.--

"JANE FAIRFAX IS ABSOLUTELY CHARMING, MISS WOODHOUSE.--I QUITE
RAVE ABOUT JANE FAIRFAX.--A SWEET, INTERESTING CREATURE.  SO MILD
AND LADYLIKE--AND WITH SUCH TALENTS!--I ASSURE YOU I THINK SHE
HAS VERY EXTRAORDINARY TALENTS.  I DO NOT SCRUPLE TO SAY THAT SHE
PLAYS EXTREMELY WELL.  I KNOW ENOUGH OF MUSIC TO SPEAK DECIDEDLY
ON THAT POINT.  OH! SHE IS ABSOLUTELY CHARMING!  YOU WILL LAUGH AT
MY WARMTH--BUT, UPON MY WORD, I TALK OF NOTHING BUT JANE FAIRFAX.--
AND HER SITUATION IS SO CALCULATED TO AFFECT ONE!--MISS WOODHOUSE,
WE MUST EXERT OURSELVES AND ENDEAVOUR TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER.
WE MUST BRING HER FORWARD.  SUCH TALENT AS HERS MUST NOT BE SUFFERED
TO REMAIN UNKNOWN.--I DARE SAY YOU HAVE HEARD THOSE CHARMING LINES OF
THE POET,

        `FULL MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN,
          `AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR.'

WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO BE VERIFIED IN SWEET JANE FAIRFAX."

"I CANNOT THINK THERE IS ANY DANGER OF IT," WAS EMMA'S CALM ANSWER--
"AND WHEN YOU ARE BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH MISS FAIRFAX'S SITUATION
AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HER HOME HAS BEEN, WITH COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL,
I HAVE NO IDEA THAT YOU WILL SUPPOSE HER TALENTS CAN BE UNKNOWN."

"OH! BUT DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, SHE IS NOW IN SUCH RETIREMENT,
SUCH OBSCURITY, SO THROWN AWAY.--WHATEVER ADVANTAGES SHE MAY HAVE
ENJOYED WITH THE CAMPBELLS ARE SO PALPABLY AT AN END!  AND I THINK
SHE FEELS IT.  I AM SURE SHE DOES.  SHE IS VERY TIMID AND SILENT.
ONE CAN SEE THAT SHE FEELS THE WANT OF ENCOURAGEMENT.  I LIKE HER
THE BETTER FOR IT.  I MUST CONFESS IT IS A RECOMMENDATION TO ME.
I AM A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR TIMIDITY--AND I AM SURE ONE DOES
NOT OFTEN MEET WITH IT.--BUT IN THOSE WHO ARE AT ALL INFERIOR,
IT IS EXTREMELY PREPOSSESSING.  OH!  I ASSURE YOU, JANE FAIRFAX
IS A VERY DELIGHTFUL CHARACTER, AND INTERESTS ME MORE THAN I
CAN EXPRESS."

"YOU APPEAR TO FEEL A GREAT DEAL--BUT I AM NOT AWARE HOW YOU OR ANY
OF MISS FAIRFAX'S ACQUAINTANCE HERE, ANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE KNOWN
HER LONGER THAN YOURSELF, CAN SHEW HER ANY OTHER ATTENTION THAN"--

"MY DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, A VAST DEAL MAY BE DONE BY THOSE WHO DARE
TO ACT.  YOU AND I NEED NOT BE AFRAID.  IF _WE_ SET THE EXAMPLE,
MANY WILL FOLLOW IT AS FAR AS THEY CAN; THOUGH ALL HAVE NOT
OUR SITUATIONS.  _WE_ HAVE CARRIAGES TO FETCH AND CONVEY HER HOME,
AND _WE_ LIVE IN A STYLE WHICH COULD NOT MAKE THE ADDITION OF
JANE FAIRFAX, AT ANY TIME, THE LEAST INCONVENIENT.--I SHOULD BE
EXTREMELY DISPLEASED IF WRIGHT WERE TO SEND US UP SUCH A DINNER,
AS COULD MAKE ME REGRET HAVING ASKED _MORE_ THAN JANE FAIRFAX
TO PARTAKE OF IT.  I HAVE NO IDEA OF THAT SORT OF THING.  IT IS
NOT LIKELY THAT I _SHOULD_, CONSIDERING WHAT I HAVE BEEN USED TO.
MY GREATEST DANGER, PERHAPS, IN HOUSEKEEPING, MAY BE QUITE THE
OTHER WAY, IN DOING TOO MUCH, AND BEING TOO CARELESS OF EXPENSE.
MAPLE GROVE WILL PROBABLY BE MY MODEL MORE THAN IT OUGHT TO BE--
FOR WE DO NOT AT ALL AFFECT TO EQUAL MY BROTHER, MR. SUCKLING,
IN INCOME.--HOWEVER, MY RESOLUTION IS TAKEN AS TO NOTICING JANE FAIRFAX.--
I SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE HER VERY OFTEN AT MY HOUSE, SHALL INTRODUCE
HER WHEREVER I CAN, SHALL HAVE MUSICAL PARTIES TO DRAW OUT HER TALENTS,
AND SHALL BE CONSTANTLY ON THE WATCH FOR AN ELIGIBLE SITUATION.
MY ACQUAINTANCE IS SO VERY EXTENSIVE, THAT I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT
OF HEARING OF SOMETHING TO SUIT HER SHORTLY.--I SHALL INTRODUCE HER,
OF COURSE, VERY PARTICULARLY TO MY BROTHER AND SISTER WHEN THEY COME
TO US.  I AM SURE THEY WILL LIKE HER EXTREMELY; AND WHEN SHE GETS
A LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH THEM, HER FEARS WILL COMPLETELY WEAR OFF,
FOR THERE REALLY IS NOTHING IN THE MANNERS OF EITHER BUT WHAT IS
HIGHLY CONCILIATING.--I SHALL HAVE HER VERY OFTEN INDEED WHILE THEY
ARE WITH ME, AND I DARE SAY WE SHALL SOMETIMES FIND A SEAT FOR HER IN
THE BAROUCHE-LANDAU IN SOME OF OUR EXPLORING PARTIES."

"POOR JANE FAIRFAX!"--THOUGHT EMMA.--"YOU HAVE NOT DESERVED THIS.
YOU MAY HAVE DONE WRONG WITH REGARD TO MR. DIXON, BUT THIS IS A
PUNISHMENT BEYOND WHAT YOU CAN HAVE MERITED!--THE KINDNESS AND PROTECTION
OF MRS. ELTON!--`JANE FAIRFAX AND JANE FAIRFAX.'  HEAVENS!  LET ME
NOT SUPPOSE THAT SHE DARES GO ABOUT, EMMA WOODHOUSE-ING ME!--
BUT UPON MY HONOUR, THERE SEEMS NO LIMITS TO THE LICENTIOUSNESS
OF THAT WOMAN'S TONGUE!"

EMMA HAD NOT TO LISTEN TO SUCH PARADINGS AGAIN--TO ANY SO EXCLUSIVELY
ADDRESSED TO HERSELF--SO DISGUSTINGLY DECORATED WITH A "DEAR MISS
WOODHOUSE."  THE CHANGE ON MRS. ELTON'S SIDE SOON AFTERWARDS APPEARED,
AND SHE WAS LEFT IN PEACE--NEITHER FORCED TO BE THE VERY PARTICULAR
FRIEND OF MRS. ELTON, NOR, UNDER MRS. ELTON'S GUIDANCE, THE VERY
ACTIVE PATRONESS OF JANE FAIRFAX, AND ONLY SHARING WITH OTHERS IN A
GENERAL WAY, IN KNOWING WHAT WAS FELT, WHAT WAS MEDITATED, WHAT WAS DONE.

SHE LOOKED ON WITH SOME AMUSEMENT.--MISS BATES'S GRATITUDE FOR
MRS. ELTON'S ATTENTIONS TO JANE WAS IN THE FIRST STYLE OF GUILELESS
SIMPLICITY AND WARMTH.  SHE WAS QUITE ONE OF HER WORTHIES--
THE MOST AMIABLE, AFFABLE, DELIGHTFUL WOMAN--JUST AS ACCOMPLISHED
AND CONDESCENDING AS MRS. ELTON MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED.
EMMA'S ONLY SURPRIZE WAS THAT JANE FAIRFAX SHOULD ACCEPT
THOSE ATTENTIONS AND TOLERATE MRS. ELTON AS SHE SEEMED TO DO.
SHE HEARD OF HER WALKING WITH THE ELTONS, SITTING WITH THE ELTONS,
SPENDING A DAY WITH THE ELTONS!  THIS WAS ASTONISHING!--SHE COULD NOT
HAVE BELIEVED IT POSSIBLE THAT THE TASTE OR THE PRIDE OF MISS FAIRFAX
COULD ENDURE SUCH SOCIETY AND FRIENDSHIP AS THE VICARAGE HAD TO OFFER.

"SHE IS A RIDDLE, QUITE A RIDDLE!" SAID SHE.--"TO CHUSE TO REMAIN
HERE MONTH AFTER MONTH, UNDER PRIVATIONS OF EVERY SORT!  AND NOW
TO CHUSE THE MORTIFICATION OF MRS. ELTON'S NOTICE AND THE PENURY
OF HER CONVERSATION, RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE SUPERIOR COMPANIONS
WHO HAVE ALWAYS LOVED HER WITH SUCH REAL, GENEROUS AFFECTION."

JANE HAD COME TO HIGHBURY PROFESSEDLY FOR THREE MONTHS; THE CAMPBELLS
WERE GONE TO IRELAND FOR THREE MONTHS; BUT NOW THE CAMPBELLS
HAD PROMISED THEIR DAUGHTER TO STAY AT LEAST TILL MIDSUMMER,
AND FRESH INVITATIONS HAD ARRIVED FOR HER TO JOIN THEM THERE.
ACCORDING TO MISS BATES--IT ALL CAME FROM HER--MRS. DIXON HAD
WRITTEN MOST PRESSINGLY.  WOULD JANE BUT GO, MEANS WERE TO BE FOUND,
SERVANTS SENT, FRIENDS CONTRIVED--NO TRAVELLING DIFFICULTY ALLOWED
TO EXIST; BUT STILL SHE HAD DECLINED IT!

"SHE MUST HAVE SOME MOTIVE, MORE POWERFUL THAN APPEARS, FOR REFUSING
THIS INVITATION," WAS EMMA'S CONCLUSION.  "SHE MUST BE UNDER SOME
SORT OF PENANCE, INFLICTED EITHER BY THE CAMPBELLS OR HERSELF.
THERE IS GREAT FEAR, GREAT CAUTION, GREAT RESOLUTION SOMEWHERE.--
SHE IS _NOT_ TO BE WITH THE _DIXONS_.  THE DECREE IS ISSUED BY SOMEBODY.
BUT WHY MUST SHE CONSENT TO BE WITH THE ELTONS?--HERE IS QUITE A
SEPARATE PUZZLE."

UPON HER SPEAKING HER WONDER ALOUD ON THAT PART OF THE SUBJECT,
BEFORE THE FEW WHO KNEW HER OPINION OF MRS. ELTON, MRS. WESTON
VENTURED THIS APOLOGY FOR JANE.

"WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT SHE HAS ANY GREAT ENJOYMENT AT THE VICARAGE,
MY DEAR EMMA--BUT IT IS BETTER THAN BEING ALWAYS AT HOME.
HER AUNT IS A GOOD CREATURE, BUT, AS A CONSTANT COMPANION,
MUST BE VERY TIRESOME.  WE MUST CONSIDER WHAT MISS FAIRFAX QUITS,
BEFORE WE CONDEMN HER TASTE FOR WHAT SHE GOES TO."

"YOU ARE RIGHT, MRS. WESTON," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY WARMLY, "MISS FAIRFAX
IS AS CAPABLE AS ANY OF US OF FORMING A JUST OPINION OF MRS. ELTON.
COULD SHE HAVE CHOSEN WITH WHOM TO ASSOCIATE, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE
CHOSEN HER.  BUT (WITH A REPROACHFUL SMILE AT EMMA) SHE RECEIVES
ATTENTIONS FROM MRS. ELTON, WHICH NOBODY ELSE PAYS HER."

EMMA FELT THAT MRS. WESTON WAS GIVING HER A MOMENTARY GLANCE;
AND SHE WAS HERSELF STRUCK BY HIS WARMTH.  WITH A FAINT BLUSH,
SHE PRESENTLY REPLIED,

"SUCH ATTENTIONS AS MRS. ELTON'S, I SHOULD HAVE IMAGINED,
WOULD RATHER DISGUST THAN GRATIFY MISS FAIRFAX.  MRS. ELTON'S
INVITATIONS I SHOULD HAVE IMAGINED ANY THING BUT INVITING."

"I SHOULD NOT WONDER," SAID MRS. WESTON, "IF MISS FAIRFAX WERE TO HAVE
BEEN DRAWN ON BEYOND HER OWN INCLINATION, BY HER AUNT'S EAGERNESS
IN ACCEPTING MRS. ELTON'S CIVILITIES FOR HER.  POOR MISS BATES MAY
VERY LIKELY HAVE COMMITTED HER NIECE AND HURRIED HER INTO A GREATER
APPEARANCE OF INTIMACY THAN HER OWN GOOD SENSE WOULD HAVE DICTATED,
IN SPITE OF THE VERY NATURAL WISH OF A LITTLE CHANGE."

BOTH FELT RATHER ANXIOUS TO HEAR HIM SPEAK AGAIN; AND AFTER A FEW
MINUTES SILENCE, HE SAID,

"ANOTHER THING MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION TOO--MRS. ELTON
DOES NOT TALK _TO_ MISS FAIRFAX AS SHE SPEAKS _OF_ HER.  WE ALL KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRONOUNS HE OR SHE AND THOU, THE PLAINEST
SPOKEN AMONGST US; WE ALL FEEL THE INFLUENCE OF A SOMETHING BEYOND
COMMON CIVILITY IN OUR PERSONAL INTERCOURSE WITH EACH OTHER--
A SOMETHING MORE EARLY IMPLANTED.  WE CANNOT GIVE ANY BODY THE
DISAGREEABLE HINTS THAT WE MAY HAVE BEEN VERY FULL OF THE HOUR BEFORE.
WE FEEL THINGS DIFFERENTLY.  AND BESIDES THE OPERATION OF THIS,
AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE, YOU MAY BE SURE THAT MISS FAIRFAX AWES
MRS. ELTON BY HER SUPERIORITY BOTH OF MIND AND MANNER; AND THAT,
FACE TO FACE, MRS. ELTON TREATS HER WITH ALL THE RESPECT WHICH SHE
HAS A CLAIM TO.  SUCH A WOMAN AS JANE FAIRFAX PROBABLY NEVER FELL
IN MRS. ELTON'S WAY BEFORE--AND NO DEGREE OF VANITY CAN PREVENT
HER ACKNOWLEDGING HER OWN COMPARATIVE LITTLENESS IN ACTION, IF NOT
IN CONSCIOUSNESS."

"I KNOW HOW HIGHLY YOU THINK OF JANE FAIRFAX," SAID EMMA.
LITTLE HENRY WAS IN HER THOUGHTS, AND A MIXTURE OF ALARM AND DELICACY
MADE HER IRRESOLUTE WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

"YES," HE REPLIED, "ANY BODY MAY KNOW HOW HIGHLY I THINK OF HER."

"AND YET," SAID EMMA, BEGINNING HASTILY AND WITH AN ARCH LOOK,
BUT SOON STOPPING--IT WAS BETTER, HOWEVER, TO KNOW THE WORST AT ONCE--
SHE HURRIED ON--"AND YET, PERHAPS, YOU MAY HARDLY BE AWARE YOURSELF
HOW HIGHLY IT IS.  THE EXTENT OF YOUR ADMIRATION MAY TAKE YOU BY
SURPRIZE SOME DAY OR OTHER."

MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS HARD AT WORK UPON THE LOWER BUTTONS OF HIS THICK
LEATHER GAITERS, AND EITHER THE EXERTION OF GETTING THEM TOGETHER,
OR SOME OTHER CAUSE, BROUGHT THE COLOUR INTO HIS FACE, AS HE ANSWERED,

"OH! ARE YOU THERE?--BUT YOU ARE MISERABLY BEHINDHAND.  MR. COLE
GAVE ME A HINT OF IT SIX WEEKS AGO."

HE STOPPED.--EMMA FELT HER FOOT PRESSED BY MRS. WESTON, AND DID
NOT HERSELF KNOW WHAT TO THINK.  IN A MOMENT HE WENT ON--

"THAT WILL NEVER BE, HOWEVER, I CAN ASSURE YOU.  MISS FAIRFAX,
I DARE SAY, WOULD NOT HAVE ME IF I WERE TO ASK HER--AND I AM VERY
SURE I SHALL NEVER ASK HER."

EMMA RETURNED HER FRIEND'S PRESSURE WITH INTEREST; AND WAS PLEASED
ENOUGH TO EXCLAIM,

"YOU ARE NOT VAIN, MR. KNIGHTLEY.  I WILL SAY THAT FOR YOU."

HE SEEMED HARDLY TO HEAR HER; HE WAS THOUGHTFUL--AND IN A MANNER
WHICH SHEWED HIM NOT PLEASED, SOON AFTERWARDS SAID,

"SO YOU HAVE BEEN SETTLING THAT I SHOULD MARRY JANE FAIRFAX?"

"NO INDEED I HAVE NOT.  YOU HAVE SCOLDED ME TOO MUCH FOR MATCH-MAKING,
FOR ME TO PRESUME TO TAKE SUCH A LIBERTY WITH YOU.  WHAT I SAID
JUST NOW, MEANT NOTHING.  ONE SAYS THOSE SORT OF THINGS, OF COURSE,
WITHOUT ANY IDEA OF A SERIOUS MEANING.  OH! NO, UPON MY WORD I HAVE NOT
THE SMALLEST WISH FOR YOUR MARRYING JANE FAIRFAX OR JANE ANY BODY.
YOU WOULD NOT COME IN AND SIT WITH US IN THIS COMFORTABLE WAY,
IF YOU WERE MARRIED."

MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS THOUGHTFUL AGAIN.  THE RESULT OF HIS REVERIE WAS,
"NO, EMMA, I DO NOT THINK THE EXTENT OF MY ADMIRATION FOR HER WILL
EVER TAKE ME BY SURPRIZE.--I NEVER HAD A THOUGHT OF HER IN THAT WAY,
I ASSURE YOU."  AND SOON AFTERWARDS, "JANE FAIRFAX IS A VERY CHARMING
YOUNG WOMAN--BUT NOT EVEN JANE FAIRFAX IS PERFECT.  SHE HAS A FAULT.
SHE HAS NOT THE OPEN TEMPER WHICH A MAN WOULD WISH FOR IN A WIFE."

EMMA COULD NOT BUT REJOICE TO HEAR THAT SHE HAD A FAULT.
"WELL," SAID SHE, "AND YOU SOON SILENCED MR. COLE, I SUPPOSE?"

"YES, VERY SOON.  HE GAVE ME A QUIET HINT; I TOLD HIM HE WAS MISTAKEN;
HE ASKED MY PARDON AND SAID NO MORE.  COLE DOES NOT WANT TO BE WISER
OR WITTIER THAN HIS NEIGHBOURS."

"IN THAT RESPECT HOW UNLIKE DEAR MRS. ELTON, WHO WANTS TO BE WISER
AND WITTIER THAN ALL THE WORLD!  I WONDER HOW SHE SPEAKS OF THE COLES--
WHAT SHE CALLS THEM!  HOW CAN SHE FIND ANY APPELLATION FOR THEM,
DEEP ENOUGH IN FAMILIAR VULGARITY?  SHE CALLS YOU, KNIGHTLEY--WHAT CAN
SHE DO FOR MR. COLE?  AND SO I AM NOT TO BE SURPRIZED THAT JANE
FAIRFAX ACCEPTS HER CIVILITIES AND CONSENTS TO BE WITH HER.
MRS. WESTON, YOUR ARGUMENT WEIGHS MOST WITH ME.  I CAN MUCH MORE
READILY ENTER INTO THE TEMPTATION OF GETTING AWAY FROM MISS BATES,
THAN I CAN BELIEVE IN THE TRIUMPH OF MISS FAIRFAX'S MIND OVER
MRS. ELTON.  I HAVE NO FAITH IN MRS. ELTON'S ACKNOWLEDGING HERSELF
THE INFERIOR IN THOUGHT, WORD, OR DEED; OR IN HER BEING UNDER ANY
RESTRAINT BEYOND HER OWN SCANTY RULE OF GOOD-BREEDING. I CANNOT
IMAGINE THAT SHE WILL NOT BE CONTINUALLY INSULTING HER VISITOR
WITH PRAISE, ENCOURAGEMENT, AND OFFERS OF SERVICE; THAT SHE WILL NOT BE
CONTINUALLY DETAILING HER MAGNIFICENT INTENTIONS, FROM THE PROCURING
HER A PERMANENT SITUATION TO THE INCLUDING HER IN THOSE DELIGHTFUL
EXPLORING PARTIES WHICH ARE TO TAKE PLACE IN THE BAROUCHE-LANDAU."

"JANE FAIRFAX HAS FEELING," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY--"I DO NOT
ACCUSE HER OF WANT OF FEELING.  HER SENSIBILITIES, I SUSPECT,
ARE STRONG--AND HER TEMPER EXCELLENT IN ITS POWER OF FORBEARANCE,
PATIENCE, SELF-CONTROUL; BUT IT WANTS OPENNESS.  SHE IS RESERVED,
MORE RESERVED, I THINK, THAN SHE USED TO BE--AND I LOVE AN
OPEN TEMPER.  NO--TILL COLE ALLUDED TO MY SUPPOSED ATTACHMENT,
IT HAD NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD.  I SAW JANE FAIRFAX AND CONVERSED WITH
HER, WITH ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE ALWAYS--BUT WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND."

"WELL, MRS. WESTON," SAID EMMA TRIUMPHANTLY WHEN HE LEFT THEM,
"WHAT DO YOU SAY NOW TO MR. KNIGHTLEY'S MARRYING JANE FAIRFAX?"

"WHY, REALLY, DEAR EMMA, I SAY THAT HE IS SO VERY MUCH OCCUPIED
BY THE IDEA OF _NOT_ BEING IN LOVE WITH HER, THAT I SHOULD NOT WONDER
IF IT WERE TO END IN HIS BEING SO AT LAST.  DO NOT BEAT ME."



CHAPTER XVI


EVERY BODY IN AND ABOUT HIGHBURY WHO HAD EVER VISITED MR. ELTON,
WAS DISPOSED TO PAY HIM ATTENTION ON HIS MARRIAGE.  DINNER-PARTIES AND
EVENING-PARTIES WERE MADE FOR HIM AND HIS LADY; AND INVITATIONS
FLOWED IN SO FAST THAT SHE HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF APPREHENDING
THEY WERE NEVER TO HAVE A DISENGAGED DAY.

"I SEE HOW IT IS," SAID SHE.  "I SEE WHAT A LIFE I AM TO LEAD
AMONG YOU.  UPON MY WORD WE SHALL BE ABSOLUTELY DISSIPATED.
WE REALLY SEEM QUITE THE FASHION.  IF THIS IS LIVING IN THE COUNTRY,
IT IS NOTHING VERY FORMIDABLE.  FROM MONDAY NEXT TO SATURDAY,
I ASSURE YOU WE HAVE NOT A DISENGAGED DAY!--A WOMAN WITH FEWER
RESOURCES THAN I HAVE, NEED NOT HAVE BEEN AT A LOSS."

NO INVITATION CAME AMISS TO HER.  HER BATH HABITS MADE EVENING-PARTIES
PERFECTLY NATURAL TO HER, AND MAPLE GROVE HAD GIVEN HER A TASTE
FOR DINNERS.  SHE WAS A LITTLE SHOCKED AT THE WANT OF TWO
DRAWING ROOMS, AT THE POOR ATTEMPT AT ROUT-CAKES, AND THERE BEING
NO ICE IN THE HIGHBURY CARD-PARTIES. MRS. BATES, MRS. PERRY,
MRS. GODDARD AND OTHERS, WERE A GOOD DEAL BEHIND-HAND IN KNOWLEDGE
OF THE WORLD, BUT SHE WOULD SOON SHEW THEM HOW EVERY THING OUGHT
TO BE ARRANGED.  IN THE COURSE OF THE SPRING SHE MUST RETURN THEIR
CIVILITIES BY ONE VERY SUPERIOR PARTY--IN WHICH HER CARD-TABLES
SHOULD BE SET OUT WITH THEIR SEPARATE CANDLES AND UNBROKEN PACKS
IN THE TRUE STYLE--AND MORE WAITERS ENGAGED FOR THE EVENING
THAN THEIR OWN ESTABLISHMENT COULD FURNISH, TO CARRY ROUND
THE REFRESHMENTS AT EXACTLY THE PROPER HOUR, AND IN THE PROPER ORDER.

EMMA, IN THE MEANWHILE, COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT A DINNER
AT HARTFIELD FOR THE ELTONS.  THEY MUST NOT DO LESS THAN OTHERS,
OR SHE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO ODIOUS SUSPICIONS, AND IMAGINED CAPABLE
OF PITIFUL RESENTMENT.  A DINNER THERE MUST BE.  AFTER EMMA HAD
TALKED ABOUT IT FOR TEN MINUTES, MR. WOODHOUSE FELT NO UNWILLINGNESS,
AND ONLY MADE THE USUAL STIPULATION OF NOT SITTING AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE TABLE HIMSELF, WITH THE USUAL REGULAR DIFFICULTY OF DECIDING
WHO SHOULD DO IT FOR HIM.

THE PERSONS TO BE INVITED, REQUIRED LITTLE THOUGHT.  BESIDES THE ELTONS,
IT MUST BE THE WESTONS AND MR. KNIGHTLEY; SO FAR IT WAS ALL OF COURSE--
AND IT WAS HARDLY LESS INEVITABLE THAT POOR LITTLE HARRIET MUST
BE ASKED TO MAKE THE EIGHTH:--BUT THIS INVITATION WAS NOT GIVEN
WITH EQUAL SATISFACTION, AND ON MANY ACCOUNTS EMMA WAS PARTICULARLY
PLEASED BY HARRIET'S BEGGING TO BE ALLOWED TO DECLINE IT.
"SHE WOULD RATHER NOT BE IN HIS COMPANY MORE THAN SHE COULD HELP.
SHE WAS NOT YET QUITE ABLE TO SEE HIM AND HIS CHARMING HAPPY
WIFE TOGETHER, WITHOUT FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE.  IF MISS WOODHOUSE
WOULD NOT BE DISPLEASED, SHE WOULD RATHER STAY AT HOME."
IT WAS PRECISELY WHAT EMMA WOULD HAVE WISHED, HAD SHE DEEMED IT
POSSIBLE ENOUGH FOR WISHING.  SHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE FORTITUDE
OF HER LITTLE FRIEND--FOR FORTITUDE SHE KNEW IT WAS IN HER TO GIVE
UP BEING IN COMPANY AND STAY AT HOME; AND SHE COULD NOW INVITE THE
VERY PERSON WHOM SHE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE THE EIGHTH, JANE FAIRFAX.--
SINCE HER LAST CONVERSATION WITH MRS. WESTON AND MR. KNIGHTLEY,
SHE WAS MORE CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN ABOUT JANE FAIRFAX THAN SHE HAD
OFTEN BEEN.--MR. KNIGHTLEY'S WORDS DWELT WITH HER.  HE HAD SAID
THAT JANE FAIRFAX RECEIVED ATTENTIONS FROM MRS. ELTON WHICH NOBODY
ELSE PAID HER.

"THIS IS VERY TRUE," SAID SHE, "AT LEAST AS FAR AS RELATES TO ME,
WHICH WAS ALL THAT WAS MEANT--AND IT IS VERY SHAMEFUL.--OF THE SAME AGE--
AND ALWAYS KNOWING HER--I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MORE HER FRIEND.--
SHE WILL NEVER LIKE ME NOW.  I HAVE NEGLECTED HER TOO LONG.  BUT I
WILL SHEW HER GREATER ATTENTION THAN I HAVE DONE."

EVERY INVITATION WAS SUCCESSFUL.  THEY WERE ALL DISENGAGED AND ALL HAPPY.--
THE PREPARATORY INTEREST OF THIS DINNER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT YET OVER.
A CIRCUMSTANCE RATHER UNLUCKY OCCURRED.  THE TWO ELDEST LITTLE
KNIGHTLEYS WERE ENGAGED TO PAY THEIR GRANDPAPA AND AUNT A VISIT OF
SOME WEEKS IN THE SPRING, AND THEIR PAPA NOW PROPOSED BRINGING THEM,
AND STAYING ONE WHOLE DAY AT HARTFIELD--WHICH ONE DAY WOULD BE
THE VERY DAY OF THIS PARTY.--HIS PROFESSIONAL ENGAGEMENTS DID
NOT ALLOW OF HIS BEING PUT OFF, BUT BOTH FATHER AND DAUGHTER WERE
DISTURBED BY ITS HAPPENING SO.  MR. WOODHOUSE CONSIDERED EIGHT
PERSONS AT DINNER TOGETHER AS THE UTMOST THAT HIS NERVES COULD BEAR--
AND HERE WOULD BE A NINTH--AND EMMA APPREHENDED THAT IT WOULD
BE A NINTH VERY MUCH OUT OF HUMOUR AT NOT BEING ABLE TO COME EVEN
TO HARTFIELD FOR FORTY-EIGHT HOURS WITHOUT FALLING IN WITH A DINNER-PARTY.

SHE COMFORTED HER FATHER BETTER THAN SHE COULD COMFORT HERSELF,
BY REPRESENTING THAT THOUGH HE CERTAINLY WOULD MAKE THEM NINE,
YET HE ALWAYS SAID SO LITTLE, THAT THE INCREASE OF NOISE WOULD BE
VERY IMMATERIAL.  SHE THOUGHT IT IN REALITY A SAD EXCHANGE FOR HERSELF,
TO HAVE HIM WITH HIS GRAVE LOOKS AND RELUCTANT CONVERSATION OPPOSED
TO HER INSTEAD OF HIS BROTHER.

THE EVENT WAS MORE FAVOURABLE TO MR. WOODHOUSE THAN TO EMMA.
JOHN KNIGHTLEY CAME; BUT MR. WESTON WAS UNEXPECTEDLY SUMMONED TO TOWN
AND MUST BE ABSENT ON THE VERY DAY.  HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO JOIN THEM
IN THE EVENING, BUT CERTAINLY NOT TO DINNER.  MR. WOODHOUSE WAS QUITE
AT EASE; AND THE SEEING HIM SO, WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE LITTLE BOYS
AND THE PHILOSOPHIC COMPOSURE OF HER BROTHER ON HEARING HIS FATE,
REMOVED THE CHIEF OF EVEN EMMA'S VEXATION.

THE DAY CAME, THE PARTY WERE PUNCTUALLY ASSEMBLED, AND MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY
SEEMED EARLY TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO THE BUSINESS OF BEING AGREEABLE.
INSTEAD OF DRAWING HIS BROTHER OFF TO A WINDOW WHILE THEY WAITED
FOR DINNER, HE WAS TALKING TO MISS FAIRFAX.  MRS. ELTON, AS ELEGANT
AS LACE AND PEARLS COULD MAKE HER, HE LOOKED AT IN SILENCE--
WANTING ONLY TO OBSERVE ENOUGH FOR ISABELLA'S INFORMATION--BUT MISS
FAIRFAX WAS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND A QUIET GIRL, AND HE COULD
TALK TO HER.  HE HAD MET HER BEFORE BREAKFAST AS HE WAS RETURNING
FROM A WALK WITH HIS LITTLE BOYS, WHEN IT HAD BEEN JUST BEGINNING
TO RAIN.  IT WAS NATURAL TO HAVE SOME CIVIL HOPES ON THE SUBJECT,
AND HE SAID,

"I HOPE YOU DID NOT VENTURE FAR, MISS FAIRFAX, THIS MORNING, OR I
AM SURE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WET.--WE SCARCELY GOT HOME IN TIME.
I HOPE YOU TURNED DIRECTLY."

"I WENT ONLY TO THE POST-OFFICE," SAID SHE, "AND REACHED HOME
BEFORE THE RAIN WAS MUCH.  IT IS MY DAILY ERRAND.  I ALWAYS FETCH
THE LETTERS WHEN I AM HERE.  IT SAVES TROUBLE, AND IS A SOMETHING
TO GET ME OUT.  A WALK BEFORE BREAKFAST DOES ME GOOD."

"NOT A WALK IN THE RAIN, I SHOULD IMAGINE."

"NO, BUT IT DID NOT ABSOLUTELY RAIN WHEN I SET OUT."

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY SMILED, AND REPLIED,

"THAT IS TO SAY, YOU CHOSE TO HAVE YOUR WALK, FOR YOU WERE NOT SIX
YARDS FROM YOUR OWN DOOR WHEN I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING YOU;
AND HENRY AND JOHN HAD SEEN MORE DROPS THAN THEY COULD COUNT LONG BEFORE.
THE POST-OFFICE HAS A GREAT CHARM AT ONE PERIOD OF OUR LIVES.
WHEN YOU HAVE LIVED TO MY AGE, YOU WILL BEGIN TO THINK LETTERS ARE
NEVER WORTH GOING THROUGH THE RAIN FOR."

THERE WAS A LITTLE BLUSH, AND THEN THIS ANSWER,

"I MUST NOT HOPE TO BE EVER SITUATED AS YOU ARE, IN THE MIDST OF
EVERY DEAREST CONNEXION, AND THEREFORE I CANNOT EXPECT THAT SIMPLY
GROWING OLDER SHOULD MAKE ME INDIFFERENT ABOUT LETTERS."

"INDIFFERENT!  OH! NO--I NEVER CONCEIVED YOU COULD BECOME INDIFFERENT.
LETTERS ARE NO MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE; THEY ARE GENERALLY A VERY
POSITIVE CURSE."

"YOU ARE SPEAKING OF LETTERS OF BUSINESS; MINE ARE LETTERS
OF FRIENDSHIP."

"I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THEM THE WORST OF THE TWO," REPLIED HE COOLLY.
"BUSINESS, YOU KNOW, MAY BRING MONEY, BUT FRIENDSHIP HARDLY
EVER DOES."

"AH! YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS NOW.  I KNOW MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY TOO WELL--
I AM VERY SURE HE UNDERSTANDS THE VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP AS WELL AS
ANY BODY.  I CAN EASILY BELIEVE THAT LETTERS ARE VERY LITTLE TO YOU,
MUCH LESS THAN TO ME, BUT IT IS NOT YOUR BEING TEN YEARS OLDER THAN
MYSELF WHICH MAKES THE DIFFERENCE, IT IS NOT AGE, BUT SITUATION.
YOU HAVE EVERY BODY DEAREST TO YOU ALWAYS AT HAND, I, PROBABLY,
NEVER SHALL AGAIN; AND THEREFORE TILL I HAVE OUTLIVED ALL MY AFFECTIONS,
A POST-OFFICE, I THINK, MUST ALWAYS HAVE POWER TO DRAW ME OUT,
IN WORSE WEATHER THAN TO-DAY."

"WHEN I TALKED OF YOUR BEING ALTERED BY TIME, BY THE PROGRESS OF YEARS,"
SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY, "I MEANT TO IMPLY THE CHANGE OF SITUATION
WHICH TIME USUALLY BRINGS.  I CONSIDER ONE AS INCLUDING THE OTHER.
TIME WILL GENERALLY LESSEN THE INTEREST OF EVERY ATTACHMENT NOT WITHIN
THE DAILY CIRCLE--BUT THAT IS NOT THE CHANGE I HAD IN VIEW FOR YOU.
AS AN OLD FRIEND, YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO HOPE, MISS FAIRFAX, THAT TEN
YEARS HENCE YOU MAY HAVE AS MANY CONCENTRATED OBJECTS AS I HAVE."

IT WAS KINDLY SAID, AND VERY FAR FROM GIVING OFFENCE.  A PLEASANT
"THANK YOU" SEEMED MEANT TO LAUGH IT OFF, BUT A BLUSH, A QUIVERING LIP,
A TEAR IN THE EYE, SHEWED THAT IT WAS FELT BEYOND A LAUGH.
HER ATTENTION WAS NOW CLAIMED BY MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO BEING,
ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM ON SUCH OCCASIONS, MAKING THE CIRCLE OF
HIS GUESTS, AND PAYING HIS PARTICULAR COMPLIMENTS TO THE LADIES,
WAS ENDING WITH HER--AND WITH ALL HIS MILDEST URBANITY, SAID,

"I AM VERY SORRY TO HEAR, MISS FAIRFAX, OF YOUR BEING OUT THIS
MORNING IN THE RAIN.  YOUNG LADIES SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.--
YOUNG LADIES ARE DELICATE PLANTS.  THEY SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THEIR
HEALTH AND THEIR COMPLEXION.  MY DEAR, DID YOU CHANGE YOUR STOCKINGS?"

"YES, SIR, I DID INDEED; AND I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED BY YOUR KIND
SOLICITUDE ABOUT ME."

"MY DEAR MISS FAIRFAX, YOUNG LADIES ARE VERY SURE TO BE CARED FOR.--
I HOPE YOUR GOOD GRAND-MAMA AND AUNT ARE WELL.  THEY ARE SOME
OF MY VERY OLD FRIENDS.  I WISH MY HEALTH ALLOWED ME TO BE A
BETTER NEIGHBOUR.  YOU DO US A GREAT DEAL OF HONOUR TO-DAY, I AM SURE.
MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE BOTH HIGHLY SENSIBLE OF YOUR GOODNESS,
AND HAVE THE GREATEST SATISFACTION IN SEEING YOU AT HARTFIELD."

THE KIND-HEARTED, POLITE OLD MAN MIGHT THEN SIT DOWN AND FEEL
THAT HE HAD DONE HIS DUTY, AND MADE EVERY FAIR LADY WELCOME AND EASY.

BY THIS TIME, THE WALK IN THE RAIN HAD REACHED MRS. ELTON,
AND HER REMONSTRANCES NOW OPENED UPON JANE.

"MY DEAR JANE, WHAT IS THIS I HEAR?--GOING TO THE POST-OFFICE
IN THE RAIN!--THIS MUST NOT BE, I ASSURE YOU.--YOU SAD GIRL,
HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING?--IT IS A SIGN I WAS NOT THERE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU."

JANE VERY PATIENTLY ASSURED HER THAT SHE HAD NOT CAUGHT ANY COLD.

"OH! DO NOT TELL _ME_.  YOU REALLY ARE A VERY SAD GIRL, AND DO NOT
KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.--TO THE POST-OFFICE INDEED!
MRS. WESTON, DID YOU EVER HEAR THE LIKE?  YOU AND I MUST POSITIVELY
EXERT OUR AUTHORITY."

"MY ADVICE," SAID MRS. WESTON KINDLY AND PERSUASIVELY, "I CERTAINLY
DO FEEL TEMPTED TO GIVE.  MISS FAIRFAX, YOU MUST NOT RUN SUCH RISKS.--
LIABLE AS YOU HAVE BEEN TO SEVERE COLDS, INDEED YOU OUGHT
TO BE PARTICULARLY CAREFUL, ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR.
THE SPRING I ALWAYS THINK REQUIRES MORE THAN COMMON CARE.
BETTER WAIT AN HOUR OR TWO, OR EVEN HALF A DAY FOR YOUR LETTERS,
THAN RUN THE RISK OF BRINGING ON YOUR COUGH AGAIN.  NOW DO NOT YOU
FEEL THAT YOU HAD?  YES, I AM SURE YOU ARE MUCH TOO REASONABLE.
YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WOULD NOT DO SUCH A THING AGAIN."

"OH! SHE _SHALL_ _NOT_ DO SUCH A THING AGAIN," EAGERLY REJOINED
MRS. ELTON.  "WE WILL NOT ALLOW HER TO DO SUCH A THING AGAIN:"--
AND NODDING SIGNIFICANTLY--"THERE MUST BE SOME ARRANGEMENT MADE,
THERE MUST INDEED.  I SHALL SPEAK TO MR. E. THE MAN WHO FETCHES
OUR LETTERS EVERY MORNING (ONE OF OUR MEN, I FORGET HIS NAME)
SHALL INQUIRE FOR YOURS TOO AND BRING THEM TO YOU.  THAT WILL OBVIATE
ALL DIFFICULTIES YOU KNOW; AND FROM _US_ I REALLY THINK, MY DEAR JANE,
YOU CAN HAVE NO SCRUPLE TO ACCEPT SUCH AN ACCOMMODATION."

"YOU ARE EXTREMELY KIND," SAID JANE; "BUT I CANNOT GIVE UP MY
EARLY WALK.  I AM ADVISED TO BE OUT OF DOORS AS MUCH AS I CAN,
I MUST WALK SOMEWHERE, AND THE POST-OFFICE IS AN OBJECT; AND UPON
MY WORD, I HAVE SCARCELY EVER HAD A BAD MORNING BEFORE."

"MY DEAR JANE, SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT.  THE THING IS DETERMINED,
THAT IS (LAUGHING AFFECTEDLY) AS FAR AS I CAN PRESUME TO DETERMINE
ANY THING WITHOUT THE CONCURRENCE OF MY LORD AND MASTER.  YOU KNOW,
MRS. WESTON, YOU AND I MUST BE CAUTIOUS HOW WE EXPRESS OURSELVES.
BUT I DO FLATTER MYSELF, MY DEAR JANE, THAT MY INFLUENCE IS NOT ENTIRELY
WORN OUT.  IF I MEET WITH NO INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES THEREFORE,
CONSIDER THAT POINT AS SETTLED."

"EXCUSE ME," SAID JANE EARNESTLY, "I CANNOT BY ANY MEANS CONSENT
TO SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT, SO NEEDLESSLY TROUBLESOME TO YOUR SERVANT.
IF THE ERRAND WERE NOT A PLEASURE TO ME, IT COULD BE DONE, AS IT
ALWAYS IS WHEN I AM NOT HERE, BY MY GRANDMAMA'S."

"OH! MY DEAR; BUT SO MUCH AS PATTY HAS TO DO!--AND IT IS A KINDNESS
TO EMPLOY OUR MEN."

JANE LOOKED AS IF SHE DID NOT MEAN TO BE CONQUERED; BUT INSTEAD
OF ANSWERING, SHE BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN TO MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY.

"THE POST-OFFICE IS A WONDERFUL ESTABLISHMENT!" SAID SHE.--
"THE REGULARITY AND DESPATCH OF IT!  IF ONE THINKS OF ALL THAT IT
HAS TO DO, AND ALL THAT IT DOES SO WELL, IT IS REALLY ASTONISHING!"

"IT IS CERTAINLY VERY WELL REGULATED."

"SO SELDOM THAT ANY NEGLIGENCE OR BLUNDER APPEARS!  SO SELDOM
THAT A LETTER, AMONG THE THOUSANDS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY PASSING
ABOUT THE KINGDOM, IS EVEN CARRIED WRONG--AND NOT ONE IN A MILLION,
I SUPPOSE, ACTUALLY LOST!  AND WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE VARIETY
OF HANDS, AND OF BAD HANDS TOO, THAT ARE TO BE DECIPHERED,
IT INCREASES THE WONDER."

"THE CLERKS GROW EXPERT FROM HABIT.--THEY MUST BEGIN WITH SOME
QUICKNESS OF SIGHT AND HAND, AND EXERCISE IMPROVES THEM.  IF YOU
WANT ANY FARTHER EXPLANATION," CONTINUED HE, SMILING, "THEY ARE
PAID FOR IT.  THAT IS THE KEY TO A GREAT DEAL OF CAPACITY.
THE PUBLIC PAYS AND MUST BE SERVED WELL."

THE VARIETIES OF HANDWRITING WERE FARTHER TALKED OF, AND THE USUAL
OBSERVATIONS MADE.

"I HAVE HEARD IT ASSERTED," SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY, "THAT THE SAME
SORT OF HANDWRITING OFTEN PREVAILS IN A FAMILY; AND WHERE THE
SAME MASTER TEACHES, IT IS NATURAL ENOUGH.  BUT FOR THAT REASON,
I SHOULD IMAGINE THE LIKENESS MUST BE CHIEFLY CONFINED TO THE FEMALES,
FOR BOYS HAVE VERY LITTLE TEACHING AFTER AN EARLY AGE, AND SCRAMBLE
INTO ANY HAND THEY CAN GET.  ISABELLA AND EMMA, I THINK, DO WRITE
VERY MUCH ALIKE.  I HAVE NOT ALWAYS KNOWN THEIR WRITING APART."

"YES," SAID HIS BROTHER HESITATINGLY, "THERE IS A LIKENESS.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN--BUT EMMA'S HAND IS THE STRONGEST."

"ISABELLA AND EMMA BOTH WRITE BEAUTIFULLY," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE;
"AND ALWAYS DID.  AND SO DOES POOR MRS. WESTON"--WITH HALF A SIGH
AND HALF A SMILE AT HER.

"I NEVER SAW ANY GENTLEMAN'S HANDWRITING"--EMMA BEGAN, LOOKING ALSO
AT MRS. WESTON; BUT STOPPED, ON PERCEIVING THAT MRS. WESTON WAS
ATTENDING TO SOME ONE ELSE--AND THE PAUSE GAVE HER TIME TO REFLECT,
"NOW, HOW AM I GOING TO INTRODUCE HIM?--AM I UNEQUAL TO SPEAKING
HIS NAME AT ONCE BEFORE ALL THESE PEOPLE?  IS IT NECESSARY
FOR ME TO USE ANY ROUNDABOUT PHRASE?--YOUR YORKSHIRE FRIEND--
YOUR CORRESPONDENT IN YORKSHIRE;--THAT WOULD BE THE WAY, I SUPPOSE,
IF I WERE VERY BAD.--NO, I CAN PRONOUNCE HIS NAME WITHOUT THE
SMALLEST DISTRESS.  I CERTAINLY GET BETTER AND BETTER.--NOW FOR IT."

MRS. WESTON WAS DISENGAGED AND EMMA BEGAN AGAIN--"MR. FRANK CHURCHILL
WRITES ONE OF THE BEST GENTLEMAN'S HANDS I EVER SAW."

"I DO NOT ADMIRE IT," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY.  "IT IS TOO SMALL--
WANTS STRENGTH.  IT IS LIKE A WOMAN'S WRITING."

THIS WAS NOT SUBMITTED TO BY EITHER LADY.  THEY VINDICATED HIM
AGAINST THE BASE ASPERSION.  "NO, IT BY NO MEANS WANTED STRENGTH--
IT WAS NOT A LARGE HAND, BUT VERY CLEAR AND CERTAINLY STRONG.
HAD NOT MRS. WESTON ANY LETTER ABOUT HER TO PRODUCE?"  NO, SHE HAD
HEARD FROM HIM VERY LATELY, BUT HAVING ANSWERED THE LETTER, HAD PUT
IT AWAY.

"IF WE WERE IN THE OTHER ROOM," SAID EMMA, "IF I HAD MY WRITING-DESK,
I AM SURE I COULD PRODUCE A SPECIMEN.  I HAVE A NOTE OF HIS.--
DO NOT YOU REMEMBER, MRS. WESTON, EMPLOYING HIM TO WRITE FOR YOU
ONE DAY?"

"HE CHOSE TO SAY HE WAS EMPLOYED"--

"WELL, WELL, I HAVE THAT NOTE; AND CAN SHEW IT AFTER DINNER
TO CONVINCE MR. KNIGHTLEY."

"OH! WHEN A GALLANT YOUNG MAN, LIKE MR. FRANK CHURCHILL,"
SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY DRYLY, "WRITES TO A FAIR LADY LIKE MISS WOODHOUSE,
HE WILL, OF COURSE, PUT FORTH HIS BEST."

DINNER WAS ON TABLE.--MRS. ELTON, BEFORE SHE COULD BE SPOKEN TO,
WAS READY; AND BEFORE MR. WOODHOUSE HAD REACHED HER WITH HIS REQUEST
TO BE ALLOWED TO HAND HER INTO THE DINING-PARLOUR, WAS SAYING--

"MUST I GO FIRST?  I REALLY AM ASHAMED OF ALWAYS LEADING THE WAY."

JANE'S SOLICITUDE ABOUT FETCHING HER OWN LETTERS HAD NOT ESCAPED EMMA.
SHE HAD HEARD AND SEEN IT ALL; AND FELT SOME CURIOSITY TO KNOW
WHETHER THE WET WALK OF THIS MORNING HAD PRODUCED ANY.  SHE SUSPECTED
THAT IT _HAD_; THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO RESOLUTELY ENCOUNTERED
BUT IN FULL EXPECTATION OF HEARING FROM SOME ONE VERY DEAR,
AND THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN IN VAIN.  SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN AIR
OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN USUAL--A GLOW BOTH OF COMPLEXION AND SPIRITS.

SHE COULD HAVE MADE AN INQUIRY OR TWO, AS TO THE EXPEDITION
AND THE EXPENSE OF THE IRISH MAILS;--IT WAS AT HER TONGUE'S END--
BUT SHE ABSTAINED.  SHE WAS QUITE DETERMINED NOT TO UTTER A WORD
THAT SHOULD HURT JANE FAIRFAX'S FEELINGS; AND THEY FOLLOWED
THE OTHER LADIES OUT OF THE ROOM, ARM IN ARM, WITH AN APPEARANCE
OF GOOD-WILL HIGHLY BECOMING TO THE BEAUTY AND GRACE OF EACH.



CHAPTER XVII


WHEN THE LADIES RETURNED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM AFTER DINNER, EMMA FOUND
IT HARDLY POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THEIR MAKING TWO DISTINCT PARTIES;--
WITH SO MUCH PERSEVERANCE IN JUDGING AND BEHAVING ILL DID MRS. ELTON
ENGROSS JANE FAIRFAX AND SLIGHT HERSELF.  SHE AND MRS. WESTON WERE
OBLIGED TO BE ALMOST ALWAYS EITHER TALKING TOGETHER OR SILENT TOGETHER.
MRS. ELTON LEFT THEM NO CHOICE.  IF JANE REPRESSED HER FOR A
LITTLE TIME, SHE SOON BEGAN AGAIN; AND THOUGH MUCH THAT PASSED
BETWEEN THEM WAS IN A HALF-WHISPER, ESPECIALLY ON MRS. ELTON'S SIDE,
THERE WAS NO AVOIDING A KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS:
THE POST-OFFICE--CATCHING COLD--FETCHING LETTERS--AND FRIENDSHIP,
WERE LONG UNDER DISCUSSION; AND TO THEM SUCCEEDED ONE, WHICH MUST
BE AT LEAST EQUALLY UNPLEASANT TO JANE--INQUIRIES WHETHER SHE HAD
YET HEARD OF ANY SITUATION LIKELY TO SUIT HER, AND PROFESSIONS OF
MRS. ELTON'S MEDITATED ACTIVITY.

"HERE IS APRIL COME!" SAID SHE, "I GET QUITE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU.
JUNE WILL SOON BE HERE."

"BUT I HAVE NEVER FIXED ON JUNE OR ANY OTHER MONTH--MERELY LOOKED
FORWARD TO THE SUMMER IN GENERAL."

"BUT HAVE YOU REALLY HEARD OF NOTHING?"

"I HAVE NOT EVEN MADE ANY INQUIRY; I DO NOT WISH TO MAKE ANY YET."

"OH! MY DEAR, WE CANNOT BEGIN TOO EARLY; YOU ARE NOT AWARE
OF THE DIFFICULTY OF PROCURING EXACTLY THE DESIRABLE THING."

"I NOT AWARE!" SAID JANE, SHAKING HER HEAD; "DEAR MRS. ELTON,
WHO CAN HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AS I HAVE DONE?"

"BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AS I HAVE.  YOU DO NOT
KNOW HOW MANY CANDIDATES THERE ALWAYS ARE FOR THE _FIRST_ SITUATIONS.
I SAW A VAST DEAL OF THAT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ROUND MAPLE GROVE.
A COUSIN OF MR. SUCKLING, MRS. BRAGGE, HAD SUCH AN INFINITY
OF APPLICATIONS; EVERY BODY WAS ANXIOUS TO BE IN HER FAMILY,
FOR SHE MOVES IN THE FIRST CIRCLE.  WAX-CANDLES IN THE SCHOOLROOM!
YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW DESIRABLE!  OF ALL HOUSES IN THE KINGDOM
MRS. BRAGGE'S IS THE ONE I WOULD MOST WISH TO SEE YOU IN."

"COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL ARE TO BE IN TOWN AGAIN BY MIDSUMMER,"
SAID JANE.  "I MUST SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEM; I AM SURE THEY WILL
WANT IT;--AFTERWARDS I MAY PROBABLY BE GLAD TO DISPOSE OF MYSELF.
BUT I WOULD NOT WISH YOU TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF MAKING ANY INQUIRIES
AT PRESENT."

"TROUBLE! AYE, I KNOW YOUR SCRUPLES.  YOU ARE AFRAID OF GIVING
ME TROUBLE; BUT I ASSURE YOU, MY DEAR JANE, THE CAMPBELLS CAN
HARDLY BE MORE INTERESTED ABOUT YOU THAN I AM.  I SHALL WRITE
TO MRS. PARTRIDGE IN A DAY OR TWO, AND SHALL GIVE HER A STRICT
CHARGE TO BE ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR ANY THING ELIGIBLE."

"THANK YOU, BUT I WOULD RATHER YOU DID NOT MENTION THE SUBJECT
TO HER; TILL THE TIME DRAWS NEARER, I DO NOT WISH TO BE GIVING
ANY BODY TROUBLE."

"BUT, MY DEAR CHILD, THE TIME IS DRAWING NEAR; HERE IS APRIL,
AND JUNE, OR SAY EVEN JULY, IS VERY NEAR, WITH SUCH BUSINESS
TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE US.  YOUR INEXPERIENCE REALLY AMUSES ME!
A SITUATION SUCH AS YOU DESERVE, AND YOUR FRIENDS WOULD REQUIRE FOR YOU,
IS NO EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE, IS NOT OBTAINED AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE;
INDEED, INDEED, WE MUST BEGIN INQUIRING DIRECTLY."

"EXCUSE ME, MA'AM, BUT THIS IS BY NO MEANS MY INTENTION; I MAKE NO
INQUIRY MYSELF, AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE ANY MADE BY MY FRIENDS.
WHEN I AM QUITE DETERMINED AS TO THE TIME, I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID
OF BEING LONG UNEMPLOYED.  THERE ARE PLACES IN TOWN, OFFICES,
WHERE INQUIRY WOULD SOON PRODUCE SOMETHING--OFFICES FOR THE SALE--
NOT QUITE OF HUMAN FLESH--BUT OF HUMAN INTELLECT."

"OH! MY DEAR, HUMAN FLESH!  YOU QUITE SHOCK ME; IF YOU MEAN A FLING
AT THE SLAVE-TRADE, I ASSURE YOU MR. SUCKLING WAS ALWAYS RATHER
A FRIEND TO THE ABOLITION."

"I DID NOT MEAN, I WAS NOT THINKING OF THE SLAVE-TRADE," REPLIED JANE;
"GOVERNESS-TRADE, I ASSURE YOU, WAS ALL THAT I HAD IN VIEW;
WIDELY DIFFERENT CERTAINLY AS TO THE GUILT OF THOSE WHO CARRY IT ON;
BUT AS TO THE GREATER MISERY OF THE VICTIMS, I DO NOT KNOW WHERE
IT LIES.  BUT I ONLY MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ADVERTISING OFFICES,
AND THAT BY APPLYING TO THEM I SHOULD HAVE NO DOUBT OF VERY SOON
MEETING WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO."

"SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO!" REPEATED MRS. ELTON.  "AYE, _THAT_ MAY
SUIT YOUR HUMBLE IDEAS OF YOURSELF;--I KNOW WHAT A MODEST CREATURE
YOU ARE; BUT IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOUR FRIENDS TO HAVE YOU TAKING UP
WITH ANY THING THAT MAY OFFER, ANY INFERIOR, COMMONPLACE SITUATION,
IN A FAMILY NOT MOVING IN A CERTAIN CIRCLE, OR ABLE TO COMMAND
THE ELEGANCIES OF LIFE."

"YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING; BUT AS TO ALL THAT, I AM VERY INDIFFERENT;
IT WOULD BE NO OBJECT TO ME TO BE WITH THE RICH; MY MORTIFICATIONS,
I THINK, WOULD ONLY BE THE GREATER; I SHOULD SUFFER MORE FROM COMPARISON.
A GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY IS ALL THAT I SHOULD CONDITION FOR."

"I KNOW YOU, I KNOW YOU; YOU WOULD TAKE UP WITH ANY THING; BUT I
SHALL BE A LITTLE MORE NICE, AND I AM SURE THE GOOD CAMPBELLS WILL
BE QUITE ON MY SIDE; WITH YOUR SUPERIOR TALENTS, YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO MOVE IN THE FIRST CIRCLE.  YOUR MUSICAL KNOWLEDGE ALONE WOULD
ENTITLE YOU TO NAME YOUR OWN TERMS, HAVE AS MANY ROOMS AS YOU LIKE,
AND MIX IN THE FAMILY AS MUCH AS YOU CHOSE;--THAT IS--I DO NOT KNOW--
IF YOU KNEW THE HARP, YOU MIGHT DO ALL THAT, I AM VERY SURE;
BUT YOU SING AS WELL AS PLAY;--YES, I REALLY BELIEVE YOU MIGHT,
EVEN WITHOUT THE HARP, STIPULATE FOR WHAT YOU CHOSE;--AND YOU MUST
AND SHALL BE DELIGHTFULLY, HONOURABLY AND COMFORTABLY SETTLED BEFORE
THE CAMPBELLS OR I HAVE ANY REST."

"YOU MAY WELL CLASS THE DELIGHT, THE HONOUR, AND THE COMFORT
OF SUCH A SITUATION TOGETHER," SAID JANE, "THEY ARE PRETTY SURE
TO BE EQUAL; HOWEVER, I AM VERY SERIOUS IN NOT WISHING ANY THING
TO BE ATTEMPTED AT PRESENT FOR ME.  I AM EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU,
MRS. ELTON, I AM OBLIGED TO ANY BODY WHO FEELS FOR ME, BUT I AM
QUITE SERIOUS IN WISHING NOTHING TO BE DONE TILL THE SUMMER.
FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS LONGER I SHALL REMAIN WHERE I AM, AND AS
I AM."

"AND I AM QUITE SERIOUS TOO, I ASSURE YOU," REPLIED MRS. ELTON GAILY,
"IN RESOLVING TO BE ALWAYS ON THE WATCH, AND EMPLOYING MY FRIENDS
TO WATCH ALSO, THAT NOTHING REALLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE MAY PASS US."

IN THIS STYLE SHE RAN ON; NEVER THOROUGHLY STOPPED BY ANY THING
TILL MR. WOODHOUSE CAME INTO THE ROOM; HER VANITY HAD THEN A CHANGE
OF OBJECT, AND EMMA HEARD HER SAYING IN THE SAME HALF-WHISPER TO JANE,

"HERE COMES THIS DEAR OLD BEAU OF MINE, I PROTEST!--ONLY THINK OF HIS
GALLANTRY IN COMING AWAY BEFORE THE OTHER MEN!--WHAT A DEAR CREATURE
HE IS;--I ASSURE YOU I LIKE HIM EXCESSIVELY.  I ADMIRE ALL THAT QUAINT,
OLD-FASHIONED POLITENESS; IT IS MUCH MORE TO MY TASTE THAN MODERN EASE;
MODERN EASE OFTEN DISGUSTS ME.  BUT THIS GOOD OLD MR. WOODHOUSE,
I WISH YOU HAD HEARD HIS GALLANT SPEECHES TO ME AT DINNER.  OH!  I ASSURE
YOU I BEGAN TO THINK MY CARO SPOSO WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY JEALOUS.
I FANCY I AM RATHER A FAVOURITE; HE TOOK NOTICE OF MY GOWN.
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?--SELINA'S CHOICE--HANDSOME, I THINK, BUT I
DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT IS NOT OVER-TRIMMED; I HAVE THE GREATEST
DISLIKE TO THE IDEA OF BEING OVER-TRIMMED--QUITE A HORROR OF FINERY.
I MUST PUT ON A FEW ORNAMENTS NOW, BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED OF ME.
A BRIDE, YOU KNOW, MUST APPEAR LIKE A BRIDE, BUT MY NATURAL TASTE
IS ALL FOR SIMPLICITY; A SIMPLE STYLE OF DRESS IS SO INFINITELY
PREFERABLE TO FINERY.  BUT I AM QUITE IN THE MINORITY, I BELIEVE;
FEW PEOPLE SEEM TO VALUE SIMPLICITY OF DRESS,--SHOW AND FINERY
ARE EVERY THING.  I HAVE SOME NOTION OF PUTTING SUCH A TRIMMING
AS THIS TO MY WHITE AND SILVER POPLIN.  DO YOU THINK IT WILL
LOOK WELL?"

THE WHOLE PARTY WERE BUT JUST REASSEMBLED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
WHEN MR. WESTON MADE HIS APPEARANCE AMONG THEM.  HE HAD RETURNED
TO A LATE DINNER, AND WALKED TO HARTFIELD AS SOON AS IT WAS OVER.
HE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH EXPECTED BY THE BEST JUDGES, FOR SURPRIZE--
BUT THERE WAS GREAT JOY.  MR. WOODHOUSE WAS ALMOST AS GLAD TO SEE
HIM NOW, AS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY TO SEE HIM BEFORE.  JOHN KNIGHTLEY
ONLY WAS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT.--THAT A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE SPENT
HIS EVENING QUIETLY AT HOME AFTER A DAY OF BUSINESS IN LONDON,
SHOULD SET OFF AGAIN, AND WALK HALF A MILE TO ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE,
FOR THE SAKE OF BEING IN MIXED COMPANY TILL BED-TIME, OF FINISHING
HIS DAY IN THE EFFORTS OF CIVILITY AND THE NOISE OF NUMBERS,
WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO STRIKE HIM DEEPLY.  A MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN MOTION
SINCE EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, AND MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN STILL,
WHO HAD BEEN LONG TALKING, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN SILENT, WHO HAD BEEN
IN MORE THAN ONE CROWD, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALONE!--SUCH A MAN,
TO QUIT THE TRANQUILLITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS OWN FIRESIDE,
AND ON THE EVENING OF A COLD SLEETY APRIL DAY RUSH OUT AGAIN INTO
THE WORLD!--COULD HE BY A TOUCH OF HIS FINGER HAVE INSTANTLY TAKEN
BACK HIS WIFE, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOTIVE; BUT HIS COMING WOULD
PROBABLY PROLONG RATHER THAN BREAK UP THE PARTY.  JOHN KNIGHTLEY
LOOKED AT HIM WITH AMAZEMENT, THEN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS, AND SAID,
"I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT EVEN OF _HIM_."

MR. WESTON MEANWHILE, PERFECTLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF THE INDIGNATION
HE WAS EXCITING, HAPPY AND CHEERFUL AS USUAL, AND WITH ALL
THE RIGHT OF BEING PRINCIPAL TALKER, WHICH A DAY SPENT ANYWHERE
FROM HOME CONFERS, WAS MAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE AMONG THE REST;
AND HAVING SATISFIED THE INQUIRIES OF HIS WIFE AS TO HIS DINNER,
CONVINCING HER THAT NONE OF ALL HER CAREFUL DIRECTIONS TO THE SERVANTS
HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN, AND SPREAD ABROAD WHAT PUBLIC NEWS HE HAD HEARD,
WAS PROCEEDING TO A FAMILY COMMUNICATION, WHICH, THOUGH PRINCIPALLY
ADDRESSED TO MRS. WESTON, HE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT OF BEING
HIGHLY INTERESTING TO EVERY BODY IN THE ROOM.  HE GAVE HER A LETTER,
IT WAS FROM FRANK, AND TO HERSELF; HE HAD MET WITH IT IN HIS WAY,
AND HAD TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF OPENING IT.

"READ IT, READ IT," SAID HE, "IT WILL GIVE YOU PLEASURE;
ONLY A FEW LINES--WILL NOT TAKE YOU LONG; READ IT TO EMMA."

THE TWO LADIES LOOKED OVER IT TOGETHER; AND HE SAT SMILING
AND TALKING TO THEM THE WHOLE TIME, IN A VOICE A LITTLE SUBDUED,
BUT VERY AUDIBLE TO EVERY BODY.

"WELL, HE IS COMING, YOU SEE; GOOD NEWS, I THINK.  WELL, WHAT DO
YOU SAY TO IT?--I ALWAYS TOLD YOU HE WOULD BE HERE AGAIN SOON,
DID NOT I?--ANNE, MY DEAR, DID NOT I ALWAYS TELL YOU SO, AND YOU WOULD
NOT BELIEVE ME?--IN TOWN NEXT WEEK, YOU SEE--AT THE LATEST, I DARE SAY;
FOR _SHE_ IS AS IMPATIENT AS THE BLACK GENTLEMAN WHEN ANY THING IS
TO BE DONE; MOST LIKELY THEY WILL BE THERE TO-MORROW OR SATURDAY.
AS TO HER ILLNESS, ALL NOTHING OF COURSE.  BUT IT IS AN EXCELLENT
THING TO HAVE FRANK AMONG US AGAIN, SO NEAR AS TOWN.  THEY WILL STAY
A GOOD WHILE WHEN THEY DO COME, AND HE WILL BE HALF HIS TIME WITH US.
THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANTED.  WELL, PRETTY GOOD NEWS, IS NOT IT?
HAVE YOU FINISHED IT?  HAS EMMA READ IT ALL?  PUT IT UP, PUT IT UP;
WE WILL HAVE A GOOD TALK ABOUT IT SOME OTHER TIME, BUT IT WILL NOT
DO NOW.  I SHALL ONLY JUST MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE OTHERS IN A
COMMON WAY."

MRS. WESTON WAS MOST COMFORTABLY PLEASED ON THE OCCASION.
HER LOOKS AND WORDS HAD NOTHING TO RESTRAIN THEM.  SHE WAS HAPPY,
SHE KNEW SHE WAS HAPPY, AND KNEW SHE OUGHT TO BE HAPPY.
HER CONGRATULATIONS WERE WARM AND OPEN; BUT EMMA COULD NOT SPEAK
SO FLUENTLY.  _SHE_ WAS A LITTLE OCCUPIED IN WEIGHING HER OWN FEELINGS,
AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE OF HER AGITATION, WHICH SHE
RATHER THOUGHT WAS CONSIDERABLE.

MR. WESTON, HOWEVER, TOO EAGER TO BE VERY OBSERVANT, TOO COMMUNICATIVE
TO WANT OTHERS TO TALK, WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH WHAT SHE DID SAY,
AND SOON MOVED AWAY TO MAKE THE REST OF HIS FRIENDS HAPPY BY A PARTIAL
COMMUNICATION OF WHAT THE WHOLE ROOM MUST HAVE OVERHEARD ALREADY.

IT WAS WELL THAT HE TOOK EVERY BODY'S JOY FOR GRANTED, OR HE
MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT EITHER MR. WOODHOUSE OR MR. KNIGHTLEY
PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED.  THEY WERE THE FIRST ENTITLED,
AFTER MRS. WESTON AND EMMA, TO BE MADE HAPPY;--FROM THEM HE WOULD
HAVE PROCEEDED TO MISS FAIRFAX, BUT SHE WAS SO DEEP IN CONVERSATION
WITH JOHN KNIGHTLEY, THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO POSITIVE
AN INTERRUPTION; AND FINDING HIMSELF CLOSE TO MRS. ELTON, AND
HER ATTENTION DISENGAGED, HE NECESSARILY BEGAN ON THE SUBJECT WITH HER.



CHAPTER XVIII


"I HOPE I SHALL SOON HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING MY SON TO YOU,"
SAID MR. WESTON.

MRS. ELTON, VERY WILLING TO SUPPOSE A PARTICULAR COMPLIMENT INTENDED
HER BY SUCH A HOPE, SMILED MOST GRACIOUSLY.

"YOU HAVE HEARD OF A CERTAIN FRANK CHURCHILL, I PRESUME," HE CONTINUED--
"AND KNOW HIM TO BE MY SON, THOUGH HE DOES NOT BEAR MY NAME."

"OH! YES, AND I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY IN HIS ACQUAINTANCE.
I AM SURE MR. ELTON WILL LOSE NO TIME IN CALLING ON HIM; AND WE
SHALL BOTH HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN SEEING HIM AT THE VICARAGE."

"YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING.--FRANK WILL BE EXTREMELY HAPPY, I AM SURE.--
HE IS TO BE IN TOWN NEXT WEEK, IF NOT SOONER.  WE HAVE NOTICE OF IT
IN A LETTER TO-DAY. I MET THE LETTERS IN MY WAY THIS MORNING,
AND SEEING MY SON'S HAND, PRESUMED TO OPEN IT--THOUGH IT WAS NOT DIRECTED
TO ME--IT WAS TO MRS. WESTON.  SHE IS HIS PRINCIPAL CORRESPONDENT,
I ASSURE YOU.  I HARDLY EVER GET A LETTER."

"AND SO YOU ABSOLUTELY OPENED WHAT WAS DIRECTED TO HER!  OH!  MR. WESTON--
(LAUGHING AFFECTEDLY) I MUST PROTEST AGAINST THAT.--A MOST DANGEROUS
PRECEDENT INDEED!--I BEG YOU WILL NOT LET YOUR NEIGHBOURS FOLLOW
YOUR EXAMPLE.--UPON MY WORD, IF THIS IS WHAT I AM TO EXPECT,
WE MARRIED WOMEN MUST BEGIN TO EXERT OURSELVES!--OH!  MR. WESTON,
I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT OF YOU!"

"AYE, WE MEN ARE SAD FELLOWS.  YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
MRS. ELTON.--THIS LETTER TELLS US--IT IS A SHORT LETTER--WRITTEN IN
A HURRY, MERELY TO GIVE US NOTICE--IT TELLS US THAT THEY ARE ALL
COMING UP TO TOWN DIRECTLY, ON MRS. CHURCHILL'S ACCOUNT--SHE HAS
NOT BEEN WELL THE WHOLE WINTER, AND THINKS ENSCOMBE TOO COLD FOR HER--
SO THEY ARE ALL TO MOVE SOUTHWARD WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME."

"INDEED!--FROM YORKSHIRE, I THINK.  ENSCOMBE IS IN YORKSHIRE?"

"YES, THEY ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILES FROM LONDON.
A CONSIDERABLE JOURNEY."

"YES, UPON MY WORD, VERY CONSIDERABLE.  SIXTY-FIVE MILES FARTHER
THAN FROM MAPLE GROVE TO LONDON.  BUT WHAT IS DISTANCE, MR. WESTON,
TO PEOPLE OF LARGE FORTUNE?--YOU WOULD BE AMAZED TO HEAR HOW MY BROTHER,
MR. SUCKLING, SOMETIMES FLIES ABOUT.  YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE ME--
BUT TWICE IN ONE WEEK HE AND MR. BRAGGE WENT TO LONDON AND BACK AGAIN
WITH FOUR HORSES."

"THE EVIL OF THE DISTANCE FROM ENSCOMBE," SAID MR. WESTON, "IS, THAT
MRS. CHURCHILL, _AS_ _WE_ _UNDERSTAND_, HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE THE
SOFA FOR A WEEK TOGETHER.  IN FRANK'S LAST LETTER SHE COMPLAINED,
HE SAID, OF BEING TOO WEAK TO GET INTO HER CONSERVATORY WITHOUT HAVING
BOTH HIS ARM AND HIS UNCLE'S! THIS, YOU KNOW, SPEAKS A GREAT DEGREE
OF WEAKNESS--BUT NOW SHE IS SO IMPATIENT TO BE IN TOWN, THAT SHE
MEANS TO SLEEP ONLY TWO NIGHTS ON THE ROAD.--SO FRANK WRITES WORD.
CERTAINLY, DELICATE LADIES HAVE VERY EXTRAORDINARY CONSTITUTIONS,
MRS. ELTON.  YOU MUST GRANT ME THAT."

"NO, INDEED, I SHALL GRANT YOU NOTHING.  I ALWAYS TAKE THE PART
OF MY OWN SEX.  I DO INDEED.  I GIVE YOU NOTICE--YOU WILL FIND ME
A FORMIDABLE ANTAGONIST ON THAT POINT.  I ALWAYS STAND UP FOR WOMEN--
AND I ASSURE YOU, IF YOU KNEW HOW SELINA FEELS WITH RESPECT
TO SLEEPING AT AN INN, YOU WOULD NOT WONDER AT MRS. CHURCHILL'S
MAKING INCREDIBLE EXERTIONS TO AVOID IT.  SELINA SAYS IT IS QUITE
HORROR TO HER--AND I BELIEVE I HAVE CAUGHT A LITTLE OF HER NICETY.
SHE ALWAYS TRAVELS WITH HER OWN SHEETS; AN EXCELLENT PRECAUTION.
DOES MRS. CHURCHILL DO THE SAME?"

"DEPEND UPON IT, MRS. CHURCHILL DOES EVERY THING THAT ANY OTHER
FINE LADY EVER DID.  MRS. CHURCHILL WILL NOT BE SECOND TO ANY LADY
IN THE LAND FOR"--

MRS. ELTON EAGERLY INTERPOSED WITH,

"OH!  MR. WESTON, DO NOT MISTAKE ME.  SELINA IS NO FINE LADY,
I ASSURE YOU.  DO NOT RUN AWAY WITH SUCH AN IDEA."

"IS NOT SHE?  THEN SHE IS NO RULE FOR MRS. CHURCHILL, WHO IS
AS THOROUGH A FINE LADY AS ANY BODY EVER BEHELD."

MRS. ELTON BEGAN TO THINK SHE HAD BEEN WRONG IN DISCLAIMING SO WARMLY.
IT WAS BY NO MEANS HER OBJECT TO HAVE IT BELIEVED THAT HER SISTER
WAS _NOT_ A FINE LADY; PERHAPS THERE WAS WANT OF SPIRIT IN THE PRETENCE
OF IT;--AND SHE WAS CONSIDERING IN WHAT WAY SHE HAD BEST RETRACT,
WHEN MR. WESTON WENT ON.

"MRS. CHURCHILL IS NOT MUCH IN MY GOOD GRACES, AS YOU MAY SUSPECT--
BUT THIS IS QUITE BETWEEN OURSELVES.  SHE IS VERY FOND OF FRANK,
AND THEREFORE I WOULD NOT SPEAK ILL OF HER.  BESIDES, SHE IS OUT OF
HEALTH NOW; BUT _THAT_ INDEED, BY HER OWN ACCOUNT, SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN.
I WOULD NOT SAY SO TO EVERY BODY, MRS. ELTON, BUT I HAVE NOT MUCH
FAITH IN MRS. CHURCHILL'S ILLNESS."

"IF SHE IS REALLY ILL, WHY NOT GO TO BATH, MR. WESTON?--TO BATH,
OR TO CLIFTON?"  "SHE HAS TAKEN IT INTO HER HEAD THAT ENSCOMBE IS TOO
COLD FOR HER.  THE FACT IS, I SUPPOSE, THAT SHE IS TIRED OF ENSCOMBE.
SHE HAS NOW BEEN A LONGER TIME STATIONARY THERE, THAN SHE EVER
WAS BEFORE, AND SHE BEGINS TO WANT CHANGE.  IT IS A RETIRED PLACE.
A FINE PLACE, BUT VERY RETIRED."

"AYE--LIKE MAPLE GROVE, I DARE SAY.  NOTHING CAN STAND MORE RETIRED FROM
THE ROAD THAN MAPLE GROVE.  SUCH AN IMMENSE PLANTATION ALL ROUND IT!
YOU SEEM SHUT OUT FROM EVERY THING--IN THE MOST COMPLETE RETIREMENT.--
AND MRS. CHURCHILL PROBABLY HAS NOT HEALTH OR SPIRITS LIKE SELINA
TO ENJOY THAT SORT OF SECLUSION.  OR, PERHAPS SHE MAY NOT HAVE
RESOURCES ENOUGH IN HERSELF TO BE QUALIFIED FOR A COUNTRY LIFE.
I ALWAYS SAY A WOMAN CANNOT HAVE TOO MANY RESOURCES--AND I FEEL
VERY THANKFUL THAT I HAVE SO MANY MYSELF AS TO BE QUITE INDEPENDENT
OF SOCIETY."

"FRANK WAS HERE IN FEBRUARY FOR A FORTNIGHT."

"SO I REMEMBER TO HAVE HEARD.  HE WILL FIND AN _ADDITION_ TO THE
SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY WHEN HE COMES AGAIN; THAT IS, IF I MAY PRESUME
TO CALL MYSELF AN ADDITION.  BUT PERHAPS HE MAY NEVER HAVE HEARD
OF THERE BEING SUCH A CREATURE IN THE WORLD."

THIS WAS TOO LOUD A CALL FOR A COMPLIMENT TO BE PASSED BY,
AND MR. WESTON, WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE, IMMEDIATELY EXCLAIMED,

"MY DEAR MADAM!  NOBODY BUT YOURSELF COULD IMAGINE SUCH A
THING POSSIBLE.  NOT HEARD OF YOU!--I BELIEVE MRS. WESTON'S
LETTERS LATELY HAVE BEEN FULL OF VERY LITTLE ELSE THAN MRS. ELTON."

HE HAD DONE HIS DUTY AND COULD RETURN TO HIS SON.

"WHEN FRANK LEFT US," CONTINUED HE, "IT WAS QUITE UNCERTAIN WHEN WE
MIGHT SEE HIM AGAIN, WHICH MAKES THIS DAY'S NEWS DOUBLY WELCOME.
IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED.  THAT IS, _I_ ALWAYS HAD A STRONG
PERSUASION HE WOULD BE HERE AGAIN SOON, I WAS SURE SOMETHING
FAVOURABLE WOULD TURN UP--BUT NOBODY BELIEVED ME.  HE AND MRS. WESTON
WERE BOTH DREADFULLY DESPONDING.  `HOW COULD HE CONTRIVE TO COME?
AND HOW COULD IT BE SUPPOSED THAT HIS UNCLE AND AUNT WOULD SPARE
HIM AGAIN?' AND SO FORTH--I ALWAYS FELT THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN
IN OUR FAVOUR; AND SO IT HAS, YOU SEE.  I HAVE OBSERVED, MRS. ELTON,
IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE, THAT IF THINGS ARE GOING UNTOWARDLY ONE MONTH,
THEY ARE SURE TO MEND THE NEXT."

"VERY TRUE, MR. WESTON, PERFECTLY TRUE.  IT IS JUST WHAT I USED
TO SAY TO A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN IN COMPANY IN THE DAYS OF COURTSHIP,
WHEN, BECAUSE THINGS DID NOT GO QUITE RIGHT, DID NOT PROCEED WITH ALL
THE RAPIDITY WHICH SUITED HIS FEELINGS, HE WAS APT TO BE IN DESPAIR,
AND EXCLAIM THAT HE WAS SURE AT THIS RATE IT WOULD BE _MAY_ BEFORE
HYMEN'S SAFFRON ROBE WOULD BE PUT ON FOR US.  OH! THE PAINS I HAVE
BEEN AT TO DISPEL THOSE GLOOMY IDEAS AND GIVE HIM CHEERFULLER VIEWS!
THE CARRIAGE--WE HAD DISAPPOINTMENTS ABOUT THE CARRIAGE;--ONE MORNING,
I REMEMBER, HE CAME TO ME QUITE IN DESPAIR."

SHE WAS STOPPED BY A SLIGHT FIT OF COUGHING, AND MR. WESTON INSTANTLY
SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF GOING ON.

"YOU WERE MENTIONING MAY.  MAY IS THE VERY MONTH WHICH MRS. CHURCHILL
IS ORDERED, OR HAS ORDERED HERSELF, TO SPEND IN SOME WARMER PLACE
THAN ENSCOMBE--IN SHORT, TO SPEND IN LONDON; SO THAT WE HAVE THE
AGREEABLE PROSPECT OF FREQUENT VISITS FROM FRANK THE WHOLE SPRING--
PRECISELY THE SEASON OF THE YEAR WHICH ONE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN
FOR IT:  DAYS ALMOST AT THE LONGEST; WEATHER GENIAL AND PLEASANT,
ALWAYS INVITING ONE OUT, AND NEVER TOO HOT FOR EXERCISE.  WHEN HE
WAS HERE BEFORE, WE MADE THE BEST OF IT; BUT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL
OF WET, DAMP, CHEERLESS WEATHER; THERE ALWAYS IS IN FEBRUARY, YOU KNOW,
AND WE COULD NOT DO HALF THAT WE INTENDED.  NOW WILL BE THE TIME.
THIS WILL BE COMPLETE ENJOYMENT; AND I DO NOT KNOW, MRS. ELTON,
WHETHER THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR MEETINGS, THE SORT OF CONSTANT
EXPECTATION THERE WILL BE OF HIS COMING IN TO-DAY OR TO-MORROW,
AND AT ANY HOUR, MAY NOT BE MORE FRIENDLY TO HAPPINESS THAN HAVING
HIM ACTUALLY IN THE HOUSE.  I THINK IT IS SO.  I THINK IT IS THE
STATE OF MIND WHICH GIVES MOST SPIRIT AND DELIGHT.  I HOPE YOU
WILL BE PLEASED WITH MY SON; BUT YOU MUST NOT EXPECT A PRODIGY.
HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT A FINE YOUNG MAN, BUT DO NOT EXPECT A PRODIGY.
MRS. WESTON'S PARTIALITY FOR HIM IS VERY GREAT, AND, AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE,
MOST GRATIFYING TO ME.  SHE THINKS NOBODY EQUAL TO HIM."

"AND I ASSURE YOU, MR. WESTON, I HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT MY
OPINION WILL BE DECIDEDLY IN HIS FAVOUR.  I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH
IN PRAISE OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL.--AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FAIR
TO OBSERVE, THAT I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO ALWAYS JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES,
AND ARE BY NO MEANS IMPLICITLY GUIDED BY OTHERS.  I GIVE YOU NOTICE
THAT AS I FIND YOUR SON, SO I SHALL JUDGE OF HIM.--I AM NO FLATTERER."

MR. WESTON WAS MUSING.

"I HOPE," SAID HE PRESENTLY, "I HAVE NOT BEEN SEVERE UPON POOR
MRS. CHURCHILL.  IF SHE IS ILL I SHOULD BE SORRY TO DO HER INJUSTICE;
BUT THERE ARE SOME TRAITS IN HER CHARACTER WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT
FOR ME TO SPEAK OF HER WITH THE FORBEARANCE I COULD WISH.
YOU CANNOT BE IGNORANT, MRS. ELTON, OF MY CONNEXION WITH THE FAMILY,
NOR OF THE TREATMENT I HAVE MET WITH; AND, BETWEEN OURSELVES,
THE WHOLE BLAME OF IT IS TO BE LAID TO HER.  SHE WAS THE INSTIGATOR.
FRANK'S MOTHER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SLIGHTED AS SHE WAS BUT FOR HER.
MR. CHURCHILL HAS PRIDE; BUT HIS PRIDE IS NOTHING TO HIS WIFE'S:
HIS IS A QUIET, INDOLENT, GENTLEMANLIKE SORT OF PRIDE THAT WOULD
HARM NOBODY, AND ONLY MAKE HIMSELF A LITTLE HELPLESS AND TIRESOME;
BUT HER PRIDE IS ARROGANCE AND INSOLENCE!  AND WHAT INCLINES ONE LESS
TO BEAR, SHE HAS NO FAIR PRETENCE OF FAMILY OR BLOOD.  SHE WAS NOBODY
WHEN HE MARRIED HER, BARELY THE DAUGHTER OF A GENTLEMAN; BUT EVER
SINCE HER BEING TURNED INTO A CHURCHILL SHE HAS OUT-CHURCHILL'D THEM
ALL IN HIGH AND MIGHTY CLAIMS:  BUT IN HERSELF, I ASSURE YOU, SHE IS
AN UPSTART."

"ONLY THINK! WELL, THAT MUST BE INFINITELY PROVOKING!  I HAVE QUITE
A HORROR OF UPSTARTS.  MAPLE GROVE HAS GIVEN ME A THOROUGH DISGUST
TO PEOPLE OF THAT SORT; FOR THERE IS A FAMILY IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
WHO ARE SUCH AN ANNOYANCE TO MY BROTHER AND SISTER FROM THE AIRS
THEY GIVE THEMSELVES!  YOUR DESCRIPTION OF MRS. CHURCHILL MADE ME
THINK OF THEM DIRECTLY.  PEOPLE OF THE NAME OF TUPMAN, VERY LATELY
SETTLED THERE, AND ENCUMBERED WITH MANY LOW CONNEXIONS, BUT GIVING
THEMSELVES IMMENSE AIRS, AND EXPECTING TO BE ON A FOOTING WITH THE OLD
ESTABLISHED FAMILIES.  A YEAR AND A HALF IS THE VERY UTMOST THAT THEY CAN
HAVE LIVED AT WEST HALL; AND HOW THEY GOT THEIR FORTUNE NOBODY KNOWS.
THEY CAME FROM BIRMINGHAM, WHICH IS NOT A PLACE TO PROMISE MUCH,
YOU KNOW, MR. WESTON.  ONE HAS NOT GREAT HOPES FROM BIRMINGHAM.
I ALWAYS SAY THERE IS SOMETHING DIREFUL IN THE SOUND:  BUT NOTHING
MORE IS POSITIVELY KNOWN OF THE TUPMANS, THOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS
I ASSURE YOU ARE SUSPECTED; AND YET BY THEIR MANNERS THEY EVIDENTLY
THINK THEMSELVES EQUAL EVEN TO MY BROTHER, MR. SUCKLING, WHO HAPPENS
TO BE ONE OF THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS.  IT IS INFINITELY TOO BAD.
MR. SUCKLING, WHO HAS BEEN ELEVEN YEARS A RESIDENT AT MAPLE GROVE,
AND WHOSE FATHER HAD IT BEFORE HIM--I BELIEVE, AT LEAST--I AM
ALMOST SURE THAT OLD MR. SUCKLING HAD COMPLETED THE PURCHASE BEFORE
HIS DEATH."

THEY WERE INTERRUPTED.  TEA WAS CARRYING ROUND, AND MR. WESTON,
HAVING SAID ALL THAT HE WANTED, SOON TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF
WALKING AWAY.

AFTER TEA, MR. AND MRS. WESTON, AND MR. ELTON SAT DOWN WITH MR. WOODHOUSE
TO CARDS.  THE REMAINING FIVE WERE LEFT TO THEIR OWN POWERS,
AND EMMA DOUBTED THEIR GETTING ON VERY WELL; FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY SEEMED
LITTLE DISPOSED FOR CONVERSATION; MRS. ELTON WAS WANTING NOTICE,
WHICH NOBODY HAD INCLINATION TO PAY, AND SHE WAS HERSELF
IN A WORRY OF SPIRITS WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE HER PREFER BEING SILENT.

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY PROVED MORE TALKATIVE THAN HIS BROTHER.
HE WAS TO LEAVE THEM EARLY THE NEXT DAY; AND HE SOON BEGAN WITH--

"WELL, EMMA, I DO NOT BELIEVE I HAVE ANY THING MORE TO SAY ABOUT
THE BOYS; BUT YOU HAVE YOUR SISTER'S LETTER, AND EVERY THING IS
DOWN AT FULL LENGTH THERE WE MAY BE SURE.  MY CHARGE WOULD BE MUCH
MORE CONCISE THAN HER'S, AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH IN THE SAME SPIRIT;
ALL THAT I HAVE TO RECOMMEND BEING COMPRISED IN, DO NOT SPOIL THEM,
AND DO NOT PHYSIC THEM."

"I RATHER HOPE TO SATISFY YOU BOTH," SAID EMMA, "FOR I SHALL DO ALL
IN MY POWER TO MAKE THEM HAPPY, WHICH WILL BE ENOUGH FOR ISABELLA;
AND HAPPINESS MUST PRECLUDE FALSE INDULGENCE AND PHYSIC."

"AND IF YOU FIND THEM TROUBLESOME, YOU MUST SEND THEM HOME AGAIN."

"THAT IS VERY LIKELY.  YOU THINK SO, DO NOT YOU?"

"I HOPE I AM AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE TOO NOISY FOR YOUR FATHER--
OR EVEN MAY BE SOME ENCUMBRANCE TO YOU, IF YOUR VISITING ENGAGEMENTS
CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE DONE LATELY."

"INCREASE!"

"CERTAINLY; YOU MUST BE SENSIBLE THAT THE LAST HALF-YEAR HAS MADE
A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN YOUR WAY OF LIFE."

"DIFFERENCE!  NO INDEED I AM NOT."

"THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF YOUR BEING MUCH MORE ENGAGED WITH COMPANY
THAN YOU USED TO BE.  WITNESS THIS VERY TIME.  HERE AM I COME
DOWN FOR ONLY ONE DAY, AND YOU ARE ENGAGED WITH A DINNER-PARTY!--
WHEN DID IT HAPPEN BEFORE, OR ANY THING LIKE IT?  YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD
IS INCREASING, AND YOU MIX MORE WITH IT.  A LITTLE WHILE AGO,
EVERY LETTER TO ISABELLA BROUGHT AN ACCOUNT OF FRESH GAIETIES;
DINNERS AT MR. COLE'S, OR BALLS AT THE CROWN.  THE DIFFERENCE
WHICH RANDALLS, RANDALLS ALONE MAKES IN YOUR GOINGS-ON, IS VERY GREAT."

"YES," SAID HIS BROTHER QUICKLY, "IT IS RANDALLS THAT DOES IT ALL."

"VERY WELL--AND AS RANDALLS, I SUPPOSE, IS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE LESS
INFLUENCE THAN HERETOFORE, IT STRIKES ME AS A POSSIBLE THING, EMMA,
THAT HENRY AND JOHN MAY BE SOMETIMES IN THE WAY.  AND IF THEY ARE,
I ONLY BEG YOU TO SEND THEM HOME."

"NO," CRIED MR. KNIGHTLEY, "THAT NEED NOT BE THE CONSEQUENCE.
LET THEM BE SENT TO DONWELL.  I SHALL CERTAINLY BE AT LEISURE."

"UPON MY WORD," EXCLAIMED EMMA, "YOU AMUSE ME!  I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
HOW MANY OF ALL MY NUMEROUS ENGAGEMENTS TAKE PLACE WITHOUT YOUR BEING
OF THE PARTY; AND WHY I AM TO BE SUPPOSED IN DANGER OF WANTING LEISURE
TO ATTEND TO THE LITTLE BOYS.  THESE AMAZING ENGAGEMENTS OF MINE--
WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN?  DINING ONCE WITH THE COLES--AND HAVING A BALL
TALKED OF, WHICH NEVER TOOK PLACE.  I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU--(NODDING AT
MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY)--YOUR GOOD FORTUNE IN MEETING WITH SO MANY OF
YOUR FRIENDS AT ONCE HERE, DELIGHTS YOU TOO MUCH TO PASS UNNOTICED.
BUT YOU, (TURNING TO MR. KNIGHTLEY,) WHO KNOW HOW VERY, VERY SELDOM
I AM EVER TWO HOURS FROM HARTFIELD, WHY YOU SHOULD FORESEE SUCH A
SERIES OF DISSIPATION FOR ME, I CANNOT IMAGINE.  AND AS TO MY DEAR
LITTLE BOYS, I MUST SAY, THAT IF AUNT EMMA HAS NOT TIME FOR THEM,
I DO NOT THINK THEY WOULD FARE MUCH BETTER WITH UNCLE KNIGHTLEY,
WHO IS ABSENT FROM HOME ABOUT FIVE HOURS WHERE SHE IS ABSENT ONE--
AND WHO, WHEN HE IS AT HOME, IS EITHER READING TO HIMSELF OR SETTLING
HIS ACCOUNTS."

MR. KNIGHTLEY SEEMED TO BE TRYING NOT TO SMILE; AND SUCCEEDED
WITHOUT DIFFICULTY, UPON MRS. ELTON'S BEGINNING TO TALK TO HIM.




VOLUME III



CHAPTER I


A VERY LITTLE QUIET REFLECTION WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY EMMA AS TO THE
NATURE OF HER AGITATION ON HEARING THIS NEWS OF FRANK CHURCHILL.
SHE WAS SOON CONVINCED THAT IT WAS NOT FOR HERSELF SHE WAS FEELING AT
ALL APPREHENSIVE OR EMBARRASSED; IT WAS FOR HIM.  HER OWN ATTACHMENT
HAD REALLY SUBSIDED INTO A MERE NOTHING; IT WAS NOT WORTH THINKING OF;--
BUT IF HE, WHO HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN ALWAYS SO MUCH THE MOST IN LOVE
OF THE TWO, WERE TO BE RETURNING WITH THE SAME WARMTH OF SENTIMENT
WHICH HE HAD TAKEN AWAY, IT WOULD BE VERY DISTRESSING.  IF A SEPARATION
OF TWO MONTHS SHOULD NOT HAVE COOLED HIM, THERE WERE DANGERS AND EVILS
BEFORE HER:--CAUTION FOR HIM AND FOR HERSELF WOULD BE NECESSARY.
SHE DID NOT MEAN TO HAVE HER OWN AFFECTIONS ENTANGLED AGAIN,
AND IT WOULD BE INCUMBENT ON HER TO AVOID ANY ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS.

SHE WISHED SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO KEEP HIM FROM AN ABSOLUTE DECLARATION.
THAT WOULD BE SO VERY PAINFUL A CONCLUSION OF THEIR PRESENT ACQUAINTANCE!
AND YET, SHE COULD NOT HELP RATHER ANTICIPATING SOMETHING DECISIVE.
SHE FELT AS IF THE SPRING WOULD NOT PASS WITHOUT BRINGING A CRISIS,
AN EVENT, A SOMETHING TO ALTER HER PRESENT COMPOSED AND TRANQUIL STATE.

IT WAS NOT VERY LONG, THOUGH RATHER LONGER THAN MR. WESTON HAD FORESEEN,
BEFORE SHE HAD THE POWER OF FORMING SOME OPINION OF FRANK CHURCHILL'S
FEELINGS.  THE ENSCOMBE FAMILY WERE NOT IN TOWN QUITE SO SOON AS HAD
BEEN IMAGINED, BUT HE WAS AT HIGHBURY VERY SOON AFTERWARDS.  HE RODE
DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS; HE COULD NOT YET DO MORE; BUT AS HE CAME
FROM RANDALLS IMMEDIATELY TO HARTFIELD, SHE COULD THEN EXERCISE ALL
HER QUICK OBSERVATION, AND SPEEDILY DETERMINE HOW HE WAS INFLUENCED,
AND HOW SHE MUST ACT.  THEY MET WITH THE UTMOST FRIENDLINESS.
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF HIS GREAT PLEASURE IN SEEING HER.
BUT SHE HAD AN ALMOST INSTANT DOUBT OF HIS CARING FOR HER AS HE
HAD DONE, OF HIS FEELING THE SAME TENDERNESS IN THE SAME DEGREE.
SHE WATCHED HIM WELL.  IT WAS A CLEAR THING HE WAS LESS IN LOVE THAN HE
HAD BEEN.  ABSENCE, WITH THE CONVICTION PROBABLY OF HER INDIFFERENCE,
HAD PRODUCED THIS VERY NATURAL AND VERY DESIRABLE EFFECT.

HE WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS; AS READY TO TALK AND LAUGH AS EVER, AND SEEMED
DELIGHTED TO SPEAK OF HIS FORMER VISIT, AND RECUR TO OLD STORIES:
AND HE WAS NOT WITHOUT AGITATION.  IT WAS NOT IN HIS CALMNESS THAT
SHE READ HIS COMPARATIVE DIFFERENCE.  HE WAS NOT CALM; HIS SPIRITS
WERE EVIDENTLY FLUTTERED; THERE WAS RESTLESSNESS ABOUT HIM.
LIVELY AS HE WAS, IT SEEMED A LIVELINESS THAT DID NOT SATISFY HIMSELF;
BUT WHAT DECIDED HER BELIEF ON THE SUBJECT, WAS HIS STAYING ONLY A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR, AND HURRYING AWAY TO MAKE OTHER CALLS IN HIGHBURY.
"HE HAD SEEN A GROUP OF OLD ACQUAINTANCE IN THE STREET AS HE PASSED--
HE HAD NOT STOPPED, HE WOULD NOT STOP FOR MORE THAN A WORD--BUT HE
HAD THE VANITY TO THINK THEY WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IF HE DID NOT CALL,
AND MUCH AS HE WISHED TO STAY LONGER AT HARTFIELD, HE MUST HURRY OFF."
SHE HAD NO DOUBT AS TO HIS BEING LESS IN LOVE--BUT NEITHER HIS
AGITATED SPIRITS, NOR HIS HURRYING AWAY, SEEMED LIKE A PERFECT CURE;
AND SHE WAS RATHER INCLINED TO THINK IT IMPLIED A DREAD OF HER
RETURNING POWER, AND A DISCREET RESOLUTION OF NOT TRUSTING HIMSELF
WITH HER LONG.

THIS WAS THE ONLY VISIT FROM FRANK CHURCHILL IN THE COURSE OF TEN DAYS.
HE WAS OFTEN HOPING, INTENDING TO COME--BUT WAS ALWAYS PREVENTED.
HIS AUNT COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM LEAVE HER.  SUCH WAS HIS OWN ACCOUNT
AT RANDALL'S. IF HE WERE QUITE SINCERE, IF HE REALLY TRIED TO COME,
IT WAS TO BE INFERRED THAT MRS. CHURCHILL'S REMOVAL TO LONDON HAD
BEEN OF NO SERVICE TO THE WILFUL OR NERVOUS PART OF HER DISORDER.
THAT SHE WAS REALLY ILL WAS VERY CERTAIN; HE HAD DECLARED HIMSELF
CONVINCED OF IT, AT RANDALLS.  THOUGH MUCH MIGHT BE FANCY, HE COULD
NOT DOUBT, WHEN HE LOOKED BACK, THAT SHE WAS IN A WEAKER STATE
OF HEALTH THAN SHE HAD BEEN HALF A YEAR AGO.  HE DID NOT BELIEVE IT
TO PROCEED FROM ANY THING THAT CARE AND MEDICINE MIGHT NOT REMOVE,
OR AT LEAST THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE MANY YEARS OF EXISTENCE BEFORE HER;
BUT HE COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON, BY ALL HIS FATHER'S DOUBTS, TO SAY
THAT HER COMPLAINTS WERE MERELY IMAGINARY, OR THAT SHE WAS AS STRONG
AS EVER.

IT SOON APPEARED THAT LONDON WAS NOT THE PLACE FOR HER.  SHE COULD
NOT ENDURE ITS NOISE.  HER NERVES WERE UNDER CONTINUAL IRRITATION
AND SUFFERING; AND BY THE TEN DAYS' END, HER NEPHEW'S LETTER TO
RANDALLS COMMUNICATED A CHANGE OF PLAN.  THEY WERE GOING TO REMOVE
IMMEDIATELY TO RICHMOND.  MRS. CHURCHILL HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED
TO THE MEDICAL SKILL OF AN EMINENT PERSON THERE, AND HAD OTHERWISE
A FANCY FOR THE PLACE.  A READY-FURNISHED HOUSE IN A FAVOURITE
SPOT WAS ENGAGED, AND MUCH BENEFIT EXPECTED FROM THE CHANGE.

EMMA HEARD THAT FRANK WROTE IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS OF THIS ARRANGEMENT,
AND SEEMED MOST FULLY TO APPRECIATE THE BLESSING OF HAVING TWO
MONTHS BEFORE HIM OF SUCH NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD TO MANY DEAR FRIENDS--
FOR THE HOUSE WAS TAKEN FOR MAY AND JUNE.  SHE WAS TOLD THAT NOW
HE WROTE WITH THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE OF BEING OFTEN WITH THEM,
ALMOST AS OFTEN AS HE COULD EVEN WISH.

EMMA SAW HOW MR. WESTON UNDERSTOOD THESE JOYOUS PROSPECTS.  HE WAS
CONSIDERING HER AS THE SOURCE OF ALL THE HAPPINESS THEY OFFERED.
SHE HOPED IT WAS NOT SO.  TWO MONTHS MUST BRING IT TO THE PROOF.

MR. WESTON'S OWN HAPPINESS WAS INDISPUTABLE.  HE WAS QUITE DELIGHTED.
IT WAS THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE HE COULD HAVE WISHED FOR.  NOW, IT WOULD
BE REALLY HAVING FRANK IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD.  WHAT WERE NINE MILES
TO A YOUNG MAN?--AN HOUR'S RIDE.  HE WOULD BE ALWAYS COMING OVER.
THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT RESPECT OF RICHMOND AND LONDON WAS ENOUGH
TO MAKE THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF SEEING HIM ALWAYS AND SEEING
HIM NEVER.  SIXTEEN MILES--NAY, EIGHTEEN--IT MUST BE FULL EIGHTEEN
TO MANCHESTER-STREET--WAS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE.  WERE HE EVER ABLE
TO GET AWAY, THE DAY WOULD BE SPENT IN COMING AND RETURNING.
THERE WAS NO COMFORT IN HAVING HIM IN LONDON; HE MIGHT AS WELL BE
AT ENSCOMBE; BUT RICHMOND WAS THE VERY DISTANCE FOR EASY INTERCOURSE.
BETTER THAN NEARER!

ONE GOOD THING WAS IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT TO A CERTAINTY BY THIS REMOVAL,--
THE BALL AT THE CROWN.  IT HAD NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN BEFORE, BUT IT HAD
BEEN SOON ACKNOWLEDGED VAIN TO ATTEMPT TO FIX A DAY.  NOW, HOWEVER,
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TO BE; EVERY PREPARATION WAS RESUMED, AND VERY SOON
AFTER THE CHURCHILLS HAD REMOVED TO RICHMOND, A FEW LINES FROM FRANK,
TO SAY THAT HIS AUNT FELT ALREADY MUCH BETTER FOR THE CHANGE,
AND THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT OF BEING ABLE TO JOIN THEM FOR TWENTY-FOUR
HOURS AT ANY GIVEN TIME, INDUCED THEM TO NAME AS EARLY A DAY AS POSSIBLE.

MR. WESTON'S BALL WAS TO BE A REAL THING.  A VERY FEW TO-MORROWS
STOOD BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF HIGHBURY AND HAPPINESS.

MR. WOODHOUSE WAS RESIGNED.  THE TIME OF YEAR LIGHTENED THE EVIL
TO HIM.  MAY WAS BETTER FOR EVERY THING THAN FEBRUARY.  MRS. BATES
WAS ENGAGED TO SPEND THE EVENING AT HARTFIELD, JAMES HAD DUE NOTICE,
AND HE SANGUINELY HOPED THAT NEITHER DEAR LITTLE HENRY NOR DEAR
LITTLE JOHN WOULD HAVE ANY THING THE MATTER WITH THEM, WHILE DEAR
EMMA WERE GONE.



CHAPTER II


NO MISFORTUNE OCCURRED, AGAIN TO PREVENT THE BALL.  THE DAY APPROACHED,
THE DAY ARRIVED; AND AFTER A MORNING OF SOME ANXIOUS WATCHING,
FRANK CHURCHILL, IN ALL THE CERTAINTY OF HIS OWN SELF, REACHED RANDALLS
BEFORE DINNER, AND EVERY THING WAS SAFE.

NO SECOND MEETING HAD THERE YET BEEN BETWEEN HIM AND EMMA.
THE ROOM AT THE CROWN WAS TO WITNESS IT;--BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER
THAN A COMMON MEETING IN A CROWD.  MR. WESTON HAD BEEN SO VERY
EARNEST IN HIS ENTREATIES FOR HER ARRIVING THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AFTER THEMSELVES, FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAKING HER OPINION AS TO THE
PROPRIETY AND COMFORT OF THE ROOMS BEFORE ANY OTHER PERSONS CAME,
THAT SHE COULD NOT REFUSE HIM, AND MUST THEREFORE SPEND SOME QUIET
INTERVAL IN THE YOUNG MAN'S COMPANY.  SHE WAS TO CONVEY HARRIET,
AND THEY DROVE TO THE CROWN IN GOOD TIME, THE RANDALLS PARTY JUST
SUFFICIENTLY BEFORE THEM.

FRANK CHURCHILL SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ON THE WATCH; AND THOUGH
HE DID NOT SAY MUCH, HIS EYES DECLARED THAT HE MEANT TO HAVE
A DELIGHTFUL EVENING.  THEY ALL WALKED ABOUT TOGETHER, TO SEE
THAT EVERY THING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE; AND WITHIN A FEW MINUTES
WERE JOINED BY THE CONTENTS OF ANOTHER CARRIAGE, WHICH EMMA
COULD NOT HEAR THE SOUND OF AT FIRST, WITHOUT GREAT SURPRIZE.
"SO UNREASONABLY EARLY!" SHE WAS GOING TO EXCLAIM; BUT SHE PRESENTLY
FOUND THAT IT WAS A FAMILY OF OLD FRIENDS, WHO WERE COMING, LIKE HERSELF,
BY PARTICULAR DESIRE, TO HELP MR. WESTON'S JUDGMENT; AND THEY WERE
SO VERY CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER CARRIAGE OF COUSINS, WHO HAD BEEN
ENTREATED TO COME EARLY WITH THE SAME DISTINGUISHING EARNESTNESS,
ON THE SAME ERRAND, THAT IT SEEMED AS IF HALF THE COMPANY MIGHT
SOON BE COLLECTED TOGETHER FOR THE PURPOSE OF PREPARATORY INSPECTION.

EMMA PERCEIVED THAT HER TASTE WAS NOT THE ONLY TASTE ON WHICH
MR. WESTON DEPENDED, AND FELT, THAT TO BE THE FAVOURITE AND
INTIMATE OF A MAN WHO HAD SO MANY INTIMATES AND CONFIDANTES,
WAS NOT THE VERY FIRST DISTINCTION IN THE SCALE OF VANITY.
SHE LIKED HIS OPEN MANNERS, BUT A LITTLE LESS OF OPEN-HEARTEDNESS
WOULD HAVE MADE HIM A HIGHER CHARACTER.--GENERAL BENEVOLENCE,
BUT NOT GENERAL FRIENDSHIP, MADE A MAN WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE.--
SHE COULD FANCY SUCH A MAN.  THE WHOLE PARTY WALKED ABOUT,
AND LOOKED, AND PRAISED AGAIN; AND THEN, HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO,
FORMED A SORT OF HALF-CIRCLE ROUND THE FIRE, TO OBSERVE IN THEIR
VARIOUS MODES, TILL OTHER SUBJECTS WERE STARTED, THAT, THOUGH _MAY_,
A FIRE IN THE EVENING WAS STILL VERY PLEASANT.

EMMA FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT MR. WESTON'S FAULT THAT THE NUMBER
OF PRIVY COUNCILLORS WAS NOT YET LARGER.  THEY HAD STOPPED
AT MRS. BATES'S DOOR TO OFFER THE USE OF THEIR CARRIAGE,
BUT THE AUNT AND NIECE WERE TO BE BROUGHT BY THE ELTONS.

FRANK WAS STANDING BY HER, BUT NOT STEADILY; THERE WAS A RESTLESSNESS,
WHICH SHEWED A MIND NOT AT EASE.  HE WAS LOOKING ABOUT, HE WAS GOING
TO THE DOOR, HE WAS WATCHING FOR THE SOUND OF OTHER CARRIAGES,--
IMPATIENT TO BEGIN, OR AFRAID OF BEING ALWAYS NEAR HER.

MRS. ELTON WAS SPOKEN OF.  "I THINK SHE MUST BE HERE SOON," SAID HE.
"I HAVE A GREAT CURIOSITY TO SEE MRS. ELTON, I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH
OF HER.  IT CANNOT BE LONG, I THINK, BEFORE SHE COMES."

A CARRIAGE WAS HEARD.  HE WAS ON THE MOVE IMMEDIATELY;
BUT COMING BACK, SAID,

"I AM FORGETTING THAT I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH HER.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN
EITHER MR. OR MRS. ELTON.  I HAVE NO BUSINESS TO PUT MYSELF FORWARD."

MR. AND MRS. ELTON APPEARED; AND ALL THE SMILES AND THE PROPRIETIES PASSED.

"BUT MISS BATES AND MISS FAIRFAX!" SAID MR. WESTON, LOOKING ABOUT.
"WE THOUGHT YOU WERE TO BRING THEM."

THE MISTAKE HAD BEEN SLIGHT.  THE CARRIAGE WAS SENT FOR THEM NOW.
EMMA LONGED TO KNOW WHAT FRANK'S FIRST OPINION OF MRS. ELTON
MIGHT BE; HOW HE WAS AFFECTED BY THE STUDIED ELEGANCE OF HER DRESS,
AND HER SMILES OF GRACIOUSNESS.  HE WAS IMMEDIATELY QUALIFYING
HIMSELF TO FORM AN OPINION, BY GIVING HER VERY PROPER ATTENTION,
AFTER THE INTRODUCTION HAD PASSED.

IN A FEW MINUTES THE CARRIAGE RETURNED.--SOMEBODY TALKED OF RAIN.--
"I WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE UMBRELLAS, SIR," SAID FRANK TO HIS FATHER:
"MISS BATES MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN:"  AND AWAY HE WENT.  MR. WESTON
WAS FOLLOWING; BUT MRS. ELTON DETAINED HIM, TO GRATIFY HIM BY HER
OPINION OF HIS SON; AND SO BRISKLY DID SHE BEGIN, THAT THE YOUNG
MAN HIMSELF, THOUGH BY NO MEANS MOVING SLOWLY, COULD HARDLY BE OUT
OF HEARING.

"A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN INDEED, MR. WESTON.  YOU KNOW I CANDIDLY TOLD
YOU I SHOULD FORM MY OWN OPINION; AND I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT I AM
EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH HIM.--YOU MAY BELIEVE ME.  I NEVER COMPLIMENT.
I THINK HIM A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN, AND HIS MANNERS ARE PRECISELY
WHAT I LIKE AND APPROVE--SO TRULY THE GENTLEMAN, WITHOUT THE LEAST
CONCEIT OR PUPPYISM.  YOU MUST KNOW I HAVE A VAST DISLIKE TO PUPPIES--
QUITE A HORROR OF THEM.  THEY WERE NEVER TOLERATED AT MAPLE GROVE.
NEITHER MR. SUCKLING NOR ME HAD EVER ANY PATIENCE WITH THEM; AND WE
USED SOMETIMES TO SAY VERY CUTTING THINGS!  SELINA, WHO IS MILD ALMOST
TO A FAULT, BORE WITH THEM MUCH BETTER."

WHILE SHE TALKED OF HIS SON, MR. WESTON'S ATTENTION WAS CHAINED;
BUT WHEN SHE GOT TO MAPLE GROVE, HE COULD RECOLLECT THAT THERE WERE
LADIES JUST ARRIVING TO BE ATTENDED TO, AND WITH HAPPY SMILES MUST
HURRY AWAY.

MRS. ELTON TURNED TO MRS. WESTON.  "I HAVE NO DOUBT OF ITS BEING
OUR CARRIAGE WITH MISS BATES AND JANE.  OUR COACHMAN AND HORSES ARE
SO EXTREMELY EXPEDITIOUS!--I BELIEVE WE DRIVE FASTER THAN ANY BODY.--
WHAT A PLEASURE IT IS TO SEND ONE'S CARRIAGE FOR A FRIEND!--
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO OFFER, BUT ANOTHER TIME IT
WILL BE QUITE UNNECESSARY.  YOU MAY BE VERY SURE I SHALL ALWAYS
TAKE CARE OF _THEM_."

MISS BATES AND MISS FAIRFAX, ESCORTED BY THE TWO GENTLEMEN,
WALKED INTO THE ROOM; AND MRS. ELTON SEEMED TO THINK IT AS MUCH
HER DUTY AS MRS. WESTON'S TO RECEIVE THEM.  HER GESTURES AND
MOVEMENTS MIGHT BE UNDERSTOOD BY ANY ONE WHO LOOKED ON LIKE EMMA;
BUT HER WORDS, EVERY BODY'S WORDS, WERE SOON LOST UNDER THE
INCESSANT FLOW OF MISS BATES, WHO CAME IN TALKING, AND HAD NOT
FINISHED HER SPEECH UNDER MANY MINUTES AFTER HER BEING ADMITTED
INTO THE CIRCLE AT THE FIRE.  AS THE DOOR OPENED SHE WAS HEARD,

"SO VERY OBLIGING OF YOU!--NO RAIN AT ALL.  NOTHING TO SIGNIFY.
I DO NOT CARE FOR MYSELF.  QUITE THICK SHOES.  AND JANE DECLARES--
WELL!--(AS SOON AS SHE WAS WITHIN THE DOOR) WELL!  THIS IS BRILLIANT
INDEED!--THIS IS ADMIRABLE!--EXCELLENTLY CONTRIVED, UPON MY WORD.
NOTHING WANTING.  COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED IT.--SO WELL LIGHTED UP!--
JANE, JANE, LOOK!--DID YOU EVER SEE ANY THING?  OH!  MR. WESTON,
YOU MUST REALLY HAVE HAD ALADDIN'S LAMP.  GOOD MRS. STOKES
WOULD NOT KNOW HER OWN ROOM AGAIN.  I SAW HER AS I CAME IN;
SHE WAS STANDING IN THE ENTRANCE.  `OH!  MRS. STOKES,' SAID I--
BUT I HAD NOT TIME FOR MORE."  SHE WAS NOW MET BY MRS. WESTON.--
"VERY WELL, I THANK YOU, MA'AM. I HOPE YOU ARE QUITE WELL.
VERY HAPPY TO HEAR IT.  SO AFRAID YOU MIGHT HAVE A HEADACHE!--
SEEING YOU PASS BY SO OFTEN, AND KNOWING HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU MUST HAVE.
DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT INDEED.  AH! DEAR MRS. ELTON, SO OBLIGED
TO YOU FOR THE CARRIAGE!--EXCELLENT TIME.  JANE AND I QUITE READY.
DID NOT KEEP THE HORSES A MOMENT.  MOST COMFORTABLE CARRIAGE.--
OH! AND I AM SURE OUR THANKS ARE DUE TO YOU, MRS. WESTON, ON THAT SCORE.
MRS. ELTON HAD MOST KINDLY SENT JANE A NOTE, OR WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.--
BUT TWO SUCH OFFERS IN ONE DAY!--NEVER WERE SUCH NEIGHBOURS.
I SAID TO MY MOTHER, `UPON MY WORD, MA'AM--.'  THANK YOU, MY MOTHER
IS REMARKABLY WELL.  GONE TO MR. WOODHOUSE'S. I MADE HER TAKE
HER SHAWL--FOR THE EVENINGS ARE NOT WARM--HER LARGE NEW SHAWL--
MRS. DIXON'S WEDDING-PRESENT.--SO KIND OF HER TO THINK OF MY MOTHER!
BOUGHT AT WEYMOUTH, YOU KNOW--MR. DIXON'S CHOICE.  THERE WERE
THREE OTHERS, JANE SAYS, WHICH THEY HESITATED ABOUT SOME TIME.
COLONEL CAMPBELL RATHER PREFERRED AN OLIVE.  MY DEAR JANE,
ARE YOU SURE YOU DID NOT WET YOUR FEET?--IT WAS BUT A DROP OR TWO,
BUT I AM SO AFRAID:--BUT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL WAS SO EXTREMELY--
AND THERE WAS A MAT TO STEP UPON--I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIS
EXTREME POLITENESS.--OH!  MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, I MUST TELL YOU
MY MOTHER'S SPECTACLES HAVE NEVER BEEN IN FAULT SINCE; THE RIVET
NEVER CAME OUT AGAIN.  MY MOTHER OFTEN TALKS OF YOUR GOOD-NATURE.
DOES NOT SHE, JANE?--DO NOT WE OFTEN TALK OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL?--
AH! HERE'S MISS WOODHOUSE.--DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW DO YOU DO?--
VERY WELL I THANK YOU, QUITE WELL.  THIS IS MEETING QUITE IN FAIRY-LAND!--
SUCH A TRANSFORMATION!--MUST NOT COMPLIMENT, I KNOW (EYEING EMMA
MOST COMPLACENTLY)--THAT WOULD BE RUDE--BUT UPON MY WORD, MISS WOODHOUSE,
YOU DO LOOK--HOW DO YOU LIKE JANE'S HAIR?--YOU ARE A JUDGE.--
SHE DID IT ALL HERSELF.  QUITE WONDERFUL HOW SHE DOES HER HAIR!--
NO HAIRDRESSER FROM LONDON I THINK COULD.--AH! DR. HUGHES I DECLARE--
AND MRS. HUGHES.  MUST GO AND SPEAK TO DR. AND MRS. HUGHES FOR
A MOMENT.--HOW DO YOU DO?  HOW DO YOU DO?--VERY WELL, I THANK YOU.
THIS IS DELIGHTFUL, IS NOT IT?--WHERE'S DEAR MR. RICHARD?--
OH! THERE HE IS.  DON'T DISTURB HIM.  MUCH BETTER EMPLOYED TALKING
TO THE YOUNG LADIES.  HOW DO YOU DO, MR. RICHARD?--I SAW YOU THE
OTHER DAY AS YOU RODE THROUGH THE TOWN--MRS. OTWAY, I PROTEST!--
AND GOOD MR. OTWAY, AND MISS OTWAY AND MISS CAROLINE.--SUCH A HOST
OF FRIENDS!--AND MR. GEORGE AND MR. ARTHUR!--HOW DO YOU DO?  HOW DO
YOU ALL DO?--QUITE WELL, I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU.  NEVER BETTER.--
DON'T I HEAR ANOTHER CARRIAGE?--WHO CAN THIS BE?--VERY LIKELY THE
WORTHY COLES.--UPON MY WORD, THIS IS CHARMING TO BE STANDING ABOUT
AMONG SUCH FRIENDS!  AND SUCH A NOBLE FIRE!--I AM QUITE ROASTED.
NO COFFEE, I THANK YOU, FOR ME--NEVER TAKE COFFEE.--A LITTLE TEA
IF YOU PLEASE, SIR, BY AND BYE,--NO HURRY--OH! HERE IT COMES.
EVERY THING SO GOOD!"

FRANK CHURCHILL RETURNED TO HIS STATION BY EMMA; AND AS SOON AS MISS
BATES WAS QUIET, SHE FOUND HERSELF NECESSARILY OVERHEARING THE
DISCOURSE OF MRS. ELTON AND MISS FAIRFAX, WHO WERE STANDING A LITTLE
WAY BEHIND HER.--HE WAS THOUGHTFUL.  WHETHER HE WERE OVERHEARING TOO,
SHE COULD NOT DETERMINE.  AFTER A GOOD MANY COMPLIMENTS TO JANE
ON HER DRESS AND LOOK, COMPLIMENTS VERY QUIETLY AND PROPERLY TAKEN,
MRS. ELTON WAS EVIDENTLY WANTING TO BE COMPLIMENTED HERSELF--
AND IT WAS, "HOW DO YOU LIKE MY GOWN?--HOW DO YOU LIKE MY TRIMMING?--
HOW HAS WRIGHT DONE MY HAIR?"--WITH MANY OTHER RELATIVE QUESTIONS,
ALL ANSWERED WITH PATIENT POLITENESS.  MRS. ELTON THEN SAID,
"NOBODY CAN THINK LESS OF DRESS IN GENERAL THAN I DO--BUT UPON SUCH
AN OCCASION AS THIS, WHEN EVERY BODY'S EYES ARE SO MUCH UPON ME,
AND IN COMPLIMENT TO THE WESTONS--WHO I HAVE NO DOUBT ARE GIVING
THIS BALL CHIEFLY TO DO ME HONOUR--I WOULD NOT WISH TO BE INFERIOR
TO OTHERS.  AND I SEE VERY FEW PEARLS IN THE ROOM EXCEPT MINE.--
SO FRANK CHURCHILL IS A CAPITAL DANCER, I UNDERSTAND.--WE SHALL SEE
IF OUR STYLES SUIT.--A FINE YOUNG MAN CERTAINLY IS FRANK CHURCHILL.
I LIKE HIM VERY WELL."

AT THIS MOMENT FRANK BEGAN TALKING SO VIGOROUSLY, THAT EMMA COULD
NOT BUT IMAGINE HE HAD OVERHEARD HIS OWN PRAISES, AND DID NOT WANT
TO HEAR MORE;--AND THE VOICES OF THE LADIES WERE DROWNED FOR A WHILE,
TILL ANOTHER SUSPENSION BROUGHT MRS. ELTON'S TONES AGAIN DISTINCTLY
FORWARD.--MR. ELTON HAD JUST JOINED THEM, AND HIS WIFE WAS EXCLAIMING,

"OH! YOU HAVE FOUND US OUT AT LAST, HAVE YOU, IN OUR SECLUSION?--
I WAS THIS MOMENT TELLING JANE, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BEGIN TO BE
IMPATIENT FOR TIDINGS OF US."

"JANE!"--REPEATED FRANK CHURCHILL, WITH A LOOK OF SURPRIZE AND DISPLEASURE.--
"THAT IS EASY--BUT MISS FAIRFAX DOES NOT DISAPPROVE IT, I SUPPOSE."

"HOW DO YOU LIKE MRS. ELTON?" SAID EMMA IN A WHISPER.

"NOT AT ALL."

"YOU ARE UNGRATEFUL."

"UNGRATEFUL!--WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"  THEN CHANGING FROM A FROWN TO
A SMILE--"NO, DO NOT TELL ME--I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.--
WHERE IS MY FATHER?--WHEN ARE WE TO BEGIN DANCING?"

EMMA COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND HIM; HE SEEMED IN AN ODD HUMOUR.
HE WALKED OFF TO FIND HIS FATHER, BUT WAS QUICKLY BACK AGAIN WITH BOTH
MR. AND MRS. WESTON.  HE HAD MET WITH THEM IN A LITTLE PERPLEXITY,
WHICH MUST BE LAID BEFORE EMMA.  IT HAD JUST OCCURRED TO MRS. WESTON
THAT MRS. ELTON MUST BE ASKED TO BEGIN THE BALL; THAT SHE WOULD
EXPECT IT; WHICH INTERFERED WITH ALL THEIR WISHES OF GIVING EMMA
THAT DISTINCTION.--EMMA HEARD THE SAD TRUTH WITH FORTITUDE.

"AND WHAT ARE WE TO DO FOR A PROPER PARTNER FOR HER?" SAID MR. WESTON.
"SHE WILL THINK FRANK OUGHT TO ASK HER."

FRANK TURNED INSTANTLY TO EMMA, TO CLAIM HER FORMER PROMISE;
AND BOASTED HIMSELF AN ENGAGED MAN, WHICH HIS FATHER LOOKED HIS MOST
PERFECT APPROBATION OF--AND IT THEN APPEARED THAT MRS. WESTON WAS
WANTING _HIM_ TO DANCE WITH MRS. ELTON HIMSELF, AND THAT THEIR BUSINESS
WAS TO HELP TO PERSUADE HIM INTO IT, WHICH WAS DONE PRETTY SOON.--
MR. WESTON AND MRS. ELTON LED THE WAY, MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS
WOODHOUSE FOLLOWED.  EMMA MUST SUBMIT TO STAND SECOND TO MRS. ELTON,
THOUGH SHE HAD ALWAYS CONSIDERED THE BALL AS PECULIARLY FOR HER.
IT WAS ALMOST ENOUGH TO MAKE HER THINK OF MARRYING.  MRS. ELTON HAD
UNDOUBTEDLY THE ADVANTAGE, AT THIS TIME, IN VANITY COMPLETELY GRATIFIED;
FOR THOUGH SHE HAD INTENDED TO BEGIN WITH FRANK CHURCHILL, SHE COULD
NOT LOSE BY THE CHANGE.  MR. WESTON MIGHT BE HIS SON'S SUPERIOR.--
IN SPITE OF THIS LITTLE RUB, HOWEVER, EMMA WAS SMILING WITH ENJOYMENT,
DELIGHTED TO SEE THE RESPECTABLE LENGTH OF THE SET AS IT WAS FORMING,
AND TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD SO MANY HOURS OF UNUSUAL FESTIVITY BEFORE HER.--
SHE WAS MORE DISTURBED BY MR. KNIGHTLEY'S NOT DANCING THAN BY ANY
THING ELSE.--THERE HE WAS, AMONG THE STANDERS-BY, WHERE HE OUGHT NOT
TO BE; HE OUGHT TO BE DANCING,--NOT CLASSING HIMSELF WITH THE HUSBANDS,
AND FATHERS, AND WHIST-PLAYERS, WHO WERE PRETENDING TO FEEL AN INTEREST
IN THE DANCE TILL THEIR RUBBERS WERE MADE UP,--SO YOUNG AS HE LOOKED!--
HE COULD NOT HAVE APPEARED TO GREATER ADVANTAGE PERHAPS ANYWHERE,
THAN WHERE HE HAD PLACED HIMSELF.  HIS TALL, FIRM, UPRIGHT FIGURE,
AMONG THE BULKY FORMS AND STOOPING SHOULDERS OF THE ELDERLY MEN,
WAS SUCH AS EMMA FELT MUST DRAW EVERY BODY'S EYES; AND, EXCEPTING HER
OWN PARTNER, THERE WAS NOT ONE AMONG THE WHOLE ROW OF YOUNG MEN
WHO COULD BE COMPARED WITH HIM.--HE MOVED A FEW STEPS NEARER,
AND THOSE FEW STEPS WERE ENOUGH TO PROVE IN HOW GENTLEMANLIKE
A MANNER, WITH WHAT NATURAL GRACE, HE MUST HAVE DANCED, WOULD HE
BUT TAKE THE TROUBLE.--WHENEVER SHE CAUGHT HIS EYE, SHE FORCED HIM
TO SMILE; BUT IN GENERAL HE WAS LOOKING GRAVE.  SHE WISHED HE COULD
LOVE A BALLROOM BETTER, AND COULD LIKE FRANK CHURCHILL BETTER.--
HE SEEMED OFTEN OBSERVING HER.  SHE MUST NOT FLATTER HERSELF THAT HE
THOUGHT OF HER DANCING, BUT IF HE WERE CRITICISING HER BEHAVIOUR,
SHE DID NOT FEEL AFRAID.  THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE FLIRTATION BETWEEN
HER AND HER PARTNER.  THEY SEEMED MORE LIKE CHEERFUL, EASY FRIENDS,
THAN LOVERS.  THAT FRANK CHURCHILL THOUGHT LESS OF HER THAN HE HAD DONE,
WAS INDUBITABLE.

THE BALL PROCEEDED PLEASANTLY.  THE ANXIOUS CARES, THE INCESSANT
ATTENTIONS OF MRS. WESTON, WERE NOT THROWN AWAY.  EVERY BODY
SEEMED HAPPY; AND THE PRAISE OF BEING A DELIGHTFUL BALL,
WHICH IS SELDOM BESTOWED TILL AFTER A BALL HAS CEASED TO BE,
WAS REPEATEDLY GIVEN IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS.
OF VERY IMPORTANT, VERY RECORDABLE EVENTS, IT WAS NOT MORE PRODUCTIVE
THAN SUCH MEETINGS USUALLY ARE.  THERE WAS ONE, HOWEVER, WHICH EMMA
THOUGHT SOMETHING OF.--THE TWO LAST DANCES BEFORE SUPPER WERE BEGUN,
AND HARRIET HAD NO PARTNER;--THE ONLY YOUNG LADY SITTING DOWN;--
AND SO EQUAL HAD BEEN HITHERTO THE NUMBER OF DANCERS, THAT HOW THERE
COULD BE ANY ONE DISENGAGED WAS THE WONDER!--BUT EMMA'S WONDER
LESSENED SOON AFTERWARDS, ON SEEING MR. ELTON SAUNTERING ABOUT.
HE WOULD NOT ASK HARRIET TO DANCE IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO BE AVOIDED:
SHE WAS SURE HE WOULD NOT--AND SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM EVERY MOMENT TO
ESCAPE INTO THE CARD-ROOM.

ESCAPE, HOWEVER, WAS NOT HIS PLAN.  HE CAME TO THE PART OF THE ROOM
WHERE THE SITTERS-BY WERE COLLECTED, SPOKE TO SOME, AND WALKED ABOUT
IN FRONT OF THEM, AS IF TO SHEW HIS LIBERTY, AND HIS RESOLUTION
OF MAINTAINING IT.  HE DID NOT OMIT BEING SOMETIMES DIRECTLY
BEFORE MISS SMITH, OR SPEAKING TO THOSE WHO WERE CLOSE TO HER.--
EMMA SAW IT.  SHE WAS NOT YET DANCING; SHE WAS WORKING HER WAY
UP FROM THE BOTTOM, AND HAD THEREFORE LEISURE TO LOOK AROUND,
AND BY ONLY TURNING HER HEAD A LITTLE SHE SAW IT ALL.  WHEN SHE WAS
HALF-WAY UP THE SET, THE WHOLE GROUP WERE EXACTLY BEHIND HER, AND SHE
WOULD NO LONGER ALLOW HER EYES TO WATCH; BUT MR. ELTON WAS SO NEAR,
THAT SHE HEARD EVERY SYLLABLE OF A DIALOGUE WHICH JUST THEN TOOK
PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND MRS. WESTON; AND SHE PERCEIVED THAT HIS WIFE,
WHO WAS STANDING IMMEDIATELY ABOVE HER, WAS NOT ONLY LISTENING ALSO,
BUT EVEN ENCOURAGING HIM BY SIGNIFICANT GLANCES.--THE KIND-HEARTED,
GENTLE MRS. WESTON HAD LEFT HER SEAT TO JOIN HIM AND SAY, "DO NOT
YOU DANCE, MR. ELTON?" TO WHICH HIS PROMPT REPLY WAS, "MOST READILY,
MRS. WESTON, IF YOU WILL DANCE WITH ME."

"ME!--OH! NO--I WOULD GET YOU A BETTER PARTNER THAN MYSELF.
I AM NO DANCER."

"IF MRS. GILBERT WISHES TO DANCE," SAID HE, "I SHALL HAVE GREAT PLEASURE,
I AM SURE--FOR, THOUGH BEGINNING TO FEEL MYSELF RATHER AN OLD MARRIED MAN,
AND THAT MY DANCING DAYS ARE OVER, IT WOULD GIVE ME VERY GREAT
PLEASURE AT ANY TIME TO STAND UP WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE MRS. GILBERT."

"MRS. GILBERT DOES NOT MEAN TO DANCE, BUT THERE IS A YOUNG LADY
DISENGAGED WHOM I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO SEE DANCING--MISS SMITH."
"MISS SMITH!--OH!--I HAD NOT OBSERVED.--YOU ARE EXTREMELY OBLIGING--
AND IF I WERE NOT AN OLD MARRIED MAN.--BUT MY DANCING DAYS ARE OVER,
MRS. WESTON.  YOU WILL EXCUSE ME.  ANY THING ELSE I SHOULD BE MOST HAPPY
TO DO, AT YOUR COMMAND--BUT MY DANCING DAYS ARE OVER."

MRS. WESTON SAID NO MORE; AND EMMA COULD IMAGINE WITH WHAT
SURPRIZE AND MORTIFICATION SHE MUST BE RETURNING TO HER SEAT.
THIS WAS MR. ELTON! THE AMIABLE, OBLIGING, GENTLE MR. ELTON.--
SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR A MOMENT; HE HAD JOINED MR. KNIGHTLEY AT A
LITTLE DISTANCE, AND WAS ARRANGING HIMSELF FOR SETTLED CONVERSATION,
WHILE SMILES OF HIGH GLEE PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE.

SHE WOULD NOT LOOK AGAIN.  HER HEART WAS IN A GLOW, AND SHE FEARED
HER FACE MIGHT BE AS HOT.

IN ANOTHER MOMENT A HAPPIER SIGHT CAUGHT HER;--MR. KNIGHTLEY
LEADING HARRIET TO THE SET!--NEVER HAD SHE BEEN MORE SURPRIZED,
SELDOM MORE DELIGHTED, THAN AT THAT INSTANT.  SHE WAS ALL PLEASURE
AND GRATITUDE, BOTH FOR HARRIET AND HERSELF, AND LONGED TO BE
THANKING HIM; AND THOUGH TOO DISTANT FOR SPEECH, HER COUNTENANCE
SAID MUCH, AS SOON AS SHE COULD CATCH HIS EYE AGAIN.

HIS DANCING PROVED TO BE JUST WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED IT,
EXTREMELY GOOD; AND HARRIET WOULD HAVE SEEMED ALMOST TOO LUCKY,
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE CRUEL STATE OF THINGS BEFORE, AND FOR
THE VERY COMPLETE ENJOYMENT AND VERY HIGH SENSE OF THE DISTINCTION
WHICH HER HAPPY FEATURES ANNOUNCED.  IT WAS NOT THROWN AWAY ON HER,
SHE BOUNDED HIGHER THAN EVER, FLEW FARTHER DOWN THE MIDDLE,
AND WAS IN A CONTINUAL COURSE OF SMILES.

MR. ELTON HAD RETREATED INTO THE CARD-ROOM, LOOKING (EMMA TRUSTED)
VERY FOOLISH.  SHE DID NOT THINK HE WAS QUITE SO HARDENED AS HIS WIFE,
THOUGH GROWING VERY LIKE HER;--_SHE_ SPOKE SOME OF HER FEELINGS,
BY OBSERVING AUDIBLY TO HER PARTNER,

"KNIGHTLEY HAS TAKEN PITY ON POOR LITTLE MISS SMITH!--VERY GOODNATURED,
I DECLARE."

SUPPER WAS ANNOUNCED.  THE MOVE BEGAN; AND MISS BATES MIGHT BE
HEARD FROM THAT MOMENT, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, TILL HER BEING
SEATED AT TABLE AND TAKING UP HER SPOON.

"JANE, JANE, MY DEAR JANE, WHERE ARE YOU?--HERE IS YOUR TIPPET.
MRS. WESTON BEGS YOU TO PUT ON YOUR TIPPET.  SHE SAYS SHE IS AFRAID
THERE WILL BE DRAUGHTS IN THE PASSAGE, THOUGH EVERY THING HAS
BEEN DONE--ONE DOOR NAILED UP--QUANTITIES OF MATTING--MY DEAR JANE,
INDEED YOU MUST.  MR. CHURCHILL, OH! YOU ARE TOO OBLIGING!
HOW WELL YOU PUT IT ON!--SO GRATIFIED!  EXCELLENT DANCING INDEED!--
YES, MY DEAR, I RAN HOME, AS I SAID I SHOULD, TO HELP GRANDMAMA
TO BED, AND GOT BACK AGAIN, AND NOBODY MISSED ME.--I SET OFF WITHOUT
SAYING A WORD, JUST AS I TOLD YOU.  GRANDMAMA WAS QUITE WELL,
HAD A CHARMING EVENING WITH MR. WOODHOUSE, A VAST DEAL OF CHAT,
AND BACKGAMMON.--TEA WAS MADE DOWNSTAIRS, BISCUITS AND BAKED APPLES
AND WINE BEFORE SHE CAME AWAY:  AMAZING LUCK IN SOME OF HER THROWS:
AND SHE INQUIRED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOU, HOW YOU WERE AMUSED,
AND WHO WERE YOUR PARTNERS.  `OH!' SAID I, `I SHALL NOT FORESTALL JANE;
I LEFT HER DANCING WITH MR. GEORGE OTWAY; SHE WILL LOVE TO TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT IT HERSELF TO-MORROW: HER FIRST PARTNER WAS MR. ELTON,
I DO NOT KNOW WHO WILL ASK HER NEXT, PERHAPS MR. WILLIAM COX.'
MY DEAR SIR, YOU ARE TOO OBLIGING.--IS THERE NOBODY YOU WOULD
NOT RATHER?--I AM NOT HELPLESS.  SIR, YOU ARE MOST KIND.  UPON MY WORD,
JANE ON ONE ARM, AND ME ON THE OTHER!--STOP, STOP, LET US STAND
A LITTLE BACK, MRS. ELTON IS GOING; DEAR MRS. ELTON, HOW ELEGANT
SHE LOOKS!--BEAUTIFUL LACE!--NOW WE ALL FOLLOW IN HER TRAIN.
QUITE THE QUEEN OF THE EVENING!--WELL, HERE WE ARE AT THE PASSAGE.
TWO STEPS, JANE, TAKE CARE OF THE TWO STEPS.  OH! NO, THERE IS
BUT ONE.  WELL, I WAS PERSUADED THERE WERE TWO.  HOW VERY ODD!
I WAS CONVINCED THERE WERE TWO, AND THERE IS BUT ONE.  I NEVER SAW ANY
THING EQUAL TO THE COMFORT AND STYLE--CANDLES EVERYWHERE.--I WAS TELLING
YOU OF YOUR GRANDMAMA, JANE,--THERE WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT.--
THE BAKED APPLES AND BISCUITS, EXCELLENT IN THEIR WAY, YOU KNOW;
BUT THERE WAS A DELICATE FRICASSEE OF SWEETBREAD AND SOME ASPARAGUS
BROUGHT IN AT FIRST, AND GOOD MR. WOODHOUSE, NOT THINKING THE
ASPARAGUS QUITE BOILED ENOUGH, SENT IT ALL OUT AGAIN.  NOW THERE
IS NOTHING GRANDMAMA LOVES BETTER THAN SWEETBREAD AND ASPARAGUS--
SO SHE WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED, BUT WE AGREED WE WOULD NOT SPEAK OF IT
TO ANY BODY, FOR FEAR OF ITS GETTING ROUND TO DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE,
WHO WOULD BE SO VERY MUCH CONCERNED!--WELL, THIS IS BRILLIANT!
I AM ALL AMAZEMENT! COULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED ANY THING!--SUCH
ELEGANCE AND PROFUSION!--I HAVE SEEN NOTHING LIKE IT SINCE--
WELL, WHERE SHALL WE SIT? WHERE SHALL WE SIT?  ANYWHERE, SO THAT
JANE IS NOT IN A DRAUGHT.  WHERE _I_ SIT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE.
OH! DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS SIDE?--WELL, I AM SURE, MR. CHURCHILL--
ONLY IT SEEMS TOO GOOD--BUT JUST AS YOU PLEASE.  WHAT YOU DIRECT
IN THIS HOUSE CANNOT BE WRONG.  DEAR JANE, HOW SHALL WE EVER
RECOLLECT HALF THE DISHES FOR GRANDMAMA?  SOUP TOO!  BLESS ME!
I SHOULD NOT BE HELPED SO SOON, BUT IT SMELLS MOST EXCELLENT, AND I
CANNOT HELP BEGINNING."

EMMA HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO MR. KNIGHTLEY TILL
AFTER SUPPER; BUT, WHEN THEY WERE ALL IN THE BALLROOM AGAIN,
HER EYES INVITED HIM IRRESISTIBLY TO COME TO HER AND BE THANKED.
HE WAS WARM IN HIS REPROBATION OF MR. ELTON'S CONDUCT; IT HAD BEEN
UNPARDONABLE RUDENESS; AND MRS. ELTON'S LOOKS ALSO RECEIVED THE DUE
SHARE OF CENSURE.

"THEY AIMED AT WOUNDING MORE THAN HARRIET," SAID HE.  "EMMA, WHY
IS IT THAT THEY ARE YOUR ENEMIES?"

HE LOOKED WITH SMILING PENETRATION; AND, ON RECEIVING
NO ANSWER, ADDED, "_SHE_ OUGHT NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH YOU, I SUSPECT,
WHATEVER HE MAY BE.--TO THAT SURMISE, YOU SAY NOTHING, OF COURSE;
BUT CONFESS, EMMA, THAT YOU DID WANT HIM TO MARRY HARRIET."

"I DID," REPLIED EMMA, "AND THEY CANNOT FORGIVE ME."

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD; BUT THERE WAS A SMILE OF INDULGENCE WITH IT,
AND HE ONLY SAID,

"I SHALL NOT SCOLD YOU.  I LEAVE YOU TO YOUR OWN REFLECTIONS."

"CAN YOU TRUST ME WITH SUCH FLATTERERS?--DOES MY VAIN SPIRIT EVER
TELL ME I AM WRONG?"

"NOT YOUR VAIN SPIRIT, BUT YOUR SERIOUS SPIRIT.--IF ONE LEADS
YOU WRONG, I AM SURE THE OTHER TELLS YOU OF IT."

"I DO OWN MYSELF TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY MISTAKEN IN MR. ELTON.
THERE IS A LITTLENESS ABOUT HIM WHICH YOU DISCOVERED, AND WHICH I
DID NOT:  AND I WAS FULLY CONVINCED OF HIS BEING IN LOVE WITH HARRIET.
IT WAS THROUGH A SERIES OF STRANGE BLUNDERS!"

"AND, IN RETURN FOR YOUR ACKNOWLEDGING SO MUCH, I WILL DO YOU THE JUSTICE
TO SAY, THAT YOU WOULD HAVE CHOSEN FOR HIM BETTER THAN HE HAS CHOSEN FOR
HIMSELF.--HARRIET SMITH HAS SOME FIRST-RATE QUALITIES, WHICH MRS. ELTON
IS TOTALLY WITHOUT.  AN UNPRETENDING, SINGLE-MINDED, ARTLESS GIRL--
INFINITELY TO BE PREFERRED BY ANY MAN OF SENSE AND TASTE TO SUCH
A WOMAN AS MRS. ELTON.  I FOUND HARRIET MORE CONVERSABLE THAN I EXPECTED."

EMMA WAS EXTREMELY GRATIFIED.--THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE BUSTLE
OF MR. WESTON CALLING ON EVERY BODY TO BEGIN DANCING AGAIN.

"COME MISS WOODHOUSE, MISS OTWAY, MISS FAIRFAX, WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING?--
COME EMMA, SET YOUR COMPANIONS THE EXAMPLE.  EVERY BODY IS LAZY!
EVERY BODY IS ASLEEP!"

"I AM READY," SAID EMMA, "WHENEVER I AM WANTED."

"WHOM ARE YOU GOING TO DANCE WITH?" ASKED MR. KNIGHTLEY.

SHE HESITATED A MOMENT, AND THEN REPLIED, "WITH YOU, IF YOU WILL
ASK ME."

"WILL YOU?" SAID HE, OFFERING HIS HAND.

"INDEED I WILL.  YOU HAVE SHEWN THAT YOU CAN DANCE, AND YOU KNOW WE
ARE NOT REALLY SO MUCH BROTHER AND SISTER AS TO MAKE IT AT ALL IMPROPER."

"BROTHER AND SISTER! NO, INDEED."



CHAPTER III


THIS LITTLE EXPLANATION WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY GAVE EMMA CONSIDERABLE
PLEASURE.  IT WAS ONE OF THE AGREEABLE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE BALL,
WHICH SHE WALKED ABOUT THE LAWN THE NEXT MORNING TO ENJOY.--SHE WAS
EXTREMELY GLAD THAT THEY HAD COME TO SO GOOD AN UNDERSTANDING RESPECTING
THE ELTONS, AND THAT THEIR OPINIONS OF BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE WERE SO
MUCH ALIKE; AND HIS PRAISE OF HARRIET, HIS CONCESSION IN HER FAVOUR,
WAS PECULIARLY GRATIFYING.  THE IMPERTINENCE OF THE ELTONS, WHICH FOR
A FEW MINUTES HAD THREATENED TO RUIN THE REST OF HER EVENING, HAD BEEN
THE OCCASION OF SOME OF ITS HIGHEST SATISFACTIONS; AND SHE LOOKED
FORWARD TO ANOTHER HAPPY RESULT--THE CURE OF HARRIET'S INFATUATION.--
FROM HARRIET'S MANNER OF SPEAKING OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE BEFORE THEY
QUITTED THE BALLROOM, SHE HAD STRONG HOPES.  IT SEEMED AS IF HER EYES
WERE SUDDENLY OPENED, AND SHE WERE ENABLED TO SEE THAT MR. ELTON
WAS NOT THE SUPERIOR CREATURE SHE HAD BELIEVED HIM.  THE FEVER
WAS OVER, AND EMMA COULD HARBOUR LITTLE FEAR OF THE PULSE BEING
QUICKENED AGAIN BY INJURIOUS COURTESY.  SHE DEPENDED ON THE EVIL
FEELINGS OF THE ELTONS FOR SUPPLYING ALL THE DISCIPLINE OF POINTED
NEGLECT THAT COULD BE FARTHER REQUISITE.--HARRIET RATIONAL,
FRANK CHURCHILL NOT TOO MUCH IN LOVE, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY NOT
WANTING TO QUARREL WITH HER, HOW VERY HAPPY A SUMMER MUST BE BEFORE HER!

SHE WAS NOT TO SEE FRANK CHURCHILL THIS MORNING.  HE HAD TOLD
HER THAT HE COULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF STOPPING
AT HARTFIELD, AS HE WAS TO BE AT HOME BY THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
SHE DID NOT REGRET IT.

HAVING ARRANGED ALL THESE MATTERS, LOOKED THEM THROUGH, AND PUT THEM ALL
TO RIGHTS, SHE WAS JUST TURNING TO THE HOUSE WITH SPIRITS FRESHENED UP
FOR THE DEMANDS OF THE TWO LITTLE BOYS, AS WELL AS OF THEIR GRANDPAPA,
WHEN THE GREAT IRON SWEEP-GATE OPENED, AND TWO PERSONS ENTERED
WHOM SHE HAD NEVER LESS EXPECTED TO SEE TOGETHER--FRANK CHURCHILL,
WITH HARRIET LEANING ON HIS ARM--ACTUALLY HARRIET!--A MOMENT
SUFFICED TO CONVINCE HER THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY HAD HAPPENED.
HARRIET LOOKED WHITE AND FRIGHTENED, AND HE WAS TRYING TO CHEER HER.--
THE IRON GATES AND THE FRONT-DOOR WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS ASUNDER;--
THEY WERE ALL THREE SOON IN THE HALL, AND HARRIET IMMEDIATELY SINKING
INTO A CHAIR FAINTED AWAY.

A YOUNG LADY WHO FAINTS, MUST BE RECOVERED; QUESTIONS MUST BE ANSWERED,
AND SURPRIZES BE EXPLAINED.  SUCH EVENTS ARE VERY INTERESTING,
BUT THE SUSPENSE OF THEM CANNOT LAST LONG.  A FEW MINUTES MADE EMMA
ACQUAINTED WITH THE WHOLE.

MISS SMITH, AND MISS BICKERTON, ANOTHER PARLOUR BOARDER AT
MRS. GODDARD'S, WHO HAD BEEN ALSO AT THE BALL, HAD WALKED OUT TOGETHER,
AND TAKEN A ROAD, THE RICHMOND ROAD, WHICH, THOUGH APPARENTLY PUBLIC
ENOUGH FOR SAFETY, HAD LED THEM INTO ALARM.--ABOUT HALF A MILE
BEYOND HIGHBURY, MAKING A SUDDEN TURN, AND DEEPLY SHADED BY ELMS
ON EACH SIDE, IT BECAME FOR A CONSIDERABLE STRETCH VERY RETIRED;
AND WHEN THE YOUNG LADIES HAD ADVANCED SOME WAY INTO IT,
THEY HAD SUDDENLY PERCEIVED AT A SMALL DISTANCE BEFORE THEM,
ON A BROADER PATCH OF GREENSWARD BY THE SIDE, A PARTY OF GIPSIES.
A CHILD ON THE WATCH, CAME TOWARDS THEM TO BEG; AND MISS BICKERTON,
EXCESSIVELY FRIGHTENED, GAVE A GREAT SCREAM, AND CALLING ON HARRIET
TO FOLLOW HER, RAN UP A STEEP BANK, CLEARED A SLIGHT HEDGE AT THE TOP,
AND MADE THE BEST OF HER WAY BY A SHORT CUT BACK TO HIGHBURY.
BUT POOR HARRIET COULD NOT FOLLOW.  SHE HAD SUFFERED VERY MUCH
FROM CRAMP AFTER DANCING, AND HER FIRST ATTEMPT TO MOUNT THE BANK
BROUGHT ON SUCH A RETURN OF IT AS MADE HER ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS--
AND IN THIS STATE, AND EXCEEDINGLY TERRIFIED, SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED
TO REMAIN.

HOW THE TRAMPERS MIGHT HAVE BEHAVED, HAD THE YOUNG LADIES BEEN
MORE COURAGEOUS, MUST BE DOUBTFUL; BUT SUCH AN INVITATION FOR ATTACK
COULD NOT BE RESISTED; AND HARRIET WAS SOON ASSAILED BY HALF A
DOZEN CHILDREN, HEADED BY A STOUT WOMAN AND A GREAT BOY, ALL CLAMOROUS,
AND IMPERTINENT IN LOOK, THOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY IN WORD.--MORE AND
MORE FRIGHTENED, SHE IMMEDIATELY PROMISED THEM MONEY, AND TAKING OUT
HER PURSE, GAVE THEM A SHILLING, AND BEGGED THEM NOT TO WANT MORE,
OR TO USE HER ILL.--SHE WAS THEN ABLE TO WALK, THOUGH BUT SLOWLY,
AND WAS MOVING AWAY--BUT HER TERROR AND HER PURSE WERE TOO TEMPTING,
AND SHE WAS FOLLOWED, OR RATHER SURROUNDED, BY THE WHOLE GANG,
DEMANDING MORE.

IN THIS STATE FRANK CHURCHILL HAD FOUND HER, SHE TREMBLING
AND CONDITIONING, THEY LOUD AND INSOLENT.  BY A MOST FORTUNATE
CHANCE HIS LEAVING HIGHBURY HAD BEEN DELAYED SO AS TO BRING HIM
TO HER ASSISTANCE AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT.  THE PLEASANTNESS
OF THE MORNING HAD INDUCED HIM TO WALK FORWARD, AND LEAVE HIS
HORSES TO MEET HIM BY ANOTHER ROAD, A MILE OR TWO BEYOND HIGHBURY--
AND HAPPENING TO HAVE BORROWED A PAIR OF SCISSORS THE NIGHT BEFORE
OF MISS BATES, AND TO HAVE FORGOTTEN TO RESTORE THEM, HE HAD
BEEN OBLIGED TO STOP AT HER DOOR, AND GO IN FOR A FEW MINUTES:
HE WAS THEREFORE LATER THAN HE HAD INTENDED; AND BEING ON FOOT,
WAS UNSEEN BY THE WHOLE PARTY TILL ALMOST CLOSE TO THEM.
THE TERROR WHICH THE WOMAN AND BOY HAD BEEN CREATING IN HARRIET
WAS THEN THEIR OWN PORTION.  HE HAD LEFT THEM COMPLETELY FRIGHTENED;
AND HARRIET EAGERLY CLINGING TO HIM, AND HARDLY ABLE TO SPEAK,
HAD JUST STRENGTH ENOUGH TO REACH HARTFIELD, BEFORE HER SPIRITS
WERE QUITE OVERCOME.  IT WAS HIS IDEA TO BRING HER TO HARTFIELD:
HE HAD THOUGHT OF NO OTHER PLACE.

THIS WAS THE AMOUNT OF THE WHOLE STORY,--OF HIS COMMUNICATION AND
OF HARRIET'S AS SOON AS SHE HAD RECOVERED HER SENSES AND SPEECH.--
HE DARED NOT STAY LONGER THAN TO SEE HER WELL; THESE SEVERAL DELAYS
LEFT HIM NOT ANOTHER MINUTE TO LOSE; AND EMMA ENGAGING TO GIVE
ASSURANCE OF HER SAFETY TO MRS. GODDARD, AND NOTICE OF THERE
BEING SUCH A SET OF PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO MR. KNIGHTLEY,
HE SET OFF, WITH ALL THE GRATEFUL BLESSINGS THAT SHE COULD UTTER
FOR HER FRIEND AND HERSELF.

SUCH AN ADVENTURE AS THIS,--A FINE YOUNG MAN AND A LOVELY YOUNG
WOMAN THROWN TOGETHER IN SUCH A WAY, COULD HARDLY FAIL OF SUGGESTING
CERTAIN IDEAS TO THE COLDEST HEART AND THE STEADIEST BRAIN.
SO EMMA THOUGHT, AT LEAST.  COULD A LINGUIST, COULD A GRAMMARIAN,
COULD EVEN A MATHEMATICIAN HAVE SEEN WHAT SHE DID, HAVE WITNESSED THEIR
APPEARANCE TOGETHER, AND HEARD THEIR HISTORY OF IT, WITHOUT FEELING
THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAD BEEN AT WORK TO MAKE THEM PECULIARLY INTERESTING
TO EACH OTHER?--HOW MUCH MORE MUST AN IMAGINIST, LIKE HERSELF,
BE ON FIRE WITH SPECULATION AND FORESIGHT!--ESPECIALLY WITH SUCH
A GROUNDWORK OF ANTICIPATION AS HER MIND HAD ALREADY MADE.

IT WAS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY THING!  NOTHING OF THE SORT HAD EVER
OCCURRED BEFORE TO ANY YOUNG LADIES IN THE PLACE, WITHIN HER MEMORY;
NO RENCONTRE, NO ALARM OF THE KIND;--AND NOW IT HAD HAPPENED
TO THE VERY PERSON, AND AT THE VERY HOUR, WHEN THE OTHER VERY
PERSON WAS CHANCING TO PASS BY TO RESCUE HER!--IT CERTAINLY
WAS VERY EXTRAORDINARY!--AND KNOWING, AS SHE DID, THE FAVOURABLE
STATE OF MIND OF EACH AT THIS PERIOD, IT STRUCK HER THE MORE.
HE WAS WISHING TO GET THE BETTER OF HIS ATTACHMENT TO HERSELF,
SHE JUST RECOVERING FROM HER MANIA FOR MR. ELTON.  IT SEEMED AS IF
EVERY THING UNITED TO PROMISE THE MOST INTERESTING CONSEQUENCES.
IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THAT THE OCCURRENCE SHOULD NOT BE STRONGLY
RECOMMENDING EACH TO THE OTHER.

IN THE FEW MINUTES' CONVERSATION WHICH SHE HAD YET HAD WITH HIM,
WHILE HARRIET HAD BEEN PARTIALLY INSENSIBLE, HE HAD SPOKEN OF HER TERROR,
HER NAIVETE, HER FERVOUR AS SHE SEIZED AND CLUNG TO HIS ARM, WITH A
SENSIBILITY AMUSED AND DELIGHTED; AND JUST AT LAST, AFTER HARRIET'S
OWN ACCOUNT HAD BEEN GIVEN, HE HAD EXPRESSED HIS INDIGNATION
AT THE ABOMINABLE FOLLY OF MISS BICKERTON IN THE WARMEST TERMS.
EVERY THING WAS TO TAKE ITS NATURAL COURSE, HOWEVER, NEITHER IMPELLED
NOR ASSISTED.  SHE WOULD NOT STIR A STEP, NOR DROP A HINT.
NO, SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH OF INTERFERENCE.  THERE COULD BE NO HARM
IN A SCHEME, A MERE PASSIVE SCHEME.  IT WAS NO MORE THAN A WISH.
BEYOND IT SHE WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT PROCEED.

EMMA'S FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO KEEP HER FATHER FROM THE KNOWLEDGE
OF WHAT HAD PASSED,--AWARE OF THE ANXIETY AND ALARM IT WOULD OCCASION:
BUT SHE SOON FELT THAT CONCEALMENT MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE.  WITHIN HALF
AN HOUR IT WAS KNOWN ALL OVER HIGHBURY.  IT WAS THE VERY EVENT
TO ENGAGE THOSE WHO TALK MOST, THE YOUNG AND THE LOW; AND ALL
THE YOUTH AND SERVANTS IN THE PLACE WERE SOON IN THE HAPPINESS OF
FRIGHTFUL NEWS.  THE LAST NIGHT'S BALL SEEMED LOST IN THE GIPSIES.
POOR MR. WOODHOUSE TREMBLED AS HE SAT, AND, AS EMMA HAD FORESEEN,
WOULD SCARCELY BE SATISFIED WITHOUT THEIR PROMISING NEVER TO GO
BEYOND THE SHRUBBERY AGAIN.  IT WAS SOME COMFORT TO HIM THAT MANY
INQUIRIES AFTER HIMSELF AND MISS WOODHOUSE (FOR HIS NEIGHBOURS
KNEW THAT HE LOVED TO BE INQUIRED AFTER), AS WELL AS MISS SMITH,
WERE COMING IN DURING THE REST OF THE DAY; AND HE HAD THE PLEASURE
OF RETURNING FOR ANSWER, THAT THEY WERE ALL VERY INDIFFERENT--
WHICH, THOUGH NOT EXACTLY TRUE, FOR SHE WAS PERFECTLY WELL,
AND HARRIET NOT MUCH OTHERWISE, EMMA WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH.
SHE HAD AN UNHAPPY STATE OF HEALTH IN GENERAL FOR THE CHILD OF SUCH
A MAN, FOR SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT INDISPOSITION WAS; AND IF HE DID NOT
INVENT ILLNESSES FOR HER, SHE COULD MAKE NO FIGURE IN A MESSAGE.

THE GIPSIES DID NOT WAIT FOR THE OPERATIONS OF JUSTICE; THEY TOOK
THEMSELVES OFF IN A HURRY.  THE YOUNG LADIES OF HIGHBURY MIGHT HAVE
WALKED AGAIN IN SAFETY BEFORE THEIR PANIC BEGAN, AND THE WHOLE
HISTORY DWINDLED SOON INTO A MATTER OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE BUT TO EMMA
AND HER NEPHEWS:--IN HER IMAGINATION IT MAINTAINED ITS GROUND,
AND HENRY AND JOHN WERE STILL ASKING EVERY DAY FOR THE STORY OF
HARRIET AND THE GIPSIES, AND STILL TENACIOUSLY SETTING HER RIGHT
IF SHE VARIED IN THE SLIGHTEST PARTICULAR FROM THE ORIGINAL RECITAL.



CHAPTER IV


A VERY FEW DAYS HAD PASSED AFTER THIS ADVENTURE, WHEN HARRIET CAME
ONE MORNING TO EMMA WITH A SMALL PARCEL IN HER HAND, AND AFTER
SITTING DOWN AND HESITATING, THUS BEGAN:

"MISS WOODHOUSE--IF YOU ARE AT LEISURE--I HAVE SOMETHING THAT I
SHOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU--A SORT OF CONFESSION TO MAKE--AND THEN,
YOU KNOW, IT WILL BE OVER."

EMMA WAS A GOOD DEAL SURPRIZED; BUT BEGGED HER TO SPEAK.
THERE WAS A SERIOUSNESS IN HARRIET'S MANNER WHICH PREPARED HER,
QUITE AS MUCH AS HER WORDS, FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN ORDINARY.

"IT IS MY DUTY, AND I AM SURE IT IS MY WISH," SHE CONTINUED,
"TO HAVE NO RESERVES WITH YOU ON THIS SUBJECT.  AS I AM HAPPILY
QUITE AN ALTERED CREATURE IN _ONE_ _RESPECT_, IT IS VERY FIT THAT YOU
SHOULD HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING IT.  I DO NOT WANT TO SAY
MORE THAN IS NECESSARY--I AM TOO MUCH ASHAMED OF HAVING GIVEN WAY
AS I HAVE DONE, AND I DARE SAY YOU UNDERSTAND ME."

"YES," SAID EMMA, "I HOPE I DO."

"HOW I COULD SO LONG A TIME BE FANCYING MYSELF! . . ."
CRIED HARRIET, WARMLY.  "IT SEEMS LIKE MADNESS!  I CAN SEE NOTHING
AT ALL EXTRAORDINARY IN HIM NOW.--I DO NOT CARE WHETHER I MEET
HIM OR NOT--EXCEPT THAT OF THE TWO I HAD RATHER NOT SEE HIM--
AND INDEED I WOULD GO ANY DISTANCE ROUND TO AVOID HIM--BUT I DO
NOT ENVY HIS WIFE IN THE LEAST; I NEITHER ADMIRE HER NOR ENVY HER,
AS I HAVE DONE:  SHE IS VERY CHARMING, I DARE SAY, AND ALL THAT,
BUT I THINK HER VERY ILL-TEMPERED AND DISAGREEABLE--I SHALL NEVER FORGET
HER LOOK THE OTHER NIGHT!--HOWEVER, I ASSURE YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE,
I WISH HER NO EVIL.--NO, LET THEM BE EVER SO HAPPY TOGETHER,
IT WILL NOT GIVE ME ANOTHER MOMENT'S PANG:  AND TO CONVINCE YOU
THAT I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TRUTH, I AM NOW GOING TO DESTROY--WHAT I
OUGHT TO HAVE DESTROYED LONG AGO--WHAT I OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE KEPT--
I KNOW THAT VERY WELL (BLUSHING AS SHE SPOKE).--HOWEVER, NOW I
WILL DESTROY IT ALL--AND IT IS MY PARTICULAR WISH TO DO IT
IN YOUR PRESENCE, THAT YOU MAY SEE HOW RATIONAL I AM GROWN.
CANNOT YOU GUESS WHAT THIS PARCEL HOLDS?" SAID SHE, WITH A CONSCIOUS LOOK.

"NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD.--DID HE EVER GIVE YOU ANY THING?"

"NO--I CANNOT CALL THEM GIFTS; BUT THEY ARE THINGS THAT I HAVE
VALUED VERY MUCH."

SHE HELD THE PARCEL TOWARDS HER, AND EMMA READ THE WORDS _MOST_
_PRECIOUS_ _TREASURES_ ON THE TOP.  HER CURIOSITY WAS GREATLY EXCITED.
HARRIET UNFOLDED THE PARCEL, AND SHE LOOKED ON WITH IMPATIENCE.
WITHIN ABUNDANCE OF SILVER PAPER WAS A PRETTY LITTLE TUNBRIDGE-WARE BOX,
WHICH HARRIET OPENED:  IT WAS WELL LINED WITH THE SOFTEST COTTON;
BUT, EXCEPTING THE COTTON, EMMA SAW ONLY A SMALL PIECE OF COURT-PLAISTER.

"NOW," SAID HARRIET, "YOU _MUST_ RECOLLECT."

"NO, INDEED I DO NOT."

"DEAR ME!  I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE YOU COULD FORGET
WHAT PASSED IN THIS VERY ROOM ABOUT COURT-PLAISTER, ONE OF THE VERY
LAST TIMES WE EVER MET IN IT!--IT WAS BUT A VERY FEW DAYS BEFORE I
HAD MY SORE THROAT--JUST BEFORE MR. AND MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY CAME--
I THINK THE VERY EVENING.--DO NOT YOU REMEMBER HIS CUTTING HIS FINGER
WITH YOUR NEW PENKNIFE, AND YOUR RECOMMENDING COURT-PLAISTER?--
BUT, AS YOU HAD NONE ABOUT YOU, AND KNEW I HAD, YOU DESIRED
ME TO SUPPLY HIM; AND SO I TOOK MINE OUT AND CUT HIM A PIECE;
BUT IT WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO LARGE, AND HE CUT IT SMALLER, AND KEPT
PLAYING SOME TIME WITH WHAT WAS LEFT, BEFORE HE GAVE IT BACK TO ME.
AND SO THEN, IN MY NONSENSE, I COULD NOT HELP MAKING A TREASURE OF IT--
SO I PUT IT BY NEVER TO BE USED, AND LOOKED AT IT NOW AND THEN
AS A GREAT TREAT."

"MY DEAREST HARRIET!" CRIED EMMA, PUTTING HER HAND BEFORE HER FACE,
AND JUMPING UP, "YOU MAKE ME MORE ASHAMED OF MYSELF THAN I CAN BEAR.
REMEMBER IT?  AYE, I REMEMBER IT ALL NOW; ALL, EXCEPT YOUR SAVING
THIS RELIC--I KNEW NOTHING OF THAT TILL THIS MOMENT--BUT THE CUTTING
THE FINGER, AND MY RECOMMENDING COURT-PLAISTER, AND SAYING I HAD NONE
ABOUT ME!--OH! MY SINS, MY SINS!--AND I HAD PLENTY ALL THE WHILE IN
MY POCKET!--ONE OF MY SENSELESS TRICKS!--I DESERVE TO BE UNDER A
CONTINUAL BLUSH ALL THE REST OF MY LIFE.--WELL--(SITTING DOWN AGAIN)--
GO ON--WHAT ELSE?"

"AND HAD YOU REALLY SOME AT HAND YOURSELF?  I AM SURE I NEVER
SUSPECTED IT, YOU DID IT SO NATURALLY."

"AND SO YOU ACTUALLY PUT THIS PIECE OF COURT-PLAISTER BY FOR HIS SAKE!"
SAID EMMA, RECOVERING FROM HER STATE OF SHAME AND FEELING DIVIDED
BETWEEN WONDER AND AMUSEMENT.  AND SECRETLY SHE ADDED TO HERSELF,
"LORD BLESS ME! WHEN SHOULD I EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF PUTTING BY IN COTTON
A PIECE OF COURT-PLAISTER THAT FRANK CHURCHILL HAD BEEN PULLING ABOUT!
I NEVER WAS EQUAL TO THIS."

"HERE," RESUMED HARRIET, TURNING TO HER BOX AGAIN, "HERE IS
SOMETHING STILL MORE VALUABLE, I MEAN THAT _HAS_ _BEEN_ MORE VALUABLE,
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT DID REALLY ONCE BELONG TO HIM, WHICH THE
COURT-PLAISTER NEVER DID."

EMMA WAS QUITE EAGER TO SEE THIS SUPERIOR TREASURE.  IT WAS THE END
OF AN OLD PENCIL,--THE PART WITHOUT ANY LEAD.

"THIS WAS REALLY HIS," SAID HARRIET.--"DO NOT YOU REMEMBER
ONE MORNING?--NO, I DARE SAY YOU DO NOT.  BUT ONE MORNING--I FORGET
EXACTLY THE DAY--BUT PERHAPS IT WAS THE TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY BEFORE
_THAT_ _EVENING_, HE WANTED TO MAKE A MEMORANDUM IN HIS POCKET-BOOK;
IT WAS ABOUT SPRUCE-BEER. MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD BEEN TELLING HIM
SOMETHING ABOUT BREWING SPRUCE-BEER, AND HE WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN;
BUT WHEN HE TOOK OUT HIS PENCIL, THERE WAS SO LITTLE LEAD THAT HE
SOON CUT IT ALL AWAY, AND IT WOULD NOT DO, SO YOU LENT HIM ANOTHER,
AND THIS WAS LEFT UPON THE TABLE AS GOOD FOR NOTHING.  BUT I KEPT
MY EYE ON IT; AND, AS SOON AS I DARED, CAUGHT IT UP, AND NEVER
PARTED WITH IT AGAIN FROM THAT MOMENT."

"I DO REMEMBER IT," CRIED EMMA; "I PERFECTLY REMEMBER IT.--
TALKING ABOUT SPRUCE-BEER.--OH! YES--MR. KNIGHTLEY AND I BOTH SAYING WE
LIKED IT, AND MR. ELTON'S SEEMING RESOLVED TO LEARN TO LIKE IT TOO.
I PERFECTLY REMEMBER IT.--STOP; MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS STANDING JUST HERE,
WAS NOT HE?  I HAVE AN IDEA HE WAS STANDING JUST HERE."

"AH!  I DO NOT KNOW.  I CANNOT RECOLLECT.--IT IS VERY ODD,
BUT I CANNOT RECOLLECT.--MR. ELTON WAS SITTING HERE, I REMEMBER,
MUCH ABOUT WHERE I AM NOW."--

"WELL, GO ON."

"OH! THAT'S ALL.  I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SHEW YOU, OR TO SAY--
EXCEPT THAT I AM NOW GOING TO THROW THEM BOTH BEHIND THE FIRE,
AND I WISH YOU TO SEE ME DO IT."

"MY POOR DEAR HARRIET! AND HAVE YOU ACTUALLY FOUND HAPPINESS
IN TREASURING UP THESE THINGS?"

"YES, SIMPLETON AS I WAS!--BUT I AM QUITE ASHAMED OF IT NOW, AND WISH
I COULD FORGET AS EASILY AS I CAN BURN THEM.  IT WAS VERY WRONG
OF ME, YOU KNOW, TO KEEP ANY REMEMBRANCES, AFTER HE WAS MARRIED.
I KNEW IT WAS--BUT HAD NOT RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PART WITH THEM."

"BUT, HARRIET, IS IT NECESSARY TO BURN THE COURT-PLAISTER?--I HAVE
NOT A WORD TO SAY FOR THE BIT OF OLD PENCIL, BUT THE COURT-PLAISTER
MIGHT BE USEFUL."

"I SHALL BE HAPPIER TO BURN IT," REPLIED HARRIET.  "IT HAS
A DISAGREEABLE LOOK TO ME.  I MUST GET RID OF EVERY THING.--
THERE IT GOES, AND THERE IS AN END, THANK HEAVEN! OF MR. ELTON."

"AND WHEN," THOUGHT EMMA, "WILL THERE BE A BEGINNING OF MR. CHURCHILL?"

SHE HAD SOON AFTERWARDS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE BEGINNING WAS
ALREADY MADE, AND COULD NOT BUT HOPE THAT THE GIPSY, THOUGH SHE HAD
_TOLD_ NO FORTUNE, MIGHT BE PROVED TO HAVE MADE HARRIET'S.--ABOUT A
FORTNIGHT AFTER THE ALARM, THEY CAME TO A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION,
AND QUITE UNDESIGNEDLY.  EMMA WAS NOT THINKING OF IT AT THE MOMENT,
WHICH MADE THE INFORMATION SHE RECEIVED MORE VALUABLE.
SHE MERELY SAID, IN THE COURSE OF SOME TRIVIAL CHAT, "WELL, HARRIET,
WHENEVER YOU MARRY I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO DO SO AND SO"--AND THOUGHT
NO MORE OF IT, TILL AFTER A MINUTE'S SILENCE SHE HEARD HARRIET
SAY IN A VERY SERIOUS TONE, "I SHALL NEVER MARRY."

EMMA THEN LOOKED UP, AND IMMEDIATELY SAW HOW IT WAS; AND AFTER A
MOMENT'S DEBATE, AS TO WHETHER IT SHOULD PASS UNNOTICED OR NOT, REPLIED,

"NEVER MARRY!--THIS IS A NEW RESOLUTION."

"IT IS ONE THAT I SHALL NEVER CHANGE, HOWEVER."

AFTER ANOTHER SHORT HESITATION, "I HOPE IT DOES NOT PROCEED FROM--
I HOPE IT IS NOT IN COMPLIMENT TO MR. ELTON?"

"MR. ELTON INDEED!" CRIED HARRIET INDIGNANTLY.--"OH! NO"--AND EMMA
COULD JUST CATCH THE WORDS, "SO SUPERIOR TO MR. ELTON!"

SHE THEN TOOK A LONGER TIME FOR CONSIDERATION.  SHOULD SHE PROCEED
NO FARTHER?--SHOULD SHE LET IT PASS, AND SEEM TO SUSPECT NOTHING?--
PERHAPS HARRIET MIGHT THINK HER COLD OR ANGRY IF SHE DID;
OR PERHAPS IF SHE WERE TOTALLY SILENT, IT MIGHT ONLY DRIVE
HARRIET INTO ASKING HER TO HEAR TOO MUCH; AND AGAINST ANY THING
LIKE SUCH AN UNRESERVE AS HAD BEEN, SUCH AN OPEN AND FREQUENT
DISCUSSION OF HOPES AND CHANCES, SHE WAS PERFECTLY RESOLVED.--
SHE BELIEVED IT WOULD BE WISER FOR HER TO SAY AND KNOW AT ONCE,
ALL THAT SHE MEANT TO SAY AND KNOW.  PLAIN DEALING WAS ALWAYS BEST.
SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED HOW FAR SHE WOULD PROCEED,
ON ANY APPLICATION OF THE SORT; AND IT WOULD BE SAFER FOR BOTH,
TO HAVE THE JUDICIOUS LAW OF HER OWN BRAIN LAID DOWN WITH SPEED.--
SHE WAS DECIDED, AND THUS SPOKE--

"HARRIET, I WILL NOT AFFECT TO BE IN DOUBT OF YOUR MEANING.
YOUR RESOLUTION, OR RATHER YOUR EXPECTATION OF NEVER MARRYING,
RESULTS FROM AN IDEA THAT THE PERSON WHOM YOU MIGHT PREFER,
WOULD BE TOO GREATLY YOUR SUPERIOR IN SITUATION TO THINK OF YOU.
IS NOT IT SO?"

"OH!  MISS WOODHOUSE, BELIEVE ME I HAVE NOT THE PRESUMPTION TO SUPPOSE--
INDEED I AM NOT SO MAD.--BUT IT IS A PLEASURE TO ME TO ADMIRE HIM
AT A DISTANCE--AND TO THINK OF HIS INFINITE SUPERIORITY TO ALL
THE REST OF THE WORLD, WITH THE GRATITUDE, WONDER, AND VENERATION,
WHICH ARE SO PROPER, IN ME ESPECIALLY."

"I AM NOT AT ALL SURPRIZED AT YOU, HARRIET.  THE SERVICE HE RENDERED
YOU WAS ENOUGH TO WARM YOUR HEART."

"SERVICE! OH! IT WAS SUCH AN INEXPRESSIBLE OBLIGATION!--
THE VERY RECOLLECTION OF IT, AND ALL THAT I FELT AT THE TIME--
WHEN I SAW HIM COMING--HIS NOBLE LOOK--AND MY WRETCHEDNESS BEFORE.
SUCH A CHANGE!  IN ONE MOMENT SUCH A CHANGE!  FROM PERFECT MISERY
TO PERFECT HAPPINESS!"

"IT IS VERY NATURAL.  IT IS NATURAL, AND IT IS HONOURABLE.--
YES, HONOURABLE, I THINK, TO CHUSE SO WELL AND SO GRATEFULLY.--
BUT THAT IT WILL BE A FORTUNATE PREFERENCE IS MORE THAT I CAN PROMISE.
I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO GIVE WAY TO IT, HARRIET.  I DO NOT BY ANY
MEANS ENGAGE FOR ITS BEING RETURNED.  CONSIDER WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT.
PERHAPS IT WILL BE WISEST IN YOU TO CHECK YOUR FEELINGS WHILE YOU CAN:
AT ANY RATE DO NOT LET THEM CARRY YOU FAR, UNLESS YOU ARE PERSUADED
OF HIS LIKING YOU.  BE OBSERVANT OF HIM.  LET HIS BEHAVIOUR BE THE
GUIDE OF YOUR SENSATIONS.  I GIVE YOU THIS CAUTION NOW, BECAUSE I
SHALL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN ON THE SUBJECT.  I AM DETERMINED
AGAINST ALL INTERFERENCE.  HENCEFORWARD I KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER.
LET NO NAME EVER PASS OUR LIPS.  WE WERE VERY WRONG BEFORE;
WE WILL BE CAUTIOUS NOW.--HE IS YOUR SUPERIOR, NO DOUBT, AND THERE
DO SEEM OBJECTIONS AND OBSTACLES OF A VERY SERIOUS NATURE;
BUT YET, HARRIET, MORE WONDERFUL THINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE, THERE HAVE
BEEN MATCHES OF GREATER DISPARITY.  BUT TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU TOO SANGUINE; THOUGH, HOWEVER IT MAY END,
BE ASSURED YOUR RAISING YOUR THOUGHTS TO _HIM_, IS A MARK OF GOOD TASTE
WHICH I SHALL ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO VALUE."

HARRIET KISSED HER HAND IN SILENT AND SUBMISSIVE GRATITUDE.
EMMA WAS VERY DECIDED IN THINKING SUCH AN ATTACHMENT NO BAD THING
FOR HER FRIEND.  ITS TENDENCY WOULD BE TO RAISE AND REFINE HER MIND--
AND IT MUST BE SAVING HER FROM THE DANGER OF DEGRADATION.



CHAPTER V


IN THIS STATE OF SCHEMES, AND HOPES, AND CONNIVANCE, JUNE OPENED
UPON HARTFIELD.  TO HIGHBURY IN GENERAL IT BROUGHT NO MATERIAL CHANGE.
THE ELTONS WERE STILL TALKING OF A VISIT FROM THE SUCKLINGS,
AND OF THE USE TO BE MADE OF THEIR BAROUCHE-LANDAU; AND JANE FAIRFAX
WAS STILL AT HER GRANDMOTHER'S; AND AS THE RETURN OF THE CAMPBELLS
FROM IRELAND WAS AGAIN DELAYED, AND AUGUST, INSTEAD OF MIDSUMMER,
FIXED FOR IT, SHE WAS LIKELY TO REMAIN THERE FULL TWO MONTHS LONGER,
PROVIDED AT LEAST SHE WERE ABLE TO DEFEAT MRS. ELTON'S ACTIVITY
IN HER SERVICE, AND SAVE HERSELF FROM BEING HURRIED INTO A DELIGHTFUL
SITUATION AGAINST HER WILL.

MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHO, FOR SOME REASON BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF, HAD CERTAINLY
TAKEN AN EARLY DISLIKE TO FRANK CHURCHILL, WAS ONLY GROWING TO DISLIKE
HIM MORE.  HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT HIM OF SOME DOUBLE DEALING IN HIS
PURSUIT OF EMMA.  THAT EMMA WAS HIS OBJECT APPEARED INDISPUTABLE.
EVERY THING DECLARED IT; HIS OWN ATTENTIONS, HIS FATHER'S HINTS,
HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW'S GUARDED SILENCE; IT WAS ALL IN UNISON;
WORDS, CONDUCT, DISCRETION, AND INDISCRETION, TOLD THE SAME STORY.
BUT WHILE SO MANY WERE DEVOTING HIM TO EMMA, AND EMMA HERSELF MAKING HIM
OVER TO HARRIET, MR. KNIGHTLEY BEGAN TO SUSPECT HIM OF SOME INCLINATION
TO TRIFLE WITH JANE FAIRFAX.  HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT; BUT THERE
WERE SYMPTOMS OF INTELLIGENCE BETWEEN THEM--HE THOUGHT SO AT LEAST--
SYMPTOMS OF ADMIRATION ON HIS SIDE, WHICH, HAVING ONCE OBSERVED,
HE COULD NOT PERSUADE HIMSELF TO THINK ENTIRELY VOID OF MEANING,
HOWEVER HE MIGHT WISH TO ESCAPE ANY OF EMMA'S ERRORS OF IMAGINATION.
_SHE_ WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN THE SUSPICION FIRST AROSE.  HE WAS DINING
WITH THE RANDALLS FAMILY, AND JANE, AT THE ELTONS'; AND HE HAD
SEEN A LOOK, MORE THAN A SINGLE LOOK, AT MISS FAIRFAX, WHICH,
FROM THE ADMIRER OF MISS WOODHOUSE, SEEMED SOMEWHAT OUT OF PLACE.
WHEN HE WAS AGAIN IN THEIR COMPANY, HE COULD NOT HELP REMEMBERING
WHAT HE HAD SEEN; NOR COULD HE AVOID OBSERVATIONS WHICH, UNLESS IT
WERE LIKE COWPER AND HIS FIRE AT TWILIGHT,

"MYSELF CREATING WHAT I SAW,"

BROUGHT HIM YET STRONGER SUSPICION OF THERE BEING A SOMETHING
OF PRIVATE LIKING, OF PRIVATE UNDERSTANDING EVEN, BETWEEN FRANK
CHURCHILL AND JANE.

HE HAD WALKED UP ONE DAY AFTER DINNER, AS HE VERY OFTEN DID,
TO SPEND HIS EVENING AT HARTFIELD.  EMMA AND HARRIET WERE GOING
TO WALK; HE JOINED THEM; AND, ON RETURNING, THEY FELL IN WITH A
LARGER PARTY, WHO, LIKE THEMSELVES, JUDGED IT WISEST TO TAKE THEIR
EXERCISE EARLY, AS THE WEATHER THREATENED RAIN; MR. AND MRS. WESTON
AND THEIR SON, MISS BATES AND HER NIECE, WHO HAD ACCIDENTALLY MET.
THEY ALL UNITED; AND, ON REACHING HARTFIELD GATES, EMMA, WHO KNEW IT
WAS EXACTLY THE SORT OF VISITING THAT WOULD BE WELCOME TO HER FATHER,
PRESSED THEM ALL TO GO IN AND DRINK TEA WITH HIM.  THE RANDALLS
PARTY AGREED TO IT IMMEDIATELY; AND AFTER A PRETTY LONG SPEECH
FROM MISS BATES, WHICH FEW PERSONS LISTENED TO, SHE ALSO FOUND IT
POSSIBLE TO ACCEPT DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE'S MOST OBLIGING INVITATION.

AS THEY WERE TURNING INTO THE GROUNDS, MR. PERRY PASSED BY ON HORSEBACK.
THE GENTLEMEN SPOKE OF HIS HORSE.

"BY THE BYE," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL TO MRS. WESTON PRESENTLY,
"WHAT BECAME OF MR. PERRY'S PLAN OF SETTING UP HIS CARRIAGE?"

MRS. WESTON LOOKED SURPRIZED, AND SAID, "I DID NOT KNOW THAT HE
EVER HAD ANY SUCH PLAN."

"NAY, I HAD IT FROM YOU.  YOU WROTE ME WORD OF IT THREE MONTHS AGO."

"ME! IMPOSSIBLE!"

"INDEED YOU DID.  I REMEMBER IT PERFECTLY.  YOU MENTIONED IT AS
WHAT WAS CERTAINLY TO BE VERY SOON.  MRS. PERRY HAD TOLD SOMEBODY,
AND WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY ABOUT IT.  IT WAS OWING TO _HER_ PERSUASION,
AS SHE THOUGHT HIS BEING OUT IN BAD WEATHER DID HIM A GREAT DEAL
OF HARM.  YOU MUST REMEMBER IT NOW?"

"UPON MY WORD I NEVER HEARD OF IT TILL THIS MOMENT."

"NEVER! REALLY, NEVER!--BLESS ME! HOW COULD IT BE?--THEN I MUST
HAVE DREAMT IT--BUT I WAS COMPLETELY PERSUADED--MISS SMITH,
YOU WALK AS IF YOU WERE TIRED.  YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY TO FIND
YOURSELF AT HOME."

"WHAT IS THIS?--WHAT IS THIS?" CRIED MR. WESTON, "ABOUT PERRY
AND A CARRIAGE?  IS PERRY GOING TO SET UP HIS CARRIAGE, FRANK?
I AM GLAD HE CAN AFFORD IT.  YOU HAD IT FROM HIMSELF, HAD YOU?"

"NO, SIR," REPLIED HIS SON, LAUGHING, "I SEEM TO HAVE HAD IT
FROM NOBODY.--VERY ODD!--I REALLY WAS PERSUADED OF MRS. WESTON'S
HAVING MENTIONED IT IN ONE OF HER LETTERS TO ENSCOMBE, MANY WEEKS AGO,
WITH ALL THESE PARTICULARS--BUT AS SHE DECLARES SHE NEVER HEARD
A SYLLABLE OF IT BEFORE, OF COURSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN A DREAM.  I AM
A GREAT DREAMER.  I DREAM OF EVERY BODY AT HIGHBURY WHEN I AM AWAY--
AND WHEN I HAVE GONE THROUGH MY PARTICULAR FRIENDS, THEN I BEGIN
DREAMING OF MR. AND MRS. PERRY."

"IT IS ODD THOUGH," OBSERVED HIS FATHER, "THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD SUCH
A REGULAR CONNECTED DREAM ABOUT PEOPLE WHOM IT WAS NOT VERY LIKELY YOU
SHOULD BE THINKING OF AT ENSCOMBE.  PERRY'S SETTING UP HIS CARRIAGE!
AND HIS WIFE'S PERSUADING HIM TO IT, OUT OF CARE FOR HIS HEALTH--
JUST WHAT WILL HAPPEN, I HAVE NO DOUBT, SOME TIME OR OTHER;
ONLY A LITTLE PREMATURE.  WHAT AN AIR OF PROBABILITY SOMETIMES
RUNS THROUGH A DREAM!  AND AT OTHERS, WHAT A HEAP OF ABSURDITIES
IT IS!  WELL, FRANK, YOUR DREAM CERTAINLY SHEWS THAT HIGHBURY IS IN
YOUR THOUGHTS WHEN YOU ARE ABSENT.  EMMA, YOU ARE A GREAT DREAMER,
I THINK?"

EMMA WAS OUT OF HEARING.  SHE HAD HURRIED ON BEFORE HER GUESTS
TO PREPARE HER FATHER FOR THEIR APPEARANCE, AND WAS BEYOND THE REACH
OF MR. WESTON'S HINT.

"WHY, TO OWN THE TRUTH," CRIED MISS BATES, WHO HAD BEEN TRYING IN VAIN
TO BE HEARD THE LAST TWO MINUTES, "IF I MUST SPEAK ON THIS SUBJECT,
THERE IS NO DENYING THAT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL MIGHT HAVE--I DO NOT
MEAN TO SAY THAT HE DID NOT DREAM IT--I AM SURE I HAVE SOMETIMES
THE ODDEST DREAMS IN THE WORLD--BUT IF I AM QUESTIONED ABOUT IT,
I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS SUCH AN IDEA LAST SPRING;
FOR MRS. PERRY HERSELF MENTIONED IT TO MY MOTHER, AND THE COLES
KNEW OF IT AS WELL AS OURSELVES--BUT IT WAS QUITE A SECRET,
KNOWN TO NOBODY ELSE, AND ONLY THOUGHT OF ABOUT THREE DAYS.
MRS. PERRY WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A CARRIAGE, AND CAME
TO MY MOTHER IN GREAT SPIRITS ONE MORNING BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT SHE
HAD PREVAILED.  JANE, DON'T YOU REMEMBER GRANDMAMA'S TELLING US
OF IT WHEN WE GOT HOME?  I FORGET WHERE WE HAD BEEN WALKING TO--
VERY LIKELY TO RANDALLS; YES, I THINK IT WAS TO RANDALLS.
MRS. PERRY WAS ALWAYS PARTICULARLY FOND OF MY MOTHER--INDEED I DO
NOT KNOW WHO IS NOT--AND SHE HAD MENTIONED IT TO HER IN CONFIDENCE;
SHE HAD NO OBJECTION TO HER TELLING US, OF COURSE, BUT IT WAS NOT
TO GO BEYOND:  AND, FROM THAT DAY TO THIS, I NEVER MENTIONED IT
TO A SOUL THAT I KNOW OF.  AT THE SAME TIME, I WILL NOT POSITIVELY
ANSWER FOR MY HAVING NEVER DROPT A HINT, BECAUSE I KNOW I DO
SOMETIMES POP OUT A THING BEFORE I AM AWARE.  I AM A TALKER,
YOU KNOW; I AM RATHER A TALKER; AND NOW AND THEN I HAVE LET A THING
ESCAPE ME WHICH I SHOULD NOT.  I AM NOT LIKE JANE; I WISH I WERE.
I WILL ANSWER FOR IT _SHE_ NEVER BETRAYED THE LEAST THING IN THE WORLD.
WHERE IS SHE?--OH! JUST BEHIND.  PERFECTLY REMEMBER MRS. PERRY'S COMING.--
EXTRAORDINARY DREAM, INDEED!"

THEY WERE ENTERING THE HALL.  MR. KNIGHTLEY'S EYES HAD PRECEDED
MISS BATES'S IN A GLANCE AT JANE.  FROM FRANK CHURCHILL'S FACE,
WHERE HE THOUGHT HE SAW CONFUSION SUPPRESSED OR LAUGHED AWAY,
HE HAD INVOLUNTARILY TURNED TO HERS; BUT SHE WAS INDEED BEHIND,
AND TOO BUSY WITH HER SHAWL.  MR. WESTON HAD WALKED IN.  THE TWO
OTHER GENTLEMEN WAITED AT THE DOOR TO LET HER PASS.  MR. KNIGHTLEY
SUSPECTED IN FRANK CHURCHILL THE DETERMINATION OF CATCHING HER EYE--
HE SEEMED WATCHING HER INTENTLY--IN VAIN, HOWEVER, IF IT WERE SO--
JANE PASSED BETWEEN THEM INTO THE HALL, AND LOOKED AT NEITHER.

THERE WAS NO TIME FOR FARTHER REMARK OR EXPLANATION.  THE DREAM MUST
BE BORNE WITH, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY MUST TAKE HIS SEAT WITH THE REST ROUND
THE LARGE MODERN CIRCULAR TABLE WHICH EMMA HAD INTRODUCED AT HARTFIELD,
AND WHICH NONE BUT EMMA COULD HAVE HAD POWER TO PLACE THERE AND
PERSUADE HER FATHER TO USE, INSTEAD OF THE SMALL-SIZED PEMBROKE,
ON WHICH TWO OF HIS DAILY MEALS HAD, FOR FORTY YEARS BEEN CROWDED.
TEA PASSED PLEASANTLY, AND NOBODY SEEMED IN A HURRY TO MOVE.

"MISS WOODHOUSE," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, AFTER EXAMINING A TABLE
BEHIND HIM, WHICH HE COULD REACH AS HE SAT, "HAVE YOUR NEPHEWS TAKEN
AWAY THEIR ALPHABETS--THEIR BOX OF LETTERS?  IT USED TO STAND HERE.
WHERE IS IT?  THIS IS A SORT OF DULL-LOOKING EVENING, THAT OUGHT
TO BE TREATED RATHER AS WINTER THAN SUMMER.  WE HAD GREAT AMUSEMENT
WITH THOSE LETTERS ONE MORNING.  I WANT TO PUZZLE YOU AGAIN."

EMMA WAS PLEASED WITH THE THOUGHT; AND PRODUCING THE BOX, THE TABLE
WAS QUICKLY SCATTERED OVER WITH ALPHABETS, WHICH NO ONE SEEMED SO MUCH
DISPOSED TO EMPLOY AS THEIR TWO SELVES.  THEY WERE RAPIDLY FORMING
WORDS FOR EACH OTHER, OR FOR ANY BODY ELSE WHO WOULD BE PUZZLED.
THE QUIETNESS OF THE GAME MADE IT PARTICULARLY ELIGIBLE FOR
MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO HAD OFTEN BEEN DISTRESSED BY THE MORE ANIMATED SORT,
WHICH MR. WESTON HAD OCCASIONALLY INTRODUCED, AND WHO NOW SAT HAPPILY
OCCUPIED IN LAMENTING, WITH TENDER MELANCHOLY, OVER THE DEPARTURE
OF THE "POOR LITTLE BOYS," OR IN FONDLY POINTING OUT, AS HE TOOK
UP ANY STRAY LETTER NEAR HIM, HOW BEAUTIFULLY EMMA HAD WRITTEN IT.

FRANK CHURCHILL PLACED A WORD BEFORE MISS FAIRFAX.  SHE GAVE
A SLIGHT GLANCE ROUND THE TABLE, AND APPLIED HERSELF TO IT.
FRANK WAS NEXT TO EMMA, JANE OPPOSITE TO THEM--AND MR. KNIGHTLEY
SO PLACED AS TO SEE THEM ALL; AND IT WAS HIS OBJECT TO SEE AS MUCH
AS HE COULD, WITH AS LITTLE APPARENT OBSERVATION.  THE WORD
WAS DISCOVERED, AND WITH A FAINT SMILE PUSHED AWAY.  IF MEANT
TO BE IMMEDIATELY MIXED WITH THE OTHERS, AND BURIED FROM SIGHT,
SHE SHOULD HAVE LOOKED ON THE TABLE INSTEAD OF LOOKING JUST ACROSS,
FOR IT WAS NOT MIXED; AND HARRIET, EAGER AFTER EVERY FRESH WORD,
AND FINDING OUT NONE, DIRECTLY TOOK IT UP, AND FELL TO WORK.
SHE WAS SITTING BY MR. KNIGHTLEY, AND TURNED TO HIM FOR HELP.
THE WORD WAS _BLUNDER_; AND AS HARRIET EXULTINGLY PROCLAIMED IT,
THERE WAS A BLUSH ON JANE'S CHEEK WHICH GAVE IT A MEANING NOT
OTHERWISE OSTENSIBLE.  MR. KNIGHTLEY CONNECTED IT WITH THE DREAM;
BUT HOW IT COULD ALL BE, WAS BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION.
HOW THE DELICACY, THE DISCRETION OF HIS FAVOURITE COULD HAVE BEEN
SO LAIN ASLEEP!  HE FEARED THERE MUST BE SOME DECIDED INVOLVEMENT.
DISINGENUOUSNESS AND DOUBLE DEALING SEEMED TO MEET HIM AT EVERY TURN.
THESE LETTERS WERE BUT THE VEHICLE FOR GALLANTRY AND TRICK.
IT WAS A CHILD'S PLAY, CHOSEN TO CONCEAL A DEEPER GAME ON FRANK
CHURCHILL'S PART.

WITH GREAT INDIGNATION DID HE CONTINUE TO OBSERVE HIM; WITH GREAT
ALARM AND DISTRUST, TO OBSERVE ALSO HIS TWO BLINDED COMPANIONS.
HE SAW A SHORT WORD PREPARED FOR EMMA, AND GIVEN TO HER WITH A LOOK
SLY AND DEMURE.  HE SAW THAT EMMA HAD SOON MADE IT OUT, AND FOUND
IT HIGHLY ENTERTAINING, THOUGH IT WAS SOMETHING WHICH SHE JUDGED IT
PROPER TO APPEAR TO CENSURE; FOR SHE SAID, "NONSENSE! FOR SHAME!"
HE HEARD FRANK CHURCHILL NEXT SAY, WITH A GLANCE TOWARDS JANE,
"I WILL GIVE IT TO HER--SHALL I?"--AND AS CLEARLY HEARD EMMA
OPPOSING IT WITH EAGER LAUGHING WARMTH.  "NO, NO, YOU MUST NOT;
YOU SHALL NOT, INDEED."

IT WAS DONE HOWEVER.  THIS GALLANT YOUNG MAN, WHO SEEMED TO LOVE
WITHOUT FEELING, AND TO RECOMMEND HIMSELF WITHOUT COMPLAISANCE,
DIRECTLY HANDED OVER THE WORD TO MISS FAIRFAX, AND WITH A PARTICULAR
DEGREE OF SEDATE CIVILITY ENTREATED HER TO STUDY IT.  MR. KNIGHTLEY'S
EXCESSIVE CURIOSITY TO KNOW WHAT THIS WORD MIGHT BE, MADE HIM SEIZE
EVERY POSSIBLE MOMENT FOR DARTING HIS EYE TOWARDS IT, AND IT WAS
NOT LONG BEFORE HE SAW IT TO BE _DIXON_.  JANE FAIRFAX'S PERCEPTION
SEEMED TO ACCOMPANY HIS; HER COMPREHENSION WAS CERTAINLY MORE EQUAL
TO THE COVERT MEANING, THE SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE, OF THOSE FIVE LETTERS
SO ARRANGED.  SHE WAS EVIDENTLY DISPLEASED; LOOKED UP, AND SEEING
HERSELF WATCHED, BLUSHED MORE DEEPLY THAN HE HAD EVER PERCEIVED HER,
AND SAYING ONLY, "I DID NOT KNOW THAT PROPER NAMES WERE ALLOWED,"
PUSHED AWAY THE LETTERS WITH EVEN AN ANGRY SPIRIT, AND LOOKED
RESOLVED TO BE ENGAGED BY NO OTHER WORD THAT COULD BE OFFERED.
HER FACE WAS AVERTED FROM THOSE WHO HAD MADE THE ATTACK, AND TURNED
TOWARDS HER AUNT.

"AYE, VERY TRUE, MY DEAR," CRIED THE LATTER, THOUGH JANE HAD NOT
SPOKEN A WORD--"I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING.  IT IS TIME
FOR US TO BE GOING INDEED.  THE EVENING IS CLOSING IN, AND GRANDMAMA
WILL BE LOOKING FOR US.  MY DEAR SIR, YOU ARE TOO OBLIGING.
WE REALLY MUST WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT."

JANE'S ALERTNESS IN MOVING, PROVED HER AS READY AS HER AUNT
HAD PRECONCEIVED.  SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY UP, AND WANTING TO QUIT
THE TABLE; BUT SO MANY WERE ALSO MOVING, THAT SHE COULD NOT GET AWAY;
AND MR. KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HE SAW ANOTHER COLLECTION OF LETTERS ANXIOUSLY
PUSHED TOWARDS HER, AND RESOLUTELY SWEPT AWAY BY HER UNEXAMINED.
SHE WAS AFTERWARDS LOOKING FOR HER SHAWL--FRANK CHURCHILL WAS
LOOKING ALSO--IT WAS GROWING DUSK, AND THE ROOM WAS IN CONFUSION;
AND HOW THEY PARTED, MR. KNIGHTLEY COULD NOT TELL.

HE REMAINED AT HARTFIELD AFTER ALL THE REST, HIS THOUGHTS FULL
OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN; SO FULL, THAT WHEN THE CANDLES CAME TO ASSIST
HIS OBSERVATIONS, HE MUST--YES, HE CERTAINLY MUST, AS A FRIEND--
AN ANXIOUS FRIEND--GIVE EMMA SOME HINT, ASK HER SOME QUESTION.
HE COULD NOT SEE HER IN A SITUATION OF SUCH DANGER, WITHOUT TRYING TO
PRESERVE HER.  IT WAS HIS DUTY.

"PRAY, EMMA," SAID HE, "MAY I ASK IN WHAT LAY THE GREAT AMUSEMENT,
THE POIGNANT STING OF THE LAST WORD GIVEN TO YOU AND MISS FAIRFAX?
I SAW THE WORD, AND AM CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW IT COULD BE SO VERY
ENTERTAINING TO THE ONE, AND SO VERY DISTRESSING TO THE OTHER."

EMMA WAS EXTREMELY CONFUSED.  SHE COULD NOT ENDURE TO GIVE HIM THE
TRUE EXPLANATION; FOR THOUGH HER SUSPICIONS WERE BY NO MEANS REMOVED,
SHE WAS REALLY ASHAMED OF HAVING EVER IMPARTED THEM.

"OH!" SHE CRIED IN EVIDENT EMBARRASSMENT, "IT ALL MEANT NOTHING;
A MERE JOKE AMONG OURSELVES."

"THE JOKE," HE REPLIED GRAVELY, "SEEMED CONFINED TO YOU
AND MR. CHURCHILL."

HE HAD HOPED SHE WOULD SPEAK AGAIN, BUT SHE DID NOT.  SHE WOULD
RATHER BUSY HERSELF ABOUT ANY THING THAN SPEAK.  HE SAT A LITTLE
WHILE IN DOUBT.  A VARIETY OF EVILS CROSSED HIS MIND.  INTERFERENCE--
FRUITLESS INTERFERENCE.  EMMA'S CONFUSION, AND THE ACKNOWLEDGED INTIMACY,
SEEMED TO DECLARE HER AFFECTION ENGAGED.  YET HE WOULD SPEAK.
HE OWED IT TO HER, TO RISK ANY THING THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN
AN UNWELCOME INTERFERENCE, RATHER THAN HER WELFARE; TO ENCOUNTER
ANY THING, RATHER THAN THE REMEMBRANCE OF NEGLECT IN SUCH A CAUSE.

"MY DEAR EMMA," SAID HE AT LAST, WITH EARNEST KINDNESS, "DO YOU
THINK YOU PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE OF ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN
THE GENTLEMAN AND LADY WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF?"

"BETWEEN MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS FAIRFAX?  OH! YES, PERFECTLY.--
WHY DO YOU MAKE A DOUBT OF IT?"

"HAVE YOU NEVER AT ANY TIME HAD REASON TO THINK THAT HE ADMIRED HER,
OR THAT SHE ADMIRED HIM?"

"NEVER, NEVER!" SHE CRIED WITH A MOST OPEN EAGERNESS--"NEVER, FOR
THE TWENTIETH PART OF A MOMENT, DID SUCH AN IDEA OCCUR TO ME.
AND HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY COME INTO YOUR HEAD?"

"I HAVE LATELY IMAGINED THAT I SAW SYMPTOMS OF ATTACHMENT BETWEEN THEM--
CERTAIN EXPRESSIVE LOOKS, WHICH I DID NOT BELIEVE MEANT TO BE PUBLIC."

"OH! YOU AMUSE ME EXCESSIVELY.  I AM DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT YOU
CAN VOUCHSAFE TO LET YOUR IMAGINATION WANDER--BUT IT WILL NOT DO--
VERY SORRY TO CHECK YOU IN YOUR FIRST ESSAY--BUT INDEED IT WILL
NOT DO.  THERE IS NO ADMIRATION BETWEEN THEM, I DO ASSURE YOU;
AND THE APPEARANCES WHICH HAVE CAUGHT YOU, HAVE ARISEN FROM SOME
PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES--FEELINGS RATHER OF A TOTALLY DIFFERENT NATURE--
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE EXACTLY TO EXPLAIN:--THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF
NONSENSE IN IT--BUT THE PART WHICH IS CAPABLE OF BEING COMMUNICATED,
WHICH IS SENSE, IS, THAT THEY ARE AS FAR FROM ANY ATTACHMENT OR
ADMIRATION FOR ONE ANOTHER, AS ANY TWO BEINGS IN THE WORLD CAN BE.
THAT IS, I _PRESUME_ IT TO BE SO ON HER SIDE, AND I CAN _ANSWER_ FOR ITS
BEING SO ON HIS.  I WILL ANSWER FOR THE GENTLEMAN'S INDIFFERENCE."

SHE SPOKE WITH A CONFIDENCE WHICH STAGGERED, WITH A SATISFACTION
WHICH SILENCED, MR. KNIGHTLEY.  SHE WAS IN GAY SPIRITS, AND WOULD
HAVE PROLONGED THE CONVERSATION, WANTING TO HEAR THE PARTICULARS
OF HIS SUSPICIONS, EVERY LOOK DESCRIBED, AND ALL THE WHERES AND HOWS
OF A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HIGHLY ENTERTAINED HER:  BUT HIS GAIETY DID
NOT MEET HERS.  HE FOUND HE COULD NOT BE USEFUL, AND HIS FEELINGS
WERE TOO MUCH IRRITATED FOR TALKING.  THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE IRRITATED
INTO AN ABSOLUTE FEVER, BY THE FIRE WHICH MR. WOODHOUSE'S TENDER
HABITS REQUIRED ALMOST EVERY EVENING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, HE SOON
AFTERWARDS TOOK A HASTY LEAVE, AND WALKED HOME TO THE COOLNESS
AND SOLITUDE OF DONWELL ABBEY.



CHAPTER VI


AFTER BEING LONG FED WITH HOPES OF A SPEEDY VISIT FROM MR. AND
MRS. SUCKLING, THE HIGHBURY WORLD WERE OBLIGED TO ENDURE THE MORTIFICATION
OF HEARING THAT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY COME TILL THE AUTUMN.
NO SUCH IMPORTATION OF NOVELTIES COULD ENRICH THEIR INTELLECTUAL STORES
AT PRESENT.  IN THE DAILY INTERCHANGE OF NEWS, THEY MUST BE AGAIN
RESTRICTED TO THE OTHER TOPICS WITH WHICH FOR A WHILE THE SUCKLINGS'
COMING HAD BEEN UNITED, SUCH AS THE LAST ACCOUNTS OF MRS. CHURCHILL,
WHOSE HEALTH SEEMED EVERY DAY TO SUPPLY A DIFFERENT REPORT,
AND THE SITUATION OF MRS. WESTON, WHOSE HAPPINESS IT WAS TO BE HOPED
MIGHT EVENTUALLY BE AS MUCH INCREASED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A CHILD,
AS THAT OF ALL HER NEIGHBOURS WAS BY THE APPROACH OF IT.

MRS. ELTON WAS VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED.  IT WAS THE DELAY OF A GREAT
DEAL OF PLEASURE AND PARADE.  HER INTRODUCTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
MUST ALL WAIT, AND EVERY PROJECTED PARTY BE STILL ONLY TALKED OF.
SO SHE THOUGHT AT FIRST;--BUT A LITTLE CONSIDERATION CONVINCED
HER THAT EVERY THING NEED NOT BE PUT OFF.  WHY SHOULD NOT THEY
EXPLORE TO BOX HILL THOUGH THE SUCKLINGS DID NOT COME?  THEY COULD
GO THERE AGAIN WITH THEM IN THE AUTUMN.  IT WAS SETTLED THAT THEY
SHOULD GO TO BOX HILL.  THAT THERE WAS TO BE SUCH A PARTY HAD BEEN
LONG GENERALLY KNOWN:  IT HAD EVEN GIVEN THE IDEA OF ANOTHER.
EMMA HAD NEVER BEEN TO BOX HILL; SHE WISHED TO SEE WHAT EVERY BODY
FOUND SO WELL WORTH SEEING, AND SHE AND MR. WESTON HAD AGREED
TO CHUSE SOME FINE MORNING AND DRIVE THITHER.  TWO OR THREE MORE
OF THE CHOSEN ONLY WERE TO BE ADMITTED TO JOIN THEM, AND IT WAS TO
BE DONE IN A QUIET, UNPRETENDING, ELEGANT WAY, INFINITELY SUPERIOR
TO THE BUSTLE AND PREPARATION, THE REGULAR EATING AND DRINKING,
AND PICNIC PARADE OF THE ELTONS AND THE SUCKLINGS.

THIS WAS SO VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN THEM, THAT EMMA COULD
NOT BUT FEEL SOME SURPRISE, AND A LITTLE DISPLEASURE, ON HEARING
FROM MR. WESTON THAT HE HAD BEEN PROPOSING TO MRS. ELTON, AS HER
BROTHER AND SISTER HAD FAILED HER, THAT THE TWO PARTIES SHOULD UNITE,
AND GO TOGETHER; AND THAT AS MRS. ELTON HAD VERY READILY ACCEDED
TO IT, SO IT WAS TO BE, IF SHE HAD NO OBJECTION.  NOW, AS HER
OBJECTION WAS NOTHING BUT HER VERY GREAT DISLIKE OF MRS. ELTON,
OF WHICH MR. WESTON MUST ALREADY BE PERFECTLY AWARE, IT WAS NOT WORTH
BRINGING FORWARD AGAIN:--IT COULD NOT BE DONE WITHOUT A REPROOF
TO HIM, WHICH WOULD BE GIVING PAIN TO HIS WIFE; AND SHE FOUND
HERSELF THEREFORE OBLIGED TO CONSENT TO AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH SHE
WOULD HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL TO AVOID; AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH WOULD
PROBABLY EXPOSE HER EVEN TO THE DEGRADATION OF BEING SAID TO BE OF
MRS. ELTON'S PARTY!  EVERY FEELING WAS OFFENDED; AND THE FORBEARANCE
OF HER OUTWARD SUBMISSION LEFT A HEAVY ARREAR DUE OF SECRET SEVERITY
IN HER REFLECTIONS ON THE UNMANAGEABLE GOODWILL OF MR. WESTON'S TEMPER.

"I AM GLAD YOU APPROVE OF WHAT I HAVE DONE," SAID HE VERY COMFORTABLY.
"BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD.  SUCH SCHEMES AS THESE ARE NOTHING
WITHOUT NUMBERS.  ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO LARGE A PARTY.  A LARGE PARTY
SECURES ITS OWN AMUSEMENT.  AND SHE IS A GOOD-NATURED WOMAN AFTER ALL.
ONE COULD NOT LEAVE HER OUT."

EMMA DENIED NONE OF IT ALOUD, AND AGREED TO NONE OF IT IN PRIVATE.

IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF JUNE, AND THE WEATHER FINE; AND MRS. ELTON
WAS GROWING IMPATIENT TO NAME THE DAY, AND SETTLE WITH MR. WESTON
AS TO PIGEON-PIES AND COLD LAMB, WHEN A LAME CARRIAGE-HORSE THREW
EVERY THING INTO SAD UNCERTAINTY.  IT MIGHT BE WEEKS, IT MIGHT BE
ONLY A FEW DAYS, BEFORE THE HORSE WERE USEABLE; BUT NO PREPARATIONS
COULD BE VENTURED ON, AND IT WAS ALL MELANCHOLY STAGNATION.
MRS. ELTON'S RESOURCES WERE INADEQUATE TO SUCH AN ATTACK.

"IS NOT THIS MOST VEXATIONS, KNIGHTLEY?" SHE CRIED.--"AND SUCH WEATHER
FOR EXPLORING!--THESE DELAYS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS ARE QUITE ODIOUS.
WHAT ARE WE TO DO?--THE YEAR WILL WEAR AWAY AT THIS RATE,
AND NOTHING DONE.  BEFORE THIS TIME LAST YEAR I ASSURE YOU WE HAD
HAD A DELIGHTFUL EXPLORING PARTY FROM MAPLE GROVE TO KINGS WESTON."

"YOU HAD BETTER EXPLORE TO DONWELL," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY.
"THAT MAY BE DONE WITHOUT HORSES.  COME, AND EAT MY STRAWBERRIES.
THEY ARE RIPENING FAST."

IF MR. KNIGHTLEY DID NOT BEGIN SERIOUSLY, HE WAS OBLIGED TO PROCEED SO,
FOR HIS PROPOSAL WAS CAUGHT AT WITH DELIGHT; AND THE "OH!  I SHOULD
LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS," WAS NOT PLAINER IN WORDS THAN MANNER.
DONWELL WAS FAMOUS FOR ITS STRAWBERRY-BEDS, WHICH SEEMED A PLEA FOR
THE INVITATION:  BUT NO PLEA WAS NECESSARY; CABBAGE-BEDS WOULD HAVE
BEEN ENOUGH TO TEMPT THE LADY, WHO ONLY WANTED TO BE GOING SOMEWHERE.
SHE PROMISED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN TO COME--MUCH OFTENER THAN
HE DOUBTED--AND WAS EXTREMELY GRATIFIED BY SUCH A PROOF OF INTIMACY,
SUCH A DISTINGUISHING COMPLIMENT AS SHE CHOSE TO CONSIDER IT.

"YOU MAY DEPEND UPON ME," SAID SHE.  "I CERTAINLY WILL COME.
NAME YOUR DAY, AND I WILL COME.  YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO BRING
JANE FAIRFAX?"

"I CANNOT NAME A DAY," SAID HE, "TILL I HAVE SPOKEN TO SOME OTHERS
WHOM I WOULD WISH TO MEET YOU."

"OH! LEAVE ALL THAT TO ME.  ONLY GIVE ME A CARTE-BLANCHE.--I AM
LADY PATRONESS, YOU KNOW.  IT IS MY PARTY.  I WILL BRING FRIENDS
WITH ME."

"I HOPE YOU WILL BRING ELTON," SAID HE:  "BUT I WILL NOT TROUBLE
YOU TO GIVE ANY OTHER INVITATIONS."

"OH! NOW YOU ARE LOOKING VERY SLY.  BUT CONSIDER--YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID
OF DELEGATING POWER TO _ME_.  I AM NO YOUNG LADY ON HER PREFERMENT.
MARRIED WOMEN, YOU KNOW, MAY BE SAFELY AUTHORISED.  IT IS MY PARTY.
LEAVE IT ALL TO ME.  I WILL INVITE YOUR GUESTS."

"NO,"--HE CALMLY REPLIED,--"THERE IS BUT ONE MARRIED WOMAN IN THE WORLD
WHOM I CAN EVER ALLOW TO INVITE WHAT GUESTS SHE PLEASES TO DONWELL,
AND THAT ONE IS--"

"--MRS. WESTON, I SUPPOSE," INTERRUPTED MRS. ELTON, RATHER MORTIFIED.

"NO--MRS. KNIGHTLEY;--AND TILL SHE IS IN BEING, I WILL MANAGE
SUCH MATTERS MYSELF."

"AH! YOU ARE AN ODD CREATURE!" SHE CRIED, SATISFIED TO HAVE NO
ONE PREFERRED TO HERSELF.--"YOU ARE A HUMOURIST, AND MAY SAY WHAT
YOU LIKE.  QUITE A HUMOURIST.  WELL, I SHALL BRING JANE WITH ME--
JANE AND HER AUNT.--THE REST I LEAVE TO YOU.  I HAVE NO OBJECTIONS
AT ALL TO MEETING THE HARTFIELD FAMILY.  DON'T SCRUPLE.  I KNOW
YOU ARE ATTACHED TO THEM."

"YOU CERTAINLY WILL MEET THEM IF I CAN PREVAIL; AND I SHALL CALL
ON MISS BATES IN MY WAY HOME."

"THAT'S QUITE UNNECESSARY; I SEE JANE EVERY DAY:--BUT AS YOU LIKE.
IT IS TO BE A MORNING SCHEME, YOU KNOW, KNIGHTLEY; QUITE A SIMPLE THING.
I SHALL WEAR A LARGE BONNET, AND BRING ONE OF MY LITTLE BASKETS
HANGING ON MY ARM.  HERE,--PROBABLY THIS BASKET WITH PINK RIBBON.
NOTHING CAN BE MORE SIMPLE, YOU SEE.  AND JANE WILL HAVE SUCH ANOTHER.
THERE IS TO BE NO FORM OR PARADE--A SORT OF GIPSY PARTY.  WE ARE
TO WALK ABOUT YOUR GARDENS, AND GATHER THE STRAWBERRIES OURSELVES,
AND SIT UNDER TREES;--AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU MAY LIKE TO PROVIDE,
IT IS TO BE ALL OUT OF DOORS--A TABLE SPREAD IN THE SHADE, YOU KNOW.
EVERY THING AS NATURAL AND SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.  IS NOT THAT YOUR IDEA?"

"NOT QUITE.  MY IDEA OF THE SIMPLE AND THE NATURAL WILL BE TO HAVE
THE TABLE SPREAD IN THE DINING-ROOM. THE NATURE AND THE SIMPLICITY
OF GENTLEMEN AND LADIES, WITH THEIR SERVANTS AND FURNITURE, I THINK
IS BEST OBSERVED BY MEALS WITHIN DOORS.  WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF EATING
STRAWBERRIES IN THE GARDEN, THERE SHALL BE COLD MEAT IN THE HOUSE."

"WELL--AS YOU PLEASE; ONLY DON'T HAVE A GREAT SET OUT.  AND, BY THE BYE,
CAN I OR MY HOUSEKEEPER BE OF ANY USE TO YOU WITH OUR OPINION?--
PRAY BE SINCERE, KNIGHTLEY.  IF YOU WISH ME TO TALK TO MRS. HODGES,
OR TO INSPECT ANYTHING--"

"I HAVE NOT THE LEAST WISH FOR IT, I THANK YOU."

"WELL--BUT IF ANY DIFFICULTIES SHOULD ARISE, MY HOUSEKEEPER
IS EXTREMELY CLEVER."

"I WILL ANSWER FOR IT, THAT MINE THINKS HERSELF FULL AS CLEVER,
AND WOULD SPURN ANY BODY'S ASSISTANCE."

"I WISH WE HAD A DONKEY.  THE THING WOULD BE FOR US ALL TO COME
ON DONKEYS, JANE, MISS BATES, AND ME--AND MY CARO SPOSO WALKING BY.
I REALLY MUST TALK TO HIM ABOUT PURCHASING A DONKEY.  IN A COUNTRY
LIFE I CONCEIVE IT TO BE A SORT OF NECESSARY; FOR, LET A WOMAN HAVE
EVER SO MANY RESOURCES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE ALWAYS SHUT
UP AT HOME;--AND VERY LONG WALKS, YOU KNOW--IN SUMMER THERE IS DUST,
AND IN WINTER THERE IS DIRT."

"YOU WILL NOT FIND EITHER, BETWEEN DONWELL AND HIGHBURY.
DONWELL LANE IS NEVER DUSTY, AND NOW IT IS PERFECTLY DRY.  COME ON
A DONKEY, HOWEVER, IF YOU PREFER IT.  YOU CAN BORROW MRS. COLE'S.
I WOULD WISH EVERY THING TO BE AS MUCH TO YOUR TASTE AS POSSIBLE."

"THAT I AM SURE YOU WOULD.  INDEED I DO YOU JUSTICE, MY GOOD FRIEND.
UNDER THAT PECULIAR SORT OF DRY, BLUNT MANNER, I KNOW YOU HAVE THE
WARMEST HEART.  AS I TELL MR. E., YOU ARE A THOROUGH HUMOURIST.--
YES, BELIEVE ME, KNIGHTLEY, I AM FULLY SENSIBLE OF YOUR ATTENTION
TO ME IN THE WHOLE OF THIS SCHEME.  YOU HAVE HIT UPON THE VERY THING
TO PLEASE ME."

MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD ANOTHER REASON FOR AVOIDING A TABLE IN THE SHADE.
HE WISHED TO PERSUADE MR. WOODHOUSE, AS WELL AS EMMA, TO JOIN THE PARTY;
AND HE KNEW THAT TO HAVE ANY OF THEM SITTING DOWN OUT OF DOORS
TO EAT WOULD INEVITABLY MAKE HIM ILL.  MR. WOODHOUSE MUST NOT,
UNDER THE SPECIOUS PRETENCE OF A MORNING DRIVE, AND AN HOUR OR TWO
SPENT AT DONWELL, BE TEMPTED AWAY TO HIS MISERY.

HE WAS INVITED ON GOOD FAITH.  NO LURKING HORRORS WERE TO UPBRAID
HIM FOR HIS EASY CREDULITY.  HE DID CONSENT.  HE HAD NOT BEEN
AT DONWELL FOR TWO YEARS.  "SOME VERY FINE MORNING, HE, AND EMMA,
AND HARRIET, COULD GO VERY WELL; AND HE COULD SIT STILL WITH
MRS. WESTON, WHILE THE DEAR GIRLS WALKED ABOUT THE GARDENS.
HE DID NOT SUPPOSE THEY COULD BE DAMP NOW, IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE DAY.  HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OLD HOUSE AGAIN EXCEEDINGLY,
AND SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO MEET MR. AND MRS. ELTON, AND ANY OTHER
OF HIS NEIGHBOURS.--HE COULD NOT SEE ANY OBJECTION AT ALL TO HIS,
AND EMMA'S, AND HARRIET'S GOING THERE SOME VERY FINE MORNING.
HE THOUGHT IT VERY WELL DONE OF MR. KNIGHTLEY TO INVITE THEM--
VERY KIND AND SENSIBLE--MUCH CLEVERER THAN DINING OUT.--HE WAS NOT
FOND OF DINING OUT."

MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS FORTUNATE IN EVERY BODY'S MOST READY CONCURRENCE.
THE INVITATION WAS EVERYWHERE SO WELL RECEIVED, THAT IT SEEMED AS IF,
LIKE MRS. ELTON, THEY WERE ALL TAKING THE SCHEME AS A PARTICULAR
COMPLIMENT TO THEMSELVES.--EMMA AND HARRIET PROFESSED VERY HIGH
EXPECTATIONS OF PLEASURE FROM IT; AND MR. WESTON, UNASKED,
PROMISED TO GET FRANK OVER TO JOIN THEM, IF POSSIBLE; A PROOF
OF APPROBATION AND GRATITUDE WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DISPENSED WITH.--
MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS THEN OBLIGED TO SAY THAT HE SHOULD BE GLAD
TO SEE HIM; AND MR. WESTON ENGAGED TO LOSE NO TIME IN WRITING,
AND SPARE NO ARGUMENTS TO INDUCE HIM TO COME.

IN THE MEANWHILE THE LAME HORSE RECOVERED SO FAST, THAT THE PARTY
TO BOX HILL WAS AGAIN UNDER HAPPY CONSIDERATION; AND AT LAST DONWELL
WAS SETTLED FOR ONE DAY, AND BOX HILL FOR THE NEXT,--THE WEATHER
APPEARING EXACTLY RIGHT.

UNDER A BRIGHT MID-DAY SUN, AT ALMOST MIDSUMMER, MR. WOODHOUSE
WAS SAFELY CONVEYED IN HIS CARRIAGE, WITH ONE WINDOW DOWN,
TO PARTAKE OF THIS AL-FRESCO PARTY; AND IN ONE OF THE MOST
COMFORTABLE ROOMS IN THE ABBEY, ESPECIALLY PREPARED FOR HIM BY A
FIRE ALL THE MORNING, HE WAS HAPPILY PLACED, QUITE AT HIS EASE,
READY TO TALK WITH PLEASURE OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACHIEVED, AND ADVISE
EVERY BODY TO COME AND SIT DOWN, AND NOT TO HEAT THEMSELVES.--
MRS. WESTON, WHO SEEMED TO HAVE WALKED THERE ON PURPOSE TO BE TIRED,
AND SIT ALL THE TIME WITH HIM, REMAINED, WHEN ALL THE OTHERS
WERE INVITED OR PERSUADED OUT, HIS PATIENT LISTENER AND SYMPATHISER.

IT WAS SO LONG SINCE EMMA HAD BEEN AT THE ABBEY, THAT AS SOON AS SHE
WAS SATISFIED OF HER FATHER'S COMFORT, SHE WAS GLAD TO LEAVE HIM,
AND LOOK AROUND HER; EAGER TO REFRESH AND CORRECT HER MEMORY WITH
MORE PARTICULAR OBSERVATION, MORE EXACT UNDERSTANDING OF A HOUSE
AND GROUNDS WHICH MUST EVER BE SO INTERESTING TO HER AND ALL HER FAMILY.

SHE FELT ALL THE HONEST PRIDE AND COMPLACENCY WHICH HER ALLIANCE
WITH THE PRESENT AND FUTURE PROPRIETOR COULD FAIRLY WARRANT,
AS SHE VIEWED THE RESPECTABLE SIZE AND STYLE OF THE BUILDING,
ITS SUITABLE, BECOMING, CHARACTERISTIC SITUATION, LOW AND SHELTERED--
ITS AMPLE GARDENS STRETCHING DOWN TO MEADOWS WASHED BY A STREAM,
OF WHICH THE ABBEY, WITH ALL THE OLD NEGLECT OF PROSPECT,
HAD SCARCELY A SIGHT--AND ITS ABUNDANCE OF TIMBER IN ROWS AND AVENUES,
WHICH NEITHER FASHION NOR EXTRAVAGANCE HAD ROOTED UP.--THE HOUSE
WAS LARGER THAN HARTFIELD, AND TOTALLY UNLIKE IT, COVERING A GOOD
DEAL OF GROUND, RAMBLING AND IRREGULAR, WITH MANY COMFORTABLE,
AND ONE OR TWO HANDSOME ROOMS.--IT WAS JUST WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE,
AND IT LOOKED WHAT IT WAS--AND EMMA FELT AN INCREASING RESPECT
FOR IT, AS THE RESIDENCE OF A FAMILY OF SUCH TRUE GENTILITY,
UNTAINTED IN BLOOD AND UNDERSTANDING.--SOME FAULTS OF TEMPER JOHN
KNIGHTLEY HAD; BUT ISABELLA HAD CONNECTED HERSELF UNEXCEPTIONABLY.
SHE HAD GIVEN THEM NEITHER MEN, NOR NAMES, NOR PLACES, THAT COULD
RAISE A BLUSH.  THESE WERE PLEASANT FEELINGS, AND SHE WALKED ABOUT
AND INDULGED THEM TILL IT WAS NECESSARY TO DO AS THE OTHERS DID,
AND COLLECT ROUND THE STRAWBERRY-BEDS.--THE WHOLE PARTY WERE ASSEMBLED,
EXCEPTING FRANK CHURCHILL, WHO WAS EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT FROM RICHMOND;
AND MRS. ELTON, IN ALL HER APPARATUS OF HAPPINESS, HER LARGE BONNET
AND HER BASKET, WAS VERY READY TO LEAD THE WAY IN GATHERING,
ACCEPTING, OR TALKING--STRAWBERRIES, AND ONLY STRAWBERRIES,
COULD NOW BE THOUGHT OR SPOKEN OF.--"THE BEST FRUIT IN ENGLAND--
EVERY BODY'S FAVOURITE--ALWAYS WHOLESOME.--THESE THE FINEST BEDS
AND FINEST SORTS.--DELIGHTFUL TO GATHER FOR ONE'S SELF--THE ONLY WAY
OF REALLY ENJOYING THEM.--MORNING DECIDEDLY THE BEST TIME--NEVER TIRED--
EVERY SORT GOOD--HAUTBOY INFINITELY SUPERIOR--NO COMPARISON--
THE OTHERS HARDLY EATABLE--HAUTBOYS VERY SCARCE--CHILI PREFERRED--
WHITE WOOD FINEST FLAVOUR OF ALL--PRICE OF STRAWBERRIES IN LONDON--
ABUNDANCE ABOUT BRISTOL--MAPLE GROVE--CULTIVATION--BEDS WHEN TO
BE RENEWED--GARDENERS THINKING EXACTLY DIFFERENT--NO GENERAL RULE--
GARDENERS NEVER TO BE PUT OUT OF THEIR WAY--DELICIOUS FRUIT--
ONLY TOO RICH TO BE EATEN MUCH OF--INFERIOR TO CHERRIES--
CURRANTS MORE REFRESHING--ONLY OBJECTION TO GATHERING STRAWBERRIES
THE STOOPING--GLARING SUN--TIRED TO DEATH--COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER--
MUST GO AND SIT IN THE SHADE."

SUCH, FOR HALF AN HOUR, WAS THE CONVERSATION--INTERRUPTED ONLY
ONCE BY MRS. WESTON, WHO CAME OUT, IN HER SOLICITUDE AFTER HER
SON-IN-LAW, TO INQUIRE IF HE WERE COME--AND SHE WAS A LITTLE UNEASY.--
SHE HAD SOME FEARS OF HIS HORSE.

SEATS TOLERABLY IN THE SHADE WERE FOUND; AND NOW EMMA WAS OBLIGED
TO OVERHEAR WHAT MRS. ELTON AND JANE FAIRFAX WERE TALKING OF.--
A SITUATION, A MOST DESIRABLE SITUATION, WAS IN QUESTION.  MRS. ELTON
HAD RECEIVED NOTICE OF IT THAT MORNING, AND WAS IN RAPTURES.
IT WAS NOT WITH MRS. SUCKLING, IT WAS NOT WITH MRS. BRAGGE,
BUT IN FELICITY AND SPLENDOUR IT FELL SHORT ONLY OF THEM:  IT WAS
WITH A COUSIN OF MRS. BRAGGE, AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MRS. SUCKLING,
A LADY KNOWN AT MAPLE GROVE.  DELIGHTFUL, CHARMING, SUPERIOR,
FIRST CIRCLES, SPHERES, LINES, RANKS, EVERY THING--AND MRS. ELTON
WAS WILD TO HAVE THE OFFER CLOSED WITH IMMEDIATELY.--ON HER SIDE,
ALL WAS WARMTH, ENERGY, AND TRIUMPH--AND SHE POSITIVELY REFUSED
TO TAKE HER FRIEND'S NEGATIVE, THOUGH MISS FAIRFAX CONTINUED
TO ASSURE HER THAT SHE WOULD NOT AT PRESENT ENGAGE IN ANY THING,
REPEATING THE SAME MOTIVES WHICH SHE HAD BEEN HEARD TO URGE BEFORE.--
STILL MRS. ELTON INSISTED ON BEING AUTHORISED TO WRITE AN ACQUIESCENCE
BY THE MORROW'S POST.--HOW JANE COULD BEAR IT AT ALL, WAS ASTONISHING
TO EMMA.--SHE DID LOOK VEXED, SHE DID SPEAK POINTEDLY--AND AT LAST,
WITH A DECISION OF ACTION UNUSUAL TO HER, PROPOSED A REMOVAL.--
"SHOULD NOT THEY WALK?  WOULD NOT MR. KNIGHTLEY SHEW THEM THE GARDENS--
ALL THE GARDENS?--SHE WISHED TO SEE THE WHOLE EXTENT."--THE PERTINACITY
OF HER FRIEND SEEMED MORE THAN SHE COULD BEAR.

IT WAS HOT; AND AFTER WALKING SOME TIME OVER THE GARDENS IN A SCATTERED,
DISPERSED WAY, SCARCELY ANY THREE TOGETHER, THEY INSENSIBLY
FOLLOWED ONE ANOTHER TO THE DELICIOUS SHADE OF A BROAD SHORT
AVENUE OF LIMES, WHICH STRETCHING BEYOND THE GARDEN AT AN EQUAL
DISTANCE FROM THE RIVER, SEEMED THE FINISH OF THE PLEASURE GROUNDS.--
IT LED TO NOTHING; NOTHING BUT A VIEW AT THE END OVER A LOW STONE
WALL WITH HIGH PILLARS, WHICH SEEMED INTENDED, IN THEIR ERECTION,
TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF AN APPROACH TO THE HOUSE, WHICH NEVER HAD
BEEN THERE.  DISPUTABLE, HOWEVER, AS MIGHT BE THE TASTE OF SUCH
A TERMINATION, IT WAS IN ITSELF A CHARMING WALK, AND THE VIEW
WHICH CLOSED IT EXTREMELY PRETTY.--THE CONSIDERABLE SLOPE, AT NEARLY
THE FOOT OF WHICH THE ABBEY STOOD, GRADUALLY ACQUIRED A STEEPER
FORM BEYOND ITS GROUNDS; AND AT HALF A MILE DISTANT WAS A BANK
OF CONSIDERABLE ABRUPTNESS AND GRANDEUR, WELL CLOTHED WITH WOOD;--
AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS BANK, FAVOURABLY PLACED AND SHELTERED,
ROSE THE ABBEY MILL FARM, WITH MEADOWS IN FRONT, AND THE RIVER
MAKING A CLOSE AND HANDSOME CURVE AROUND IT.

IT WAS A SWEET VIEW--SWEET TO THE EYE AND THE MIND.  ENGLISH VERDURE,
ENGLISH CULTURE, ENGLISH COMFORT, SEEN UNDER A SUN BRIGHT,
WITHOUT BEING OPPRESSIVE.

IN THIS WALK EMMA AND MR. WESTON FOUND ALL THE OTHERS ASSEMBLED;
AND TOWARDS THIS VIEW SHE IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED MR. KNIGHTLEY
AND HARRIET DISTINCT FROM THE REST, QUIETLY LEADING THE WAY.
MR. KNIGHTLEY AND HARRIET!--IT WAS AN ODD TETE-A-TETE; BUT SHE WAS
GLAD TO SEE IT.--THERE HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED
HER AS A COMPANION, AND TURNED FROM HER WITH LITTLE CEREMONY.
NOW THEY SEEMED IN PLEASANT CONVERSATION.  THERE HAD BEEN A TIME
ALSO WHEN EMMA WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY TO SEE HARRIET IN A SPOT
SO FAVOURABLE FOR THE ABBEY MILL FARM; BUT NOW SHE FEARED IT NOT.
IT MIGHT BE SAFELY VIEWED WITH ALL ITS APPENDAGES OF PROSPERITY
AND BEAUTY, ITS RICH PASTURES, SPREADING FLOCKS, ORCHARD IN BLOSSOM,
AND LIGHT COLUMN OF SMOKE ASCENDING.--SHE JOINED THEM AT THE WALL,
AND FOUND THEM MORE ENGAGED IN TALKING THAN IN LOOKING AROUND.
HE WAS GIVING HARRIET INFORMATION AS TO MODES OF AGRICULTURE, ETC.
AND EMMA RECEIVED A SMILE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY, "THESE ARE MY
OWN CONCERNS.  I HAVE A RIGHT TO TALK ON SUCH SUBJECTS, WITHOUT BEING
SUSPECTED OF INTRODUCING ROBERT MARTIN."--SHE DID NOT SUSPECT HIM.
IT WAS TOO OLD A STORY.--ROBERT MARTIN HAD PROBABLY CEASED TO THINK
OF HARRIET.--THEY TOOK A FEW TURNS TOGETHER ALONG THE WALK.--THE SHADE
WAS MOST REFRESHING, AND EMMA FOUND IT THE PLEASANTEST PART OF
THE DAY.

THE NEXT REMOVE WAS TO THE HOUSE; THEY MUST ALL GO IN AND EAT;--
AND THEY WERE ALL SEATED AND BUSY, AND STILL FRANK CHURCHILL DID
NOT COME.  MRS. WESTON LOOKED, AND LOOKED IN VAIN.  HIS FATHER WOULD
NOT OWN HIMSELF UNEASY, AND LAUGHED AT HER FEARS; BUT SHE COULD
NOT BE CURED OF WISHING THAT HE WOULD PART WITH HIS BLACK MARE.
HE HAD EXPRESSED HIMSELF AS TO COMING, WITH MORE THAN COMMON CERTAINTY.
"HIS AUNT WAS SO MUCH BETTER, THAT HE HAD NOT A DOUBT OF GETTING
OVER TO THEM."--MRS. CHURCHILL'S STATE, HOWEVER, AS MANY WERE READY
TO REMIND HER, WAS LIABLE TO SUCH SUDDEN VARIATION AS MIGHT DISAPPOINT
HER NEPHEW IN THE MOST REASONABLE DEPENDENCE--AND MRS. WESTON
WAS AT LAST PERSUADED TO BELIEVE, OR TO SAY, THAT IT MUST BE
BY SOME ATTACK OF MRS. CHURCHILL THAT HE WAS PREVENTED COMING.--
EMMA LOOKED AT HARRIET WHILE THE POINT WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION;
SHE BEHAVED VERY WELL, AND BETRAYED NO EMOTION.

THE COLD REPAST WAS OVER, AND THE PARTY WERE TO GO OUT ONCE MORE
TO SEE WHAT HAD NOT YET BEEN SEEN, THE OLD ABBEY FISH-PONDS;
PERHAPS GET AS FAR AS THE CLOVER, WHICH WAS TO BE BEGUN CUTTING
ON THE MORROW, OR, AT ANY RATE, HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEING HOT,
AND GROWING COOL AGAIN.--MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO HAD ALREADY TAKEN
HIS LITTLE ROUND IN THE HIGHEST PART OF THE GARDENS, WHERE NO
DAMPS FROM THE RIVER WERE IMAGINED EVEN BY HIM, STIRRED NO MORE;
AND HIS DAUGHTER RESOLVED TO REMAIN WITH HIM, THAT MRS. WESTON
MIGHT BE PERSUADED AWAY BY HER HUSBAND TO THE EXERCISE AND VARIETY
WHICH HER SPIRITS SEEMED TO NEED.

MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD DONE ALL IN HIS POWER FOR MR. WOODHOUSE'S
ENTERTAINMENT.  BOOKS OF ENGRAVINGS, DRAWERS OF MEDALS, CAMEOS,
CORALS, SHELLS, AND EVERY OTHER FAMILY COLLECTION WITHIN HIS CABINETS,
HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR HIS OLD FRIEND, TO WHILE AWAY THE MORNING;
AND THE KINDNESS HAD PERFECTLY ANSWERED.  MR. WOODHOUSE HAD BEEN
EXCEEDINGLY WELL AMUSED.  MRS. WESTON HAD BEEN SHEWING THEM ALL TO HIM,
AND NOW HE WOULD SHEW THEM ALL TO EMMA;--FORTUNATE IN HAVING NO OTHER
RESEMBLANCE TO A CHILD, THAN IN A TOTAL WANT OF TASTE FOR WHAT HE SAW,
FOR HE WAS SLOW, CONSTANT, AND METHODICAL.--BEFORE THIS SECOND LOOKING
OVER WAS BEGUN, HOWEVER, EMMA WALKED INTO THE HALL FOR THE SAKE
OF A FEW MOMENTS' FREE OBSERVATION OF THE ENTRANCE AND GROUND-PLOT
OF THE HOUSE--AND WAS HARDLY THERE, WHEN JANE FAIRFAX APPEARED,
COMING QUICKLY IN FROM THE GARDEN, AND WITH A LOOK OF ESCAPE.--
LITTLE EXPECTING TO MEET MISS WOODHOUSE SO SOON, THERE WAS A START
AT FIRST; BUT MISS WOODHOUSE WAS THE VERY PERSON SHE WAS IN QUEST OF.

"WILL YOU BE SO KIND," SAID SHE, "WHEN I AM MISSED, AS TO SAY
THAT I AM GONE HOME?--I AM GOING THIS MOMENT.--MY AUNT IS NOT AWARE
HOW LATE IT IS, NOR HOW LONG WE HAVE BEEN ABSENT--BUT I AM SURE WE
SHALL BE WANTED, AND I AM DETERMINED TO GO DIRECTLY.--I HAVE SAID
NOTHING ABOUT IT TO ANY BODY.  IT WOULD ONLY BE GIVING TROUBLE
AND DISTRESS.  SOME ARE GONE TO THE PONDS, AND SOME TO THE LIME WALK.
TILL THEY ALL COME IN I SHALL NOT BE MISSED; AND WHEN THEY DO,
WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SAY THAT I AM GONE?"

"CERTAINLY, IF YOU WISH IT;--BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WALK
TO HIGHBURY ALONE?"

"YES--WHAT SHOULD HURT ME?--I WALK FAST.  I SHALL BE AT HOME
IN TWENTY MINUTES."

"BUT IT IS TOO FAR, INDEED IT IS, TO BE WALKING QUITE ALONE.
LET MY FATHER'S SERVANT GO WITH YOU.--LET ME ORDER THE CARRIAGE.
IT CAN BE ROUND IN FIVE MINUTES."

"THANK YOU, THANK YOU--BUT ON NO ACCOUNT.--I WOULD RATHER WALK.--
AND FOR _ME_ TO BE AFRAID OF WALKING ALONE!--I, WHO MAY SO SOON HAVE
TO GUARD OTHERS!"

SHE SPOKE WITH GREAT AGITATION; AND EMMA VERY FEELINGLY REPLIED,
"THAT CAN BE NO REASON FOR YOUR BEING EXPOSED TO DANGER NOW.
I MUST ORDER THE CARRIAGE.  THE HEAT EVEN WOULD BE DANGER.--YOU ARE
FATIGUED ALREADY."

"I AM,"--SHE ANSWERED--"I AM FATIGUED; BUT IT IS NOT THE SORT
OF FATIGUE--QUICK WALKING WILL REFRESH ME.--MISS WOODHOUSE, WE ALL
KNOW AT TIMES WHAT IT IS TO BE WEARIED IN SPIRITS.  MINE, I CONFESS,
ARE EXHAUSTED.  THE GREATEST KINDNESS YOU CAN SHEW ME, WILL BE TO LET
ME HAVE MY OWN WAY, AND ONLY SAY THAT I AM GONE WHEN IT IS NECESSARY."

EMMA HAD NOT ANOTHER WORD TO OPPOSE.  SHE SAW IT ALL; AND ENTERING
INTO HER FEELINGS, PROMOTED HER QUITTING THE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY,
AND WATCHED HER SAFELY OFF WITH THE ZEAL OF A FRIEND.  HER PARTING
LOOK WAS GRATEFUL--AND HER PARTING WORDS, "OH!  MISS WOODHOUSE,
THE COMFORT OF BEING SOMETIMES ALONE!"--SEEMED TO BURST FROM
AN OVERCHARGED HEART, AND TO DESCRIBE SOMEWHAT OF THE CONTINUAL
ENDURANCE TO BE PRACTISED BY HER, EVEN TOWARDS SOME OF THOSE WHO
LOVED HER BEST.

"SUCH A HOME, INDEED! SUCH AN AUNT!" SAID EMMA, AS SHE TURNED BACK
INTO THE HALL AGAIN.  "I DO PITY YOU.  AND THE MORE SENSIBILITY
YOU BETRAY OF THEIR JUST HORRORS, THE MORE I SHALL LIKE YOU."

JANE HAD NOT BEEN GONE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, AND THEY HAD ONLY
ACCOMPLISHED SOME VIEWS OF ST. MARK'S PLACE, VENICE, WHEN FRANK
CHURCHILL ENTERED THE ROOM.  EMMA HAD NOT BEEN THINKING OF HIM,
SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO THINK OF HIM--BUT SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM.
MRS. WESTON WOULD BE AT EASE.  THE BLACK MARE WAS BLAMELESS;
_THEY_ WERE RIGHT WHO HAD NAMED MRS. CHURCHILL AS THE CAUSE.
HE HAD BEEN DETAINED BY A TEMPORARY INCREASE OF ILLNESS IN HER;
A NERVOUS SEIZURE, WHICH HAD LASTED SOME HOURS--AND HE HAD QUITE GIVEN
UP EVERY THOUGHT OF COMING, TILL VERY LATE;--AND HAD HE KNOWN HOW HOT
A RIDE HE SHOULD HAVE, AND HOW LATE, WITH ALL HIS HURRY, HE MUST BE,
HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD NOT HAVE COME AT ALL.  THE HEAT WAS EXCESSIVE;
HE HAD NEVER SUFFERED ANY THING LIKE IT--ALMOST WISHED HE HAD STAID
AT HOME--NOTHING KILLED HIM LIKE HEAT--HE COULD BEAR ANY DEGREE OF COLD,
ETC., BUT HEAT WAS INTOLERABLE--AND HE SAT DOWN, AT THE GREATEST
POSSIBLE DISTANCE FROM THE SLIGHT REMAINS OF MR. WOODHOUSE'S FIRE,
LOOKING VERY DEPLORABLE.

"YOU WILL SOON BE COOLER, IF YOU SIT STILL," SAID EMMA.

"AS SOON AS I AM COOLER I SHALL GO BACK AGAIN.  I COULD VERY
ILL BE SPARED--BUT SUCH A POINT HAD BEEN MADE OF MY COMING!
YOU WILL ALL BE GOING SOON I SUPPOSE; THE WHOLE PARTY BREAKING UP.
I MET _ONE_ AS I CAME--MADNESS IN SUCH WEATHER!--ABSOLUTE MADNESS!"

EMMA LISTENED, AND LOOKED, AND SOON PERCEIVED THAT FRANK CHURCHILL'S
STATE MIGHT BE BEST DEFINED BY THE EXPRESSIVE PHRASE OF BEING
OUT OF HUMOUR.  SOME PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS CROSS WHEN THEY WERE HOT.
SUCH MIGHT BE HIS CONSTITUTION; AND AS SHE KNEW THAT EATING
AND DRINKING WERE OFTEN THE CURE OF SUCH INCIDENTAL COMPLAINTS,
SHE RECOMMENDED HIS TAKING SOME REFRESHMENT; HE WOULD FIND ABUNDANCE
OF EVERY THING IN THE DINING-ROOM--AND SHE HUMANELY POINTED OUT
THE DOOR.

"NO--HE SHOULD NOT EAT.  HE WAS NOT HUNGRY; IT WOULD ONLY MAKE
HIM HOTTER."  IN TWO MINUTES, HOWEVER, HE RELENTED IN HIS OWN FAVOUR;
AND MUTTERING SOMETHING ABOUT SPRUCE-BEER, WALKED OFF.  EMMA RETURNED
ALL HER ATTENTION TO HER FATHER, SAYING IN SECRET--

"I AM GLAD I HAVE DONE BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM.  I SHOULD NOT LIKE A
MAN WHO IS SO SOON DISCOMPOSED BY A HOT MORNING.  HARRIET'S SWEET
EASY TEMPER WILL NOT MIND IT."

HE WAS GONE LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE HAD A VERY COMFORTABLE MEAL, AND CAME
BACK ALL THE BETTER--GROWN QUITE COOL--AND, WITH GOOD MANNERS,
LIKE HIMSELF--ABLE TO DRAW A CHAIR CLOSE TO THEM, TAKE AN INTEREST
IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT; AND REGRET, IN A REASONABLE WAY, THAT HE
SHOULD BE SO LATE.  HE WAS NOT IN HIS BEST SPIRITS, BUT SEEMED
TRYING TO IMPROVE THEM; AND, AT LAST, MADE HIMSELF TALK NONSENSE
VERY AGREEABLY.  THEY WERE LOOKING OVER VIEWS IN SWISSERLAND.

"AS SOON AS MY AUNT GETS WELL, I SHALL GO ABROAD," SAID HE.
"I SHALL NEVER BE EASY TILL I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THESE PLACES.
YOU WILL HAVE MY SKETCHES, SOME TIME OR OTHER, TO LOOK AT--OR MY TOUR
TO READ--OR MY POEM.  I SHALL DO SOMETHING TO EXPOSE MYSELF."

"THAT MAY BE--BUT NOT BY SKETCHES IN SWISSERLAND.  YOU WILL
NEVER GO TO SWISSERLAND.  YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT WILL NEVER ALLOW
YOU TO LEAVE ENGLAND."

"THEY MAY BE INDUCED TO GO TOO.  A WARM CLIMATE MAY BE PRESCRIBED
FOR HER.  I HAVE MORE THAN HALF AN EXPECTATION OF OUR ALL GOING ABROAD.
I ASSURE YOU I HAVE.  I FEEL A STRONG PERSUASION, THIS MORNING,
THAT I SHALL SOON BE ABROAD.  I OUGHT TO TRAVEL.  I AM TIRED
OF DOING NOTHING.  I WANT A CHANGE.  I AM SERIOUS, MISS WOODHOUSE,
WHATEVER YOUR PENETRATING EYES MAY FANCY--I AM SICK OF ENGLAND--
AND WOULD LEAVE IT TO-MORROW, IF I COULD."

"YOU ARE SICK OF PROSPERITY AND INDULGENCE.  CANNOT YOU INVENT
A FEW HARDSHIPS FOR YOURSELF, AND BE CONTENTED TO STAY?"

"_I_ SICK OF PROSPERITY AND INDULGENCE!  YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN.
I DO NOT LOOK UPON MYSELF AS EITHER PROSPEROUS OR INDULGED.  I AM
THWARTED IN EVERY THING MATERIAL.  I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF AT ALL
A FORTUNATE PERSON."

"YOU ARE NOT QUITE SO MISERABLE, THOUGH, AS WHEN YOU FIRST CAME.
GO AND EAT AND DRINK A LITTLE MORE, AND YOU WILL DO VERY WELL.
ANOTHER SLICE OF COLD MEAT, ANOTHER DRAUGHT OF MADEIRA AND WATER,
WILL MAKE YOU NEARLY ON A PAR WITH THE REST OF US."

"NO--I SHALL NOT STIR.  I SHALL SIT BY YOU.  YOU ARE MY BEST CURE."

"WE ARE GOING TO BOX HILL TO-MORROW;--YOU WILL JOIN US.
IT IS NOT SWISSERLAND, BUT IT WILL BE SOMETHING FOR A YOUNG
MAN SO MUCH IN WANT OF A CHANGE.  YOU WILL STAY, AND GO WITH US?"

"NO, CERTAINLY NOT; I SHALL GO HOME IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING."

"BUT YOU MAY COME AGAIN IN THE COOL OF TO-MORROW MORNING."

"NO--IT WILL NOT BE WORTH WHILE.  IF I COME, I SHALL BE CROSS."

"THEN PRAY STAY AT RICHMOND."

"BUT IF I DO, I SHALL BE CROSSER STILL.  I CAN NEVER BEAR TO THINK
OF YOU ALL THERE WITHOUT ME."

"THESE ARE DIFFICULTIES WHICH YOU MUST SETTLE FOR YOURSELF.
CHUSE YOUR OWN DEGREE OF CROSSNESS.  I SHALL PRESS YOU NO MORE."

THE REST OF THE PARTY WERE NOW RETURNING, AND ALL WERE SOON COLLECTED.
WITH SOME THERE WAS GREAT JOY AT THE SIGHT OF FRANK CHURCHILL;
OTHERS TOOK IT VERY COMPOSEDLY; BUT THERE WAS A VERY GENERAL DISTRESS
AND DISTURBANCE ON MISS FAIRFAX'S DISAPPEARANCE BEING EXPLAINED.
THAT IT WAS TIME FOR EVERY BODY TO GO, CONCLUDED THE SUBJECT; AND WITH
A SHORT FINAL ARRANGEMENT FOR THE NEXT DAY'S SCHEME, THEY PARTED.
FRANK CHURCHILL'S LITTLE INCLINATION TO EXCLUDE HIMSELF INCREASED
SO MUCH, THAT HIS LAST WORDS TO EMMA WERE,

"WELL;--IF _YOU_ WISH ME TO STAY AND JOIN THE PARTY, I WILL."

SHE SMILED HER ACCEPTANCE; AND NOTHING LESS THAN A SUMMONS FROM
RICHMOND WAS TO TAKE HIM BACK BEFORE THE FOLLOWING EVENING.



CHAPTER VII


THEY HAD A VERY FINE DAY FOR BOX HILL; AND ALL THE OTHER OUTWARD
CIRCUMSTANCES OF ARRANGEMENT, ACCOMMODATION, AND PUNCTUALITY,
WERE IN FAVOUR OF A PLEASANT PARTY.  MR. WESTON DIRECTED THE WHOLE,
OFFICIATING SAFELY BETWEEN HARTFIELD AND THE VICARAGE, AND EVERY
BODY WAS IN GOOD TIME.  EMMA AND HARRIET WENT TOGETHER; MISS BATES
AND HER NIECE, WITH THE ELTONS; THE GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK.
MRS. WESTON REMAINED WITH MR. WOODHOUSE.  NOTHING WAS WANTING
BUT TO BE HAPPY WHEN THEY GOT THERE.  SEVEN MILES WERE TRAVELLED
IN EXPECTATION OF ENJOYMENT, AND EVERY BODY HAD A BURST OF ADMIRATION
ON FIRST ARRIVING; BUT IN THE GENERAL AMOUNT OF THE DAY THERE
WAS DEFICIENCY.  THERE WAS A LANGUOR, A WANT OF SPIRITS, A WANT OF UNION,
WHICH COULD NOT BE GOT OVER.  THEY SEPARATED TOO MUCH INTO PARTIES.
THE ELTONS WALKED TOGETHER; MR. KNIGHTLEY TOOK CHARGE OF MISS
BATES AND JANE; AND EMMA AND HARRIET BELONGED TO FRANK CHURCHILL.
AND MR. WESTON TRIED, IN VAIN, TO MAKE THEM HARMONISE BETTER.  IT SEEMED
AT FIRST AN ACCIDENTAL DIVISION, BUT IT NEVER MATERIALLY VARIED.
MR. AND MRS. ELTON, INDEED, SHEWED NO UNWILLINGNESS TO MIX,
AND BE AS AGREEABLE AS THEY COULD; BUT DURING THE TWO WHOLE HOURS
THAT WERE SPENT ON THE HILL, THERE SEEMED A PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION,
BETWEEN THE OTHER PARTIES, TOO STRONG FOR ANY FINE PROSPECTS, OR ANY
COLD COLLATION, OR ANY CHEERFUL MR. WESTON, TO REMOVE.

AT FIRST IT WAS DOWNRIGHT DULNESS TO EMMA.  SHE HAD NEVER SEEN FRANK
CHURCHILL SO SILENT AND STUPID.  HE SAID NOTHING WORTH HEARING--
LOOKED WITHOUT SEEING--ADMIRED WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE--LISTENED WITHOUT
KNOWING WHAT SHE SAID.  WHILE HE WAS SO DULL, IT WAS NO WONDER THAT
HARRIET SHOULD BE DULL LIKEWISE; AND THEY WERE BOTH INSUFFERABLE.

WHEN THEY ALL SAT DOWN IT WAS BETTER; TO HER TASTE A GREAT DEAL BETTER,
FOR FRANK CHURCHILL GREW TALKATIVE AND GAY, MAKING HER HIS FIRST OBJECT.
EVERY DISTINGUISHING ATTENTION THAT COULD BE PAID, WAS PAID TO HER.
TO AMUSE HER, AND BE AGREEABLE IN HER EYES, SEEMED ALL THAT HE
CARED FOR--AND EMMA, GLAD TO BE ENLIVENED, NOT SORRY TO BE FLATTERED,
WAS GAY AND EASY TOO, AND GAVE HIM ALL THE FRIENDLY ENCOURAGEMENT,
THE ADMISSION TO BE GALLANT, WHICH SHE HAD EVER GIVEN IN THE FIRST
AND MOST ANIMATING PERIOD OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE; BUT WHICH NOW,
IN HER OWN ESTIMATION, MEANT NOTHING, THOUGH IN THE JUDGMENT OF MOST
PEOPLE LOOKING ON IT MUST HAVE HAD SUCH AN APPEARANCE AS NO ENGLISH
WORD BUT FLIRTATION COULD VERY WELL DESCRIBE.  "MR. FRANK CHURCHILL
AND MISS WOODHOUSE FLIRTED TOGETHER EXCESSIVELY."  THEY WERE LAYING
THEMSELVES OPEN TO THAT VERY PHRASE--AND TO HAVING IT SENT OFF
IN A LETTER TO MAPLE GROVE BY ONE LADY, TO IRELAND BY ANOTHER.
NOT THAT EMMA WAS GAY AND THOUGHTLESS FROM ANY REAL FELICITY;
IT WAS RATHER BECAUSE SHE FELT LESS HAPPY THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED.
SHE LAUGHED BECAUSE SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED; AND THOUGH SHE LIKED HIM
FOR HIS ATTENTIONS, AND THOUGHT THEM ALL, WHETHER IN FRIENDSHIP,
ADMIRATION, OR PLAYFULNESS, EXTREMELY JUDICIOUS, THEY WERE NOT WINNING
BACK HER HEART.  SHE STILL INTENDED HIM FOR HER FRIEND.

"HOW MUCH I AM OBLIGED TO YOU," SAID HE, "FOR TELLING ME TO COME TO-DAY!--
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR YOU, I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE LOST ALL THE
HAPPINESS OF THIS PARTY.  I HAD QUITE DETERMINED TO GO AWAY AGAIN."

"YES, YOU WERE VERY CROSS; AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ABOUT,
EXCEPT THAT YOU WERE TOO LATE FOR THE BEST STRAWBERRIES.
I WAS A KINDER FRIEND THAN YOU DESERVED.  BUT YOU WERE HUMBLE.
YOU BEGGED HARD TO BE COMMANDED TO COME."

"DON'T SAY I WAS CROSS.  I WAS FATIGUED.  THE HEAT OVERCAME ME."

"IT IS HOTTER TO-DAY."

"NOT TO MY FEELINGS.  I AM PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE TO-DAY."

"YOU ARE COMFORTABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE UNDER COMMAND."

"YOUR COMMAND?--YES."

"PERHAPS I INTENDED YOU TO SAY SO, BUT I MEANT SELF-COMMAND. YOU HAD,
SOMEHOW OR OTHER, BROKEN BOUNDS YESTERDAY, AND RUN AWAY FROM YOUR
OWN MANAGEMENT; BUT TO-DAY YOU ARE GOT BACK AGAIN--AND AS I CANNOT
BE ALWAYS WITH YOU, IT IS BEST TO BELIEVE YOUR TEMPER UNDER YOUR
OWN COMMAND RATHER THAN MINE."

"IT COMES TO THE SAME THING.  I CAN HAVE NO SELF-COMMAND WITHOUT
A MOTIVE.  YOU ORDER ME, WHETHER YOU SPEAK OR NOT.  AND YOU CAN
BE ALWAYS WITH ME.  YOU ARE ALWAYS WITH ME."

"DATING FROM THREE O'CLOCK YESTERDAY.  MY PERPETUAL INFLUENCE
COULD NOT BEGIN EARLIER, OR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO MUCH
OUT OF HUMOUR BEFORE."

"THREE O'CLOCK YESTERDAY!  THAT IS YOUR DATE.  I THOUGHT I HAD SEEN
YOU FIRST IN FEBRUARY."

"YOUR GALLANTRY IS REALLY UNANSWERABLE.  BUT (LOWERING HER VOICE)--
NOBODY SPEAKS EXCEPT OURSELVES, AND IT IS RATHER TOO MUCH TO BE
TALKING NONSENSE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF SEVEN SILENT PEOPLE."

"I SAY NOTHING OF WHICH I AM ASHAMED," REPLIED HE, WITH LIVELY IMPUDENCE.
"I SAW YOU FIRST IN FEBRUARY.  LET EVERY BODY ON THE HILL HEAR ME IF
THEY CAN.  LET MY ACCENTS SWELL TO MICKLEHAM ON ONE SIDE, AND DORKING
ON THE OTHER.  I SAW YOU FIRST IN FEBRUARY."  AND THEN WHISPERING--
"OUR COMPANIONS ARE EXCESSIVELY STUPID.  WHAT SHALL WE DO TO ROUSE THEM?
ANY NONSENSE WILL SERVE.  THEY _SHALL_ TALK.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I AM ORDERED BY MISS WOODHOUSE (WHO, WHEREVER SHE IS, PRESIDES)
TO SAY, THAT SHE DESIRES TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ALL THINKING OF?"

SOME LAUGHED, AND ANSWERED GOOD-HUMOUREDLY. MISS BATES SAID A GREAT DEAL;
MRS. ELTON SWELLED AT THE IDEA OF MISS WOODHOUSE'S PRESIDING;
MR. KNIGHTLEY'S ANSWER WAS THE MOST DISTINCT.

"IS MISS WOODHOUSE SURE THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT WE ARE
ALL THINKING OF?"

"OH! NO, NO"--CRIED EMMA, LAUGHING AS CARELESSLY AS SHE COULD--
"UPON NO ACCOUNT IN THE WORLD.  IT IS THE VERY LAST THING I
WOULD STAND THE BRUNT OF JUST NOW.  LET ME HEAR ANY THING RATHER
THAN WHAT YOU ARE ALL THINKING OF.  I WILL NOT SAY QUITE ALL.
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO, PERHAPS, (GLANCING AT MR. WESTON AND HARRIET,)
WHOSE THOUGHTS I MIGHT NOT BE AFRAID OF KNOWING."

"IT IS A SORT OF THING," CRIED MRS. ELTON EMPHATICALLY,
"WHICH _I_ SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT MYSELF PRIVILEGED TO
INQUIRE INTO.  THOUGH, PERHAPS, AS THE _CHAPERON_ OF THE PARTY--
_I_ NEVER WAS IN ANY CIRCLE--EXPLORING PARTIES--YOUNG LADIES--MARRIED WOMEN--"

HER MUTTERINGS WERE CHIEFLY TO HER HUSBAND; AND HE MURMURED,
IN REPLY,

"VERY TRUE, MY LOVE, VERY TRUE.  EXACTLY SO, INDEED--QUITE UNHEARD OF--
BUT SOME LADIES SAY ANY THING.  BETTER PASS IT OFF AS A JOKE.
EVERY BODY KNOWS WHAT IS DUE TO _YOU_."

"IT WILL NOT DO," WHISPERED FRANK TO EMMA; "THEY ARE MOST
OF THEM AFFRONTED.  I WILL ATTACK THEM WITH MORE ADDRESS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN--I AM ORDERED BY MISS WOODHOUSE TO SAY, THAT SHE
WAIVES HER RIGHT OF KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT YOU MAY ALL BE THINKING OF,
AND ONLY REQUIRES SOMETHING VERY ENTERTAINING FROM EACH OF YOU,
IN A GENERAL WAY.  HERE ARE SEVEN OF YOU, BESIDES MYSELF, (WHO, SHE
IS PLEASED TO SAY, AM VERY ENTERTAINING ALREADY,) AND SHE ONLY
DEMANDS FROM EACH OF YOU EITHER ONE THING VERY CLEVER, BE IT PROSE
OR VERSE, ORIGINAL OR REPEATED--OR TWO THINGS MODERATELY CLEVER--
OR THREE THINGS VERY DULL INDEED, AND SHE ENGAGES TO LAUGH HEARTILY
AT THEM ALL."

"OH! VERY WELL," EXCLAIMED MISS BATES, "THEN I NEED NOT BE UNEASY.
`THREE THINGS VERY DULL INDEED.'  THAT WILL JUST DO FOR ME, YOU KNOW.
I SHALL BE SURE TO SAY THREE DULL THINGS AS SOON AS EVER I OPEN
MY MOUTH, SHAN'T I? (LOOKING ROUND WITH THE MOST GOOD-HUMOURED
DEPENDENCE ON EVERY BODY'S ASSENT)--DO NOT YOU ALL THINK I SHALL?"

EMMA COULD NOT RESIST.

"AH! MA'AM, BUT THERE MAY BE A DIFFICULTY.  PARDON ME--BUT YOU
WILL BE LIMITED AS TO NUMBER--ONLY THREE AT ONCE."

MISS BATES, DECEIVED BY THE MOCK CEREMONY OF HER MANNER, DID NOT
IMMEDIATELY CATCH HER MEANING; BUT, WHEN IT BURST ON HER, IT COULD
NOT ANGER, THOUGH A SLIGHT BLUSH SHEWED THAT IT COULD PAIN HER.

"AH!--WELL--TO BE SURE.  YES, I SEE WHAT SHE MEANS, (TURNING TO
MR. KNIGHTLEY,) AND I WILL TRY TO HOLD MY TONGUE.  I MUST MAKE
MYSELF VERY DISAGREEABLE, OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE SAID SUCH A THING
TO AN OLD FRIEND."

"I LIKE YOUR PLAN," CRIED MR. WESTON.  "AGREED, AGREED.  I WILL DO
MY BEST.  I AM MAKING A CONUNDRUM.  HOW WILL A CONUNDRUM RECKON?"

"LOW, I AM AFRAID, SIR, VERY LOW," ANSWERED HIS SON;--"BUT WE SHALL
BE INDULGENT--ESPECIALLY TO ANY ONE WHO LEADS THE WAY."

"NO, NO," SAID EMMA, "IT WILL NOT RECKON LOW.  A CONUNDRUM OF
MR. WESTON'S SHALL CLEAR HIM AND HIS NEXT NEIGHBOUR.  COME, SIR,
PRAY LET ME HEAR IT."

"I DOUBT ITS BEING VERY CLEVER MYSELF," SAID MR. WESTON.
"IT IS TOO MUCH A MATTER OF FACT, BUT HERE IT IS.--WHAT TWO LETTERS
OF THE ALPHABET ARE THERE, THAT EXPRESS PERFECTION?"

"WHAT TWO LETTERS!--EXPRESS PERFECTION!  I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW."

"AH! YOU WILL NEVER GUESS.  YOU, (TO EMMA), I AM CERTAIN, WILL
NEVER GUESS.--I WILL TELL YOU.--M. AND A.--EM-MA.--DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"

UNDERSTANDING AND GRATIFICATION CAME TOGETHER.  IT MIGHT BE A VERY
INDIFFERENT PIECE OF WIT, BUT EMMA FOUND A GREAT DEAL TO LAUGH
AT AND ENJOY IN IT--AND SO DID FRANK AND HARRIET.--IT DID NOT SEEM
TO TOUCH THE REST OF THE PARTY EQUALLY; SOME LOOKED VERY STUPID
ABOUT IT, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY GRAVELY SAID,

"THIS EXPLAINS THE SORT OF CLEVER THING THAT IS WANTED, AND MR. WESTON
HAS DONE VERY WELL FOR HIMSELF; BUT HE MUST HAVE KNOCKED UP EVERY
BODY ELSE.  _PERFECTION_ SHOULD NOT HAVE COME QUITE SO SOON."

"OH! FOR MYSELF, I PROTEST I MUST BE EXCUSED," SAID MRS. ELTON;
"_I_ REALLY CANNOT ATTEMPT--I AM NOT AT ALL FOND OF THE SORT OF THING.
I HAD AN ACROSTIC ONCE SENT TO ME UPON MY OWN NAME, WHICH I WAS NOT
AT ALL PLEASED WITH.  I KNEW WHO IT CAME FROM.  AN ABOMINABLE PUPPY!--
YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN (NODDING TO HER HUSBAND). THESE KIND OF THINGS
ARE VERY WELL AT CHRISTMAS, WHEN ONE IS SITTING ROUND THE FIRE;
BUT QUITE OUT OF PLACE, IN MY OPINION, WHEN ONE IS EXPLORING
ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN SUMMER.  MISS WOODHOUSE MUST EXCUSE ME.
I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE WITTY THINGS AT EVERY BODY'S SERVICE.
I DO NOT PRETEND TO BE A WIT.  I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF VIVACITY
IN MY OWN WAY, BUT I REALLY MUST BE ALLOWED TO JUDGE WHEN TO SPEAK
AND WHEN TO HOLD MY TONGUE.  PASS US, IF YOU PLEASE, MR. CHURCHILL.
PASS MR. E., KNIGHTLEY, JANE, AND MYSELF.  WE HAVE NOTHING CLEVER TO SAY--
NOT ONE OF US.

"YES, YES, PRAY PASS _ME_," ADDED HER HUSBAND, WITH A SORT OF
SNEERING CONSCIOUSNESS; "_I_ HAVE NOTHING TO SAY THAT CAN ENTERTAIN
MISS WOODHOUSE, OR ANY OTHER YOUNG LADY.  AN OLD MARRIED MAN--
QUITE GOOD FOR NOTHING.  SHALL WE WALK, AUGUSTA?"

"WITH ALL MY HEART.  I AM REALLY TIRED OF EXPLORING SO LONG
ON ONE SPOT.  COME, JANE, TAKE MY OTHER ARM."

JANE DECLINED IT, HOWEVER, AND THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WALKED OFF.
"HAPPY COUPLE!" SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT
OF HEARING:--"HOW WELL THEY SUIT ONE ANOTHER!--VERY LUCKY--MARRYING AS
THEY DID, UPON AN ACQUAINTANCE FORMED ONLY IN A PUBLIC PLACE!--THEY ONLY
KNEW EACH OTHER, I THINK, A FEW WEEKS IN BATH!  PECULIARLY LUCKY!--
FOR AS TO ANY REAL KNOWLEDGE OF A PERSON'S DISPOSITION THAT BATH,
OR ANY PUBLIC PLACE, CAN GIVE--IT IS ALL NOTHING; THERE CAN BE
NO KNOWLEDGE.  IT IS ONLY BY SEEING WOMEN IN THEIR OWN HOMES,
AMONG THEIR OWN SET, JUST AS THEY ALWAYS ARE, THAT YOU CAN FORM
ANY JUST JUDGMENT.  SHORT OF THAT, IT IS ALL GUESS AND LUCK--
AND WILL GENERALLY BE ILL-LUCK. HOW MANY A MAN HAS COMMITTED HIMSELF
ON A SHORT ACQUAINTANCE, AND RUED IT ALL THE REST OF HIS LIFE!"

MISS FAIRFAX, WHO HAD SELDOM SPOKEN BEFORE, EXCEPT AMONG HER
OWN CONFEDERATES, SPOKE NOW.

"SUCH THINGS DO OCCUR, UNDOUBTEDLY."--SHE WAS STOPPED BY A COUGH.
FRANK CHURCHILL TURNED TOWARDS HER TO LISTEN.

"YOU WERE SPEAKING," SAID HE, GRAVELY.  SHE RECOVERED HER VOICE.

"I WAS ONLY GOING TO OBSERVE, THAT THOUGH SUCH UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES
DO SOMETIMES OCCUR BOTH TO MEN AND WOMEN, I CANNOT IMAGINE THEM
TO BE VERY FREQUENT.  A HASTY AND IMPRUDENT ATTACHMENT MAY ARISE--
BUT THERE IS GENERALLY TIME TO RECOVER FROM IT AFTERWARDS.  I WOULD
BE UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN, THAT IT CAN BE ONLY WEAK, IRRESOLUTE CHARACTERS,
(WHOSE HAPPINESS MUST BE ALWAYS AT THE MERCY OF CHANCE,)
WHO WILL SUFFER AN UNFORTUNATE ACQUAINTANCE TO BE AN INCONVENIENCE,
AN OPPRESSION FOR EVER."

HE MADE NO ANSWER; MERELY LOOKED, AND BOWED IN SUBMISSION; AND SOON
AFTERWARDS SAID, IN A LIVELY TONE,

"WELL, I HAVE SO LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN MY OWN JUDGMENT, THAT WHENEVER
I MARRY, I HOPE SOME BODY WILL CHUSE MY WIFE FOR ME.  WILL YOU?
(TURNING TO EMMA.) WILL YOU CHUSE A WIFE FOR ME?--I AM SURE I
SHOULD LIKE ANY BODY FIXED ON BY YOU.  YOU PROVIDE FOR THE FAMILY,
YOU KNOW, (WITH A SMILE AT HIS FATHER). FIND SOME BODY FOR ME.
I AM IN NO HURRY.  ADOPT HER, EDUCATE HER."

"AND MAKE HER LIKE MYSELF."

"BY ALL MEANS, IF YOU CAN."

"VERY WELL.  I UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION.  YOU SHALL HAVE A CHARMING WIFE."

"SHE MUST BE VERY LIVELY, AND HAVE HAZLE EYES.  I CARE FOR NOTHING ELSE.
I SHALL GO ABROAD FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS--AND WHEN I RETURN,
I SHALL COME TO YOU FOR MY WIFE.  REMEMBER."

EMMA WAS IN NO DANGER OF FORGETTING.  IT WAS A COMMISSION TO TOUCH EVERY
FAVOURITE FEELING.  WOULD NOT HARRIET BE THE VERY CREATURE DESCRIBED?
HAZLE EYES EXCEPTED, TWO YEARS MORE MIGHT MAKE HER ALL THAT HE WISHED.
HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE HARRIET IN HIS THOUGHTS AT THE MOMENT;
WHO COULD SAY?  REFERRING THE EDUCATION TO HER SEEMED TO IMPLY IT.

"NOW, MA'AM," SAID JANE TO HER AUNT, "SHALL WE JOIN MRS. ELTON?"

"IF YOU PLEASE, MY DEAR.  WITH ALL MY HEART.  I AM QUITE READY.
I WAS READY TO HAVE GONE WITH HER, BUT THIS WILL DO JUST AS WELL.
WE SHALL SOON OVERTAKE HER.  THERE SHE IS--NO, THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE.
THAT'S ONE OF THE LADIES IN THE IRISH CAR PARTY, NOT AT ALL LIKE HER.--
WELL, I DECLARE--"

THEY WALKED OFF, FOLLOWED IN HALF A MINUTE BY MR. KNIGHTLEY.
MR. WESTON, HIS SON, EMMA, AND HARRIET, ONLY REMAINED; AND THE YOUNG
MAN'S SPIRITS NOW ROSE TO A PITCH ALMOST UNPLEASANT.  EVEN EMMA GREW
TIRED AT LAST OF FLATTERY AND MERRIMENT, AND WISHED HERSELF RATHER
WALKING QUIETLY ABOUT WITH ANY OF THE OTHERS, OR SITTING ALMOST ALONE,
AND QUITE UNATTENDED TO, IN TRANQUIL OBSERVATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL
VIEWS BENEATH HER.  THE APPEARANCE OF THE SERVANTS LOOKING OUT
FOR THEM TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE CARRIAGES WAS A JOYFUL SIGHT;
AND EVEN THE BUSTLE OF COLLECTING AND PREPARING TO DEPART,
AND THE SOLICITUDE OF MRS. ELTON TO HAVE _HER_ CARRIAGE FIRST,
WERE GLADLY ENDURED, IN THE PROSPECT OF THE QUIET DRIVE HOME WHICH WAS
TO CLOSE THE VERY QUESTIONABLE ENJOYMENTS OF THIS DAY OF PLEASURE.
SUCH ANOTHER SCHEME, COMPOSED OF SO MANY ILL-ASSORTED PEOPLE,
SHE HOPED NEVER TO BE BETRAYED INTO AGAIN.

WHILE WAITING FOR THE CARRIAGE, SHE FOUND MR. KNIGHTLEY BY HER SIDE.
HE LOOKED AROUND, AS IF TO SEE THAT NO ONE WERE NEAR, AND THEN SAID,

"EMMA, I MUST ONCE MORE SPEAK TO YOU AS I HAVE BEEN USED TO DO:
A PRIVILEGE RATHER ENDURED THAN ALLOWED, PERHAPS, BUT I MUST STILL
USE IT.  I CANNOT SEE YOU ACTING WRONG, WITHOUT A REMONSTRANCE.
HOW COULD YOU BE SO UNFEELING TO MISS BATES?  HOW COULD YOU BE SO
INSOLENT IN YOUR WIT TO A WOMAN OF HER CHARACTER, AGE, AND SITUATION?--
EMMA, I HAD NOT THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE."

EMMA RECOLLECTED, BLUSHED, WAS SORRY, BUT TRIED TO LAUGH IT OFF.

"NAY, HOW COULD I HELP SAYING WHAT I DID?--NOBODY COULD HAVE HELPED IT.
IT WAS NOT SO VERY BAD.  I DARE SAY SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND ME."

"I ASSURE YOU SHE DID.  SHE FELT YOUR FULL MEANING.  SHE HAS TALKED
OF IT SINCE.  I WISH YOU COULD HAVE HEARD HOW SHE TALKED OF IT--
WITH WHAT CANDOUR AND GENEROSITY.  I WISH YOU COULD HAVE HEARD HER
HONOURING YOUR FORBEARANCE, IN BEING ABLE TO PAY HER SUCH ATTENTIONS,
AS SHE WAS FOR EVER RECEIVING FROM YOURSELF AND YOUR FATHER,
WHEN HER SOCIETY MUST BE SO IRKSOME."

"OH!" CRIED EMMA, "I KNOW THERE IS NOT A BETTER CREATURE IN THE WORLD:
BUT YOU MUST ALLOW, THAT WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS RIDICULOUS ARE
MOST UNFORTUNATELY BLENDED IN HER."

"THEY ARE BLENDED," SAID HE, "I ACKNOWLEDGE; AND, WERE SHE PROSPEROUS,
I COULD ALLOW MUCH FOR THE OCCASIONAL PREVALENCE OF THE RIDICULOUS
OVER THE GOOD.  WERE SHE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE, I WOULD LEAVE EVERY
HARMLESS ABSURDITY TO TAKE ITS CHANCE, I WOULD NOT QUARREL WITH YOU
FOR ANY LIBERTIES OF MANNER.  WERE SHE YOUR EQUAL IN SITUATION--
BUT, EMMA, CONSIDER HOW FAR THIS IS FROM BEING THE CASE.  SHE IS POOR;
SHE HAS SUNK FROM THE COMFORTS SHE WAS BORN TO; AND, IF SHE LIVE
TO OLD AGE, MUST PROBABLY SINK MORE.  HER SITUATION SHOULD SECURE
YOUR COMPASSION.  IT WAS BADLY DONE, INDEED!  YOU, WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN
FROM AN INFANT, WHOM SHE HAD SEEN GROW UP FROM A PERIOD WHEN HER
NOTICE WAS AN HONOUR, TO HAVE YOU NOW, IN THOUGHTLESS SPIRITS,
AND THE PRIDE OF THE MOMENT, LAUGH AT HER, HUMBLE HER--AND BEFORE
HER NIECE, TOO--AND BEFORE OTHERS, MANY OF WHOM (CERTAINLY _SOME_,)
WOULD BE ENTIRELY GUIDED BY _YOUR_ TREATMENT OF HER.--THIS IS NOT
PLEASANT TO YOU, EMMA--AND IT IS VERY FAR FROM PLEASANT TO ME;
BUT I MUST, I WILL,--I WILL TELL YOU TRUTHS WHILE I CAN;
SATISFIED WITH PROVING MYSELF YOUR FRIEND BY VERY FAITHFUL COUNSEL,
AND TRUSTING THAT YOU WILL SOME TIME OR OTHER DO ME GREATER JUSTICE
THAN YOU CAN DO NOW."

WHILE THEY TALKED, THEY WERE ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CARRIAGE;
IT WAS READY; AND, BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK AGAIN, HE HAD HANDED HER IN.
HE HAD MISINTERPRETED THE FEELINGS WHICH HAD KEPT HER FACE AVERTED,
AND HER TONGUE MOTIONLESS.  THEY WERE COMBINED ONLY OF ANGER
AGAINST HERSELF, MORTIFICATION, AND DEEP CONCERN.  SHE HAD NOT
BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK; AND, ON ENTERING THE CARRIAGE, SUNK BACK
FOR A MOMENT OVERCOME--THEN REPROACHING HERSELF FOR HAVING TAKEN
NO LEAVE, MAKING NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT, PARTING IN APPARENT SULLENNESS,
SHE LOOKED OUT WITH VOICE AND HAND EAGER TO SHEW A DIFFERENCE;
BUT IT WAS JUST TOO LATE.  HE HAD TURNED AWAY, AND THE HORSES WERE
IN MOTION.  SHE CONTINUED TO LOOK BACK, BUT IN VAIN; AND SOON,
WITH WHAT APPEARED UNUSUAL SPEED, THEY WERE HALF WAY DOWN THE HILL,
AND EVERY THING LEFT FAR BEHIND.  SHE WAS VEXED BEYOND WHAT COULD
HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED--ALMOST BEYOND WHAT SHE COULD CONCEAL.
NEVER HAD SHE FELT SO AGITATED, MORTIFIED, GRIEVED, AT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE
IN HER LIFE.  SHE WAS MOST FORCIBLY STRUCK.  THE TRUTH OF THIS
REPRESENTATION THERE WAS NO DENYING.  SHE FELT IT AT HER HEART.
HOW COULD SHE HAVE BEEN SO BRUTAL, SO CRUEL TO MISS BATES!  HOW COULD
SHE HAVE EXPOSED HERSELF TO SUCH ILL OPINION IN ANY ONE SHE VALUED!
AND HOW SUFFER HIM TO LEAVE HER WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD OF GRATITUDE,
OF CONCURRENCE, OF COMMON KINDNESS!

TIME DID NOT COMPOSE HER.  AS SHE REFLECTED MORE, SHE SEEMED
BUT TO FEEL IT MORE.  SHE NEVER HAD BEEN SO DEPRESSED.  HAPPILY IT
WAS NOT NECESSARY TO SPEAK.  THERE WAS ONLY HARRIET, WHO SEEMED NOT
IN SPIRITS HERSELF, FAGGED, AND VERY WILLING TO BE SILENT; AND EMMA
FELT THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER CHEEKS ALMOST ALL THE WAY HOME,
WITHOUT BEING AT ANY TROUBLE TO CHECK THEM, EXTRAORDINARY AS THEY WERE.



CHAPTER VIII


THE WRETCHEDNESS OF A SCHEME TO BOX HILL WAS IN EMMA'S THOUGHTS ALL
THE EVENING.  HOW IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED BY THE REST OF THE PARTY,
SHE COULD NOT TELL.  THEY, IN THEIR DIFFERENT HOMES, AND THEIR DIFFERENT
WAYS, MIGHT BE LOOKING BACK ON IT WITH PLEASURE; BUT IN HER VIEW IT
WAS A MORNING MORE COMPLETELY MISSPENT, MORE TOTALLY BARE OF RATIONAL
SATISFACTION AT THE TIME, AND MORE TO BE ABHORRED IN RECOLLECTION,
THAN ANY SHE HAD EVER PASSED.  A WHOLE EVENING OF BACK-GAMMON WITH
HER FATHER, WAS FELICITY TO IT.  _THERE_, INDEED, LAY REAL PLEASURE,
FOR THERE SHE WAS GIVING UP THE SWEETEST HOURS OF THE TWENTY-FOUR
TO HIS COMFORT; AND FEELING THAT, UNMERITED AS MIGHT BE THE DEGREE
OF HIS FOND AFFECTION AND CONFIDING ESTEEM, SHE COULD NOT, IN HER
GENERAL CONDUCT, BE OPEN TO ANY SEVERE REPROACH.  AS A DAUGHTER,
SHE HOPED SHE WAS NOT WITHOUT A HEART.  SHE HOPED NO ONE COULD
HAVE SAID TO HER, "HOW COULD YOU BE SO UNFEELING TO YOUR FATHER?--
I MUST, I WILL TELL YOU TRUTHS WHILE I CAN."  MISS BATES SHOULD
NEVER AGAIN--NO, NEVER!  IF ATTENTION, IN FUTURE, COULD DO AWAY
THE PAST, SHE MIGHT HOPE TO BE FORGIVEN.  SHE HAD BEEN OFTEN REMISS,
HER CONSCIENCE TOLD HER SO; REMISS, PERHAPS, MORE IN THOUGHT
THAN FACT; SCORNFUL, UNGRACIOUS.  BUT IT SHOULD BE SO NO MORE.
IN THE WARMTH OF TRUE CONTRITION, SHE WOULD CALL UPON HER THE
VERY NEXT MORNING, AND IT SHOULD BE THE BEGINNING, ON HER SIDE,
OF A REGULAR, EQUAL, KINDLY INTERCOURSE.

SHE WAS JUST AS DETERMINED WHEN THE MORROW CAME, AND WENT EARLY,
THAT NOTHING MIGHT PREVENT HER.  IT WAS NOT UNLIKELY, SHE THOUGHT,
THAT SHE MIGHT SEE MR. KNIGHTLEY IN HER WAY; OR, PERHAPS, HE MIGHT
COME IN WHILE SHE WERE PAYING HER VISIT.  SHE HAD NO OBJECTION.
SHE WOULD NOT BE ASHAMED OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE PENITENCE, SO JUSTLY
AND TRULY HERS.  HER EYES WERE TOWARDS DONWELL AS SHE WALKED, BUT SHE
SAW HIM NOT.

"THE LADIES WERE ALL AT HOME."  SHE HAD NEVER REJOICED AT THE SOUND
BEFORE, NOR EVER BEFORE ENTERED THE PASSAGE, NOR WALKED UP THE STAIRS,
WITH ANY WISH OF GIVING PLEASURE, BUT IN CONFERRING OBLIGATION,
OR OF DERIVING IT, EXCEPT IN SUBSEQUENT RIDICULE.

THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON HER APPROACH; A GOOD DEAL OF MOVING AND TALKING.
SHE HEARD MISS BATES'S VOICE, SOMETHING WAS TO BE DONE IN A HURRY;
THE MAID LOOKED FRIGHTENED AND AWKWARD; HOPED SHE WOULD BE PLEASED
TO WAIT A MOMENT, AND THEN USHERED HER IN TOO SOON.  THE AUNT AND
NIECE SEEMED BOTH ESCAPING INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM.  JANE SHE HAD
A DISTINCT GLIMPSE OF, LOOKING EXTREMELY ILL; AND, BEFORE THE DOOR
HAD SHUT THEM OUT, SHE HEARD MISS BATES SAYING, "WELL, MY DEAR,
I SHALL _SAY_ YOU ARE LAID DOWN UPON THE BED, AND I AM SURE YOU ARE
ILL ENOUGH."

POOR OLD MRS. BATES, CIVIL AND HUMBLE AS USUAL, LOOKED AS IF SHE
DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON.

"I AM AFRAID JANE IS NOT VERY WELL," SAID SHE, "BUT I DO NOT KNOW;
THEY _TELL_ ME SHE IS WELL.  I DARE SAY MY DAUGHTER WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY,
MISS WOODHOUSE.  I HOPE YOU FIND A CHAIR.  I WISH HETTY HAD NOT GONE.
I AM VERY LITTLE ABLE--HAVE YOU A CHAIR, MA'AM? DO YOU SIT WHERE
YOU LIKE?  I AM SURE SHE WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY."

EMMA SERIOUSLY HOPED SHE WOULD.  SHE HAD A MOMENT'S FEAR OF MISS
BATES KEEPING AWAY FROM HER.  BUT MISS BATES SOON CAME--"VERY HAPPY
AND OBLIGED"--BUT EMMA'S CONSCIENCE TOLD HER THAT THERE WAS NOT THE
SAME CHEERFUL VOLUBILITY AS BEFORE--LESS EASE OF LOOK AND MANNER.
A VERY FRIENDLY INQUIRY AFTER MISS FAIRFAX, SHE HOPED, MIGHT LEAD
THE WAY TO A RETURN OF OLD FEELINGS.  THE TOUCH SEEMED IMMEDIATE.

"AH!  MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW KIND YOU ARE!--I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD--
AND ARE COME TO GIVE US JOY.  THIS DOES NOT SEEM MUCH LIKE JOY,
INDEED, IN ME--(TWINKLING AWAY A TEAR OR TWO)--BUT IT WILL BE
VERY TRYING FOR US TO PART WITH HER, AFTER HAVING HAD HER SO LONG,
AND SHE HAS A DREADFUL HEADACHE JUST NOW, WRITING ALL THE MORNING:--
SUCH LONG LETTERS, YOU KNOW, TO BE WRITTEN TO COLONEL CAMPBELL,
AND MRS. DIXON.  `MY DEAR,' SAID I, `YOU WILL BLIND YOURSELF'--
FOR TEARS WERE IN HER EYES PERPETUALLY.  ONE CANNOT WONDER,
ONE CANNOT WONDER.  IT IS A GREAT CHANGE; AND THOUGH SHE IS
AMAZINGLY FORTUNATE--SUCH A SITUATION, I SUPPOSE, AS NO YOUNG WOMAN
BEFORE EVER MET WITH ON FIRST GOING OUT--DO NOT THINK US UNGRATEFUL,
MISS WOODHOUSE, FOR SUCH SURPRISING GOOD FORTUNE--(AGAIN DISPERSING
HER TEARS)--BUT, POOR DEAR SOUL! IF YOU WERE TO SEE WHAT A HEADACHE
SHE HAS.  WHEN ONE IS IN GREAT PAIN, YOU KNOW ONE CANNOT FEEL
ANY BLESSING QUITE AS IT MAY DESERVE.  SHE IS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE.
TO LOOK AT HER, NOBODY WOULD THINK HOW DELIGHTED AND HAPPY SHE
IS TO HAVE SECURED SUCH A SITUATION.  YOU WILL EXCUSE HER NOT
COMING TO YOU--SHE IS NOT ABLE--SHE IS GONE INTO HER OWN ROOM--
I WANT HER TO LIE DOWN UPON THE BED.  `MY DEAR,' SAID I, `I SHALL
SAY YOU ARE LAID DOWN UPON THE BED:'  BUT, HOWEVER, SHE IS NOT;
SHE IS WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM.  BUT, NOW THAT SHE HAS WRITTEN
HER LETTERS, SHE SAYS SHE SHALL SOON BE WELL.  SHE WILL BE EXTREMELY
SORRY TO MISS SEEING YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, BUT YOUR KINDNESS WILL
EXCUSE HER.  YOU WERE KEPT WAITING AT THE DOOR--I WAS QUITE ASHAMED--
BUT SOMEHOW THERE WAS A LITTLE BUSTLE--FOR IT SO HAPPENED THAT WE
HAD NOT HEARD THE KNOCK, AND TILL YOU WERE ON THE STAIRS, WE DID
NOT KNOW ANY BODY WAS COMING.  `IT IS ONLY MRS. COLE,' SAID I,
`DEPEND UPON IT.  NOBODY ELSE WOULD COME SO EARLY.'  `WELL,' SAID SHE,
`IT MUST BE BORNE SOME TIME OR OTHER, AND IT MAY AS WELL BE NOW.'
BUT THEN PATTY CAME IN, AND SAID IT WAS YOU.  `OH!' SAID I,
`IT IS MISS WOODHOUSE:  I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE TO SEE HER.'--
`I CAN SEE NOBODY,' SAID SHE; AND UP SHE GOT, AND WOULD GO AWAY;
AND THAT WAS WHAT MADE US KEEP YOU WAITING--AND EXTREMELY SORRY
AND ASHAMED WE WERE.  `IF YOU MUST GO, MY DEAR,' SAID I, `YOU MUST,
AND I WILL SAY YOU ARE LAID DOWN UPON THE BED.'"

EMMA WAS MOST SINCERELY INTERESTED.  HER HEART HAD BEEN LONG GROWING
KINDER TOWARDS JANE; AND THIS PICTURE OF HER PRESENT SUFFERINGS ACTED
AS A CURE OF EVERY FORMER UNGENEROUS SUSPICION, AND LEFT HER NOTHING
BUT PITY; AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE LESS JUST AND LESS GENTLE
SENSATIONS OF THE PAST, OBLIGED HER TO ADMIT THAT JANE MIGHT VERY
NATURALLY RESOLVE ON SEEING MRS. COLE OR ANY OTHER STEADY FRIEND,
WHEN SHE MIGHT NOT BEAR TO SEE HERSELF.  SHE SPOKE AS SHE FELT,
WITH EARNEST REGRET AND SOLICITUDE--SINCERELY WISHING THAT THE
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SHE COLLECTED FROM MISS BATES TO BE NOW ACTUALLY
DETERMINED ON, MIGHT BE AS MUCH FOR MISS FAIRFAX'S ADVANTAGE
AND COMFORT AS POSSIBLE.  "IT MUST BE A SEVERE TRIAL TO THEM ALL.
SHE HAD UNDERSTOOD IT WAS TO BE DELAYED TILL COLONEL CAMPBELL'S RETURN."

"SO VERY KIND!" REPLIED MISS BATES.  "BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS KIND."

THERE WAS NO BEARING SUCH AN "ALWAYS;" AND TO BREAK THROUGH HER
DREADFUL GRATITUDE, EMMA MADE THE DIRECT INQUIRY OF--

"WHERE--MAY I ASK?--IS MISS FAIRFAX GOING?"

"TO A MRS. SMALLRIDGE--CHARMING WOMAN--MOST SUPERIOR--TO HAVE
THE CHARGE OF HER THREE LITTLE GIRLS--DELIGHTFUL CHILDREN.
IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY SITUATION COULD BE MORE REPLETE WITH COMFORT;
IF WE EXCEPT, PERHAPS, MRS. SUCKLING'S OWN FAMILY, AND MRS. BRAGGE'S;
BUT MRS. SMALLRIDGE IS INTIMATE WITH BOTH, AND IN THE VERY
SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD:--LIVES ONLY FOUR MILES FROM MAPLE GROVE.
JANE WILL BE ONLY FOUR MILES FROM MAPLE GROVE."

"MRS. ELTON, I SUPPOSE, HAS BEEN THE PERSON TO WHOM MISS FAIRFAX OWES--"

"YES, OUR GOOD MRS. ELTON.  THE MOST INDEFATIGABLE, TRUE FRIEND.
SHE WOULD NOT TAKE A DENIAL.  SHE WOULD NOT LET JANE SAY, `NO;' FOR
WHEN JANE FIRST HEARD OF IT, (IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY,
THE VERY MORNING WE WERE AT DONWELL,) WHEN JANE FIRST HEARD OF IT,
SHE WAS QUITE DECIDED AGAINST ACCEPTING THE OFFER, AND FOR THE
REASONS YOU MENTION; EXACTLY AS YOU SAY, SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND
TO CLOSE WITH NOTHING TILL COLONEL CAMPBELL'S RETURN, AND NOTHING
SHOULD INDUCE HER TO ENTER INTO ANY ENGAGEMENT AT PRESENT--AND SO SHE
TOLD MRS. ELTON OVER AND OVER AGAIN--AND I AM SURE I HAD NO MORE
IDEA THAT SHE WOULD CHANGE HER MIND!--BUT THAT GOOD MRS. ELTON,
WHOSE JUDGMENT NEVER FAILS HER, SAW FARTHER THAN I DID.  IT IS NOT
EVERY BODY THAT WOULD HAVE STOOD OUT IN SUCH A KIND WAY AS SHE DID,
AND REFUSE TO TAKE JANE'S ANSWER; BUT SHE POSITIVELY DECLARED SHE
WOULD _NOT_ WRITE ANY SUCH DENIAL YESTERDAY, AS JANE WISHED HER;
SHE WOULD WAIT--AND, SURE ENOUGH, YESTERDAY EVENING IT WAS ALL
SETTLED THAT JANE SHOULD GO.  QUITE A SURPRIZE TO ME!  I HAD NOT
THE LEAST IDEA!--JANE TOOK MRS. ELTON ASIDE, AND TOLD HER AT ONCE,
THAT UPON THINKING OVER THE ADVANTAGES OF MRS. SMALLRIDGE'S SITUATION,
SHE HAD COME TO THE RESOLUTION OF ACCEPTING IT.--I DID NOT KNOW A WORD
OF IT TILL IT WAS ALL SETTLED."

"YOU SPENT THE EVENING WITH MRS. ELTON?"

"YES, ALL OF US; MRS. ELTON WOULD HAVE US COME.  IT WAS SETTLED SO,
UPON THE HILL, WHILE WE WERE WALKING ABOUT WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY.
`YOU _MUST_ _ALL_ SPEND YOUR EVENING WITH US,' SAID SHE--`I POSITIVELY MUST
HAVE YOU _ALL_ COME.'"

"MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS THERE TOO, WAS HE?"

"NO, NOT MR. KNIGHTLEY; HE DECLINED IT FROM THE FIRST; AND THOUGH I
THOUGHT HE WOULD COME, BECAUSE MRS. ELTON DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT LET
HIM OFF, HE DID NOT;--BUT MY MOTHER, AND JANE, AND I, WERE ALL THERE,
AND A VERY AGREEABLE EVENING WE HAD.  SUCH KIND FRIENDS, YOU KNOW,
MISS WOODHOUSE, ONE MUST ALWAYS FIND AGREEABLE, THOUGH EVERY BODY
SEEMED RATHER FAGGED AFTER THE MORNING'S PARTY.  EVEN PLEASURE,
YOU KNOW, IS FATIGUING--AND I CANNOT SAY THAT ANY OF THEM SEEMED
VERY MUCH TO HAVE ENJOYED IT.  HOWEVER, _I_ SHALL ALWAYS THINK IT
A VERY PLEASANT PARTY, AND FEEL EXTREMELY OBLIGED TO THE KIND FRIENDS
WHO INCLUDED ME IN IT."

"MISS FAIRFAX, I SUPPOSE, THOUGH YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF IT, HAD BEEN
MAKING UP HER MIND THE WHOLE DAY?"

"I DARE SAY SHE HAD."

"WHENEVER THE TIME MAY COME, IT MUST BE UNWELCOME TO HER AND ALL
HER FRIENDS--BUT I HOPE HER ENGAGEMENT WILL HAVE EVERY ALLEVIATION
THAT IS POSSIBLE--I MEAN, AS TO THE CHARACTER AND MANNERS OF THE FAMILY."

"THANK YOU, DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE.  YES, INDEED, THERE IS EVERY THING
IN THE WORLD THAT CAN MAKE HER HAPPY IN IT.  EXCEPT THE SUCKLINGS
AND BRAGGES, THERE IS NOT SUCH ANOTHER NURSERY ESTABLISHMENT,
SO LIBERAL AND ELEGANT, IN ALL MRS. ELTON'S ACQUAINTANCE.
MRS. SMALLRIDGE, A MOST DELIGHTFUL WOMAN!--A STYLE OF LIVING ALMOST
EQUAL TO MAPLE GROVE--AND AS TO THE CHILDREN, EXCEPT THE LITTLE
SUCKLINGS AND LITTLE BRAGGES, THERE ARE NOT SUCH ELEGANT SWEET
CHILDREN ANYWHERE.  JANE WILL BE TREATED WITH SUCH REGARD AND KINDNESS!--
IT WILL BE NOTHING BUT PLEASURE, A LIFE OF PLEASURE.--AND HER SALARY!--
I REALLY CANNOT VENTURE TO NAME HER SALARY TO YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE.
EVEN YOU, USED AS YOU ARE TO GREAT SUMS, WOULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT
SO MUCH COULD BE GIVEN TO A YOUNG PERSON LIKE JANE."

"AH! MADAM," CRIED EMMA, "IF OTHER CHILDREN ARE AT ALL LIKE WHAT I
REMEMBER TO HAVE BEEN MYSELF, I SHOULD THINK FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT
OF WHAT I HAVE EVER YET HEARD NAMED AS A SALARY ON SUCH OCCASIONS,
DEARLY EARNED."

"YOU ARE SO NOBLE IN YOUR IDEAS!"

"AND WHEN IS MISS FAIRFAX TO LEAVE YOU?"

"VERY SOON, VERY SOON, INDEED; THAT'S THE WORST OF IT.
WITHIN A FORTNIGHT.  MRS. SMALLRIDGE IS IN A GREAT HURRY.  MY POOR
MOTHER DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO BEAR IT.  SO THEN, I TRY TO PUT IT OUT OF
HER THOUGHTS, AND SAY, COME MA'AM, DO NOT LET US THINK ABOUT IT ANY MORE."

"HER FRIENDS MUST ALL BE SORRY TO LOSE HER; AND WILL NOT COLONEL
AND MRS. CAMPBELL BE SORRY TO FIND THAT SHE HAS ENGAGED HERSELF
BEFORE THEIR RETURN?"

"YES; JANE SAYS SHE IS SURE THEY WILL; BUT YET, THIS IS SUCH
A SITUATION AS SHE CANNOT FEEL HERSELF JUSTIFIED IN DECLINING.
I WAS SO ASTONISHED WHEN SHE FIRST TOLD ME WHAT SHE HAD BEEN SAYING
TO MRS. ELTON, AND WHEN MRS. ELTON AT THE SAME MOMENT CAME CONGRATULATING
ME UPON IT!  IT WAS BEFORE TEA--STAY--NO, IT COULD NOT BE BEFORE TEA,
BECAUSE WE WERE JUST GOING TO CARDS--AND YET IT WAS BEFORE TEA,
BECAUSE I REMEMBER THINKING--OH! NO, NOW I RECOLLECT, NOW I HAVE IT;
SOMETHING HAPPENED BEFORE TEA, BUT NOT THAT.  MR. ELTON WAS CALLED
OUT OF THE ROOM BEFORE TEA, OLD JOHN ABDY'S SON WANTED TO SPEAK
WITH HIM.  POOR OLD JOHN, I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM; HE WAS CLERK
TO MY POOR FATHER TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS; AND NOW, POOR OLD MAN, HE IS
BED-RIDDEN, AND VERY POORLY WITH THE RHEUMATIC GOUT IN HIS JOINTS--
I MUST GO AND SEE HIM TO-DAY; AND SO WILL JANE, I AM SURE, IF SHE
GETS OUT AT ALL.  AND POOR JOHN'S SON CAME TO TALK TO MR. ELTON
ABOUT RELIEF FROM THE PARISH; HE IS VERY WELL TO DO HIMSELF,
YOU KNOW, BEING HEAD MAN AT THE CROWN, OSTLER, AND EVERY THING
OF THAT SORT, BUT STILL HE CANNOT KEEP HIS FATHER WITHOUT SOME HELP;
AND SO, WHEN MR. ELTON CAME BACK, HE TOLD US WHAT JOHN OSTLER
HAD BEEN TELLING HIM, AND THEN IT CAME OUT ABOUT THE CHAISE HAVING
BEEN SENT TO RANDALLS TO TAKE MR. FRANK CHURCHILL TO RICHMOND.
THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE TEA.  IT WAS AFTER TEA THAT JANE SPOKE
TO MRS. ELTON."

MISS BATES WOULD HARDLY GIVE EMMA TIME TO SAY HOW PERFECTLY
NEW THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS TO HER; BUT AS WITHOUT SUPPOSING IT
POSSIBLE THAT SHE COULD BE IGNORANT OF ANY OF THE PARTICULARS
OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL'S GOING, SHE PROCEEDED TO GIVE THEM ALL,
IT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE.

WHAT MR. ELTON HAD LEARNED FROM THE OSTLER ON THE SUBJECT, BEING THE
ACCUMULATION OF THE OSTLER'S OWN KNOWLEDGE, AND THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE SERVANTS AT RANDALLS, WAS, THAT A MESSENGER HAD COME OVER
FROM RICHMOND SOON AFTER THE RETURN OF THE PARTY FROM BOX HILL--
WHICH MESSENGER, HOWEVER, HAD BEEN NO MORE THAN WAS EXPECTED;
AND THAT MR. CHURCHILL HAD SENT HIS NEPHEW A FEW LINES, CONTAINING,
UPON THE WHOLE, A TOLERABLE ACCOUNT OF MRS. CHURCHILL, AND ONLY
WISHING HIM NOT TO DELAY COMING BACK BEYOND THE NEXT MORNING EARLY;
BUT THAT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL HAVING RESOLVED TO GO HOME DIRECTLY,
WITHOUT WAITING AT ALL, AND HIS HORSE SEEMING TO HAVE GOT A COLD,
TOM HAD BEEN SENT OFF IMMEDIATELY FOR THE CROWN CHAISE, AND THE
OSTLER HAD STOOD OUT AND SEEN IT PASS BY, THE BOY GOING A GOOD PACE,
AND DRIVING VERY STEADY.

THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS EITHER TO ASTONISH OR INTEREST,
AND IT CAUGHT EMMA'S ATTENTION ONLY AS IT UNITED WITH THE SUBJECT
WHICH ALREADY ENGAGED HER MIND.  THE CONTRAST BETWEEN MRS. CHURCHILL'S
IMPORTANCE IN THE WORLD, AND JANE FAIRFAX'S, STRUCK HER; ONE WAS
EVERY THING, THE OTHER NOTHING--AND SHE SAT MUSING ON THE DIFFERENCE
OF WOMAN'S DESTINY, AND QUITE UNCONSCIOUS ON WHAT HER EYES WERE FIXED,
TILL ROUSED BY MISS BATES'S SAYING,

"AYE, I SEE WHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF, THE PIANOFORTE.  WHAT IS TO BECOME
OF THAT?--VERY TRUE.  POOR DEAR JANE WAS TALKING OF IT JUST NOW.--
`YOU MUST GO,' SAID SHE.  `YOU AND I MUST PART.  YOU WILL HAVE NO
BUSINESS HERE.--LET IT STAY, HOWEVER,' SAID SHE; `GIVE IT HOUSEROOM
TILL COLONEL CAMPBELL COMES BACK.  I SHALL TALK ABOUT IT TO HIM;
HE WILL SETTLE FOR ME; HE WILL HELP ME OUT OF ALL MY DIFFICULTIES.'--
AND TO THIS DAY, I DO BELIEVE, SHE KNOWS NOT WHETHER IT WAS HIS
PRESENT OR HIS DAUGHTER'S."

NOW EMMA WAS OBLIGED TO THINK OF THE PIANOFORTE; AND THE REMEMBRANCE
OF ALL HER FORMER FANCIFUL AND UNFAIR CONJECTURES WAS SO LITTLE PLEASING,
THAT SHE SOON ALLOWED HERSELF TO BELIEVE HER VISIT HAD BEEN
LONG ENOUGH; AND, WITH A REPETITION OF EVERY THING THAT SHE COULD
VENTURE TO SAY OF THE GOOD WISHES WHICH SHE REALLY FELT, TOOK LEAVE.



CHAPTER IX


EMMA'S PENSIVE MEDITATIONS, AS SHE WALKED HOME, WERE NOT INTERRUPTED;
BUT ON ENTERING THE PARLOUR, SHE FOUND THOSE WHO MUST ROUSE HER.
MR. KNIGHTLEY AND HARRIET HAD ARRIVED DURING HER ABSENCE, AND WERE
SITTING WITH HER FATHER.--MR. KNIGHTLEY IMMEDIATELY GOT UP, AND IN A
MANNER DECIDEDLY GRAVER THAN USUAL, SAID,

"I WOULD NOT GO AWAY WITHOUT SEEING YOU, BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO SPARE,
AND THEREFORE MUST NOW BE GONE DIRECTLY.  I AM GOING TO LONDON,
TO SPEND A FEW DAYS WITH JOHN AND ISABELLA.  HAVE YOU ANY THING TO
SEND OR SAY, BESIDES THE `LOVE,' WHICH NOBODY CARRIES?"

"NOTHING AT ALL.  BUT IS NOT THIS A SUDDEN SCHEME?"

"YES--RATHER--I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF IT SOME LITTLE TIME."

EMMA WAS SURE HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN HER; HE LOOKED UNLIKE HIMSELF.
TIME, HOWEVER, SHE THOUGHT, WOULD TELL HIM THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE
FRIENDS AGAIN.  WHILE HE STOOD, AS IF MEANING TO GO, BUT NOT GOING--
HER FATHER BEGAN HIS INQUIRIES.

"WELL, MY DEAR, AND DID YOU GET THERE SAFELY?--AND HOW DID YOU
FIND MY WORTHY OLD FRIEND AND HER DAUGHTER?--I DARE SAY THEY MUST
HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR COMING.  DEAR EMMA HAS BEEN
TO CALL ON MRS. AND MISS BATES, MR. KNIGHTLEY, AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE.
SHE IS ALWAYS SO ATTENTIVE TO THEM!"

EMMA'S COLOUR WAS HEIGHTENED BY THIS UNJUST PRAISE; AND WITH A SMILE,
AND SHAKE OF THE HEAD, WHICH SPOKE MUCH, SHE LOOKED AT MR. KNIGHTLEY.--
IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WERE AN INSTANTANEOUS IMPRESSION IN HER FAVOUR,
AS IF HIS EYES RECEIVED THE TRUTH FROM HER'S, AND ALL THAT HAD
PASSED OF GOOD IN HER FEELINGS WERE AT ONCE CAUGHT AND HONOURED.--
HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A GLOW OF REGARD.  SHE WAS WARMLY GRATIFIED--
AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT STILL MORE SO, BY A LITTLE MOVEMENT OF
MORE THAN COMMON FRIENDLINESS ON HIS PART.--HE TOOK HER HAND;--
WHETHER SHE HAD NOT HERSELF MADE THE FIRST MOTION, SHE COULD NOT SAY--
SHE MIGHT, PERHAPS, HAVE RATHER OFFERED IT--BUT HE TOOK HER HAND,
PRESSED IT, AND CERTAINLY WAS ON THE POINT OF CARRYING IT TO HIS LIPS--
WHEN, FROM SOME FANCY OR OTHER, HE SUDDENLY LET IT GO.--WHY HE SHOULD FEEL
SUCH A SCRUPLE, WHY HE SHOULD CHANGE HIS MIND WHEN IT WAS ALL BUT DONE,
SHE COULD NOT PERCEIVE.--HE WOULD HAVE JUDGED BETTER, SHE THOUGHT,
IF HE HAD NOT STOPPED.--THE INTENTION, HOWEVER, WAS INDUBITABLE;
AND WHETHER IT WAS THAT HIS MANNERS HAD IN GENERAL SO LITTLE GALLANTRY,
OR HOWEVER ELSE IT HAPPENED, BUT SHE THOUGHT NOTHING BECAME HIM MORE.--
IT WAS WITH HIM, OF SO SIMPLE, YET SO DIGNIFIED A NATURE.--
SHE COULD NOT BUT RECALL THE ATTEMPT WITH GREAT SATISFACTION.
IT SPOKE SUCH PERFECT AMITY.--HE LEFT THEM IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS--
GONE IN A MOMENT.  HE ALWAYS MOVED WITH THE ALERTNESS OF A MIND WHICH
COULD NEITHER BE UNDECIDED NOR DILATORY, BUT NOW HE SEEMED MORE SUDDEN
THAN USUAL IN HIS DISAPPEARANCE.

EMMA COULD NOT REGRET HER HAVING GONE TO MISS BATES, BUT SHE WISHED
SHE HAD LEFT HER TEN MINUTES EARLIER;--IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT
PLEASURE TO TALK OVER JANE FAIRFAX'S SITUATION WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY.--
NEITHER WOULD SHE REGRET THAT HE SHOULD BE GOING TO BRUNSWICK SQUARE,
FOR SHE KNEW HOW MUCH HIS VISIT WOULD BE ENJOYED--BUT IT MIGHT HAVE
HAPPENED AT A BETTER TIME--AND TO HAVE HAD LONGER NOTICE OF IT,
WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANTER.--THEY PARTED THOROUGH FRIENDS, HOWEVER;
SHE COULD NOT BE DECEIVED AS TO THE MEANING OF HIS COUNTENANCE,
AND HIS UNFINISHED GALLANTRY;--IT WAS ALL DONE TO ASSURE HER THAT SHE
HAD FULLY RECOVERED HIS GOOD OPINION.--HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH THEM
HALF AN HOUR, SHE FOUND.  IT WAS A PITY THAT SHE HAD NOT COME
BACK EARLIER!

IN THE HOPE OF DIVERTING HER FATHER'S THOUGHTS FROM THE DISAGREEABLENESS
OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S GOING TO LONDON; AND GOING SO SUDDENLY;
AND GOING ON HORSEBACK, WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ALL VERY BAD;
EMMA COMMUNICATED HER NEWS OF JANE FAIRFAX, AND HER DEPENDENCE
ON THE EFFECT WAS JUSTIFIED; IT SUPPLIED A VERY USEFUL CHECK,--
INTERESTED, WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM.  HE HAD LONG MADE UP HIS MIND TO JANE
FAIRFAX'S GOING OUT AS GOVERNESS, AND COULD TALK OF IT CHEERFULLY,
BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY'S GOING TO LONDON HAD BEEN AN UNEXPECTED BLOW.

"I AM VERY GLAD, INDEED, MY DEAR, TO HEAR SHE IS TO BE SO
COMFORTABLY SETTLED.  MRS. ELTON IS VERY GOOD-NATURED AND AGREEABLE,
AND I DARE SAY HER ACQUAINTANCE ARE JUST WHAT THEY OUGHT
TO BE.  I HOPE IT IS A DRY SITUATION, AND THAT HER HEALTH
WILL BE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF.  IT OUGHT TO BE A FIRST OBJECT,
AS I AM SURE POOR MISS TAYLOR'S ALWAYS WAS WITH ME.  YOU KNOW,
MY DEAR, SHE IS GOING TO BE TO THIS NEW LADY WHAT MISS TAYLOR
WAS TO US.  AND I HOPE SHE WILL BE BETTER OFF IN ONE RESPECT,
AND NOT BE INDUCED TO GO AWAY AFTER IT HAS BEEN HER HOME SO LONG."

THE FOLLOWING DAY BROUGHT NEWS FROM RICHMOND TO THROW EVERY
THING ELSE INTO THE BACKGROUND.  AN EXPRESS ARRIVED AT RANDALLS
TO ANNOUNCE THE DEATH OF MRS. CHURCHILL!  THOUGH HER NEPHEW
HAD HAD NO PARTICULAR REASON TO HASTEN BACK ON HER ACCOUNT,
SHE HAD NOT LIVED ABOVE SIX-AND-THIRTY HOURS AFTER HIS RETURN.
A SUDDEN SEIZURE OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM ANY THING FOREBODED
BY HER GENERAL STATE, HAD CARRIED HER OFF AFTER A SHORT STRUGGLE.
THE GREAT MRS. CHURCHILL WAS NO MORE.

IT WAS FELT AS SUCH THINGS MUST BE FELT.  EVERY BODY HAD A
DEGREE OF GRAVITY AND SORROW; TENDERNESS TOWARDS THE DEPARTED,
SOLICITUDE FOR THE SURVIVING FRIENDS; AND, IN A REASONABLE TIME,
CURIOSITY TO KNOW WHERE SHE WOULD BE BURIED.  GOLDSMITH TELLS US,
THAT WHEN LOVELY WOMAN STOOPS TO FOLLY, SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO
BUT TO DIE; AND WHEN SHE STOOPS TO BE DISAGREEABLE, IT IS EQUALLY
TO BE RECOMMENDED AS A CLEARER OF ILL-FAME. MRS. CHURCHILL,
AFTER BEING DISLIKED AT LEAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, WAS NOW SPOKEN OF
WITH COMPASSIONATE ALLOWANCES.  IN ONE POINT SHE WAS FULLY JUSTIFIED.
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ADMITTED BEFORE TO BE SERIOUSLY ILL.  THE EVENT
ACQUITTED HER OF ALL THE FANCIFULNESS, AND ALL THE SELFISHNESS
OF IMAGINARY COMPLAINTS.

"POOR MRS. CHURCHILL! NO DOUBT SHE HAD BEEN SUFFERING A GREAT DEAL:
MORE THAN ANY BODY HAD EVER SUPPOSED--AND CONTINUAL PAIN WOULD TRY
THE TEMPER.  IT WAS A SAD EVENT--A GREAT SHOCK--WITH ALL HER FAULTS,
WHAT WOULD MR. CHURCHILL DO WITHOUT HER?  MR. CHURCHILL'S LOSS
WOULD BE DREADFUL INDEED.  MR. CHURCHILL WOULD NEVER GET OVER IT."--
EVEN MR. WESTON SHOOK HIS HEAD, AND LOOKED SOLEMN, AND SAID,
"AH! POOR WOMAN, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT!" AND RESOLVED, THAT HIS
MOURNING SHOULD BE AS HANDSOME AS POSSIBLE; AND HIS WIFE SAT SIGHING
AND MORALISING OVER HER BROAD HEMS WITH A COMMISERATION AND GOOD SENSE,
TRUE AND STEADY.  HOW IT WOULD AFFECT FRANK WAS AMONG THE EARLIEST
THOUGHTS OF BOTH.  IT WAS ALSO A VERY EARLY SPECULATION WITH EMMA.
THE CHARACTER OF MRS. CHURCHILL, THE GRIEF OF HER HUSBAND--HER MIND
GLANCED OVER THEM BOTH WITH AWE AND COMPASSION--AND THEN RESTED
WITH LIGHTENED FEELINGS ON HOW FRANK MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THE EVENT,
HOW BENEFITED, HOW FREED.  SHE SAW IN A MOMENT ALL THE POSSIBLE GOOD.
NOW, AN ATTACHMENT TO HARRIET SMITH WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO ENCOUNTER.
MR. CHURCHILL, INDEPENDENT OF HIS WIFE, WAS FEARED BY NOBODY;
AN EASY, GUIDABLE MAN, TO BE PERSUADED INTO ANY THING BY HIS NEPHEW.
ALL THAT REMAINED TO BE WISHED WAS, THAT THE NEPHEW SHOULD FORM
THE ATTACHMENT, AS, WITH ALL HER GOODWILL IN THE CAUSE, EMMA COULD FEEL
NO CERTAINTY OF ITS BEING ALREADY FORMED.

HARRIET BEHAVED EXTREMELY WELL ON THE OCCASION, WITH GREAT SELF-COMMAND.
WHAT EVER SHE MIGHT FEEL OF BRIGHTER HOPE, SHE BETRAYED NOTHING.  EMMA WAS
GRATIFIED, TO OBSERVE SUCH A PROOF IN HER OF STRENGTHENED CHARACTER,
AND REFRAINED FROM ANY ALLUSION THAT MIGHT ENDANGER ITS MAINTENANCE.
THEY SPOKE, THEREFORE, OF MRS. CHURCHILL'S DEATH WITH MUTUAL FORBEARANCE.

SHORT LETTERS FROM FRANK WERE RECEIVED AT RANDALLS, COMMUNICATING
ALL THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY IMPORTANT OF THEIR STATE AND PLANS.
MR. CHURCHILL WAS BETTER THAN COULD BE EXPECTED; AND THEIR
FIRST REMOVAL, ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE FUNERAL FOR YORKSHIRE,
WAS TO BE TO THE HOUSE OF A VERY OLD FRIEND IN WINDSOR, TO WHOM
MR. CHURCHILL HAD BEEN PROMISING A VISIT THE LAST TEN YEARS.
AT PRESENT, THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE FOR HARRIET; GOOD WISHES
FOR THE FUTURE WERE ALL THAT COULD YET BE POSSIBLE ON EMMA'S SIDE.

IT WAS A MORE PRESSING CONCERN TO SHEW ATTENTION TO JANE FAIRFAX,
WHOSE PROSPECTS WERE CLOSING, WHILE HARRIET'S OPENED, AND WHOSE
ENGAGEMENTS NOW ALLOWED OF NO DELAY IN ANY ONE AT HIGHBURY, WHO WISHED
TO SHEW HER KINDNESS--AND WITH EMMA IT WAS GROWN INTO A FIRST WISH.
SHE HAD SCARCELY A STRONGER REGRET THAN FOR HER PAST COLDNESS;
AND THE PERSON, WHOM SHE HAD BEEN SO MANY MONTHS NEGLECTING, WAS NOW
THE VERY ONE ON WHOM SHE WOULD HAVE LAVISHED EVERY DISTINCTION OF
REGARD OR SYMPATHY.  SHE WANTED TO BE OF USE TO HER; WANTED TO SHEW
A VALUE FOR HER SOCIETY, AND TESTIFY RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION.
SHE RESOLVED TO PREVAIL ON HER TO SPEND A DAY AT HARTFIELD.
A NOTE WAS WRITTEN TO URGE IT.  THE INVITATION WAS REFUSED, AND BY
A VERBAL MESSAGE.  "MISS FAIRFAX WAS NOT WELL ENOUGH TO WRITE;"
AND WHEN MR. PERRY CALLED AT HARTFIELD, THE SAME MORNING,
IT APPEARED THAT SHE WAS SO MUCH INDISPOSED AS TO HAVE BEEN VISITED,
THOUGH AGAINST HER OWN CONSENT, BY HIMSELF, AND THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING
UNDER SEVERE HEADACHES, AND A NERVOUS FEVER TO A DEGREE, WHICH MADE
HIM DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF HER GOING TO MRS. SMALLRIDGE'S AT THE
TIME PROPOSED.  HER HEALTH SEEMED FOR THE MOMENT COMPLETELY DERANGED--
APPETITE QUITE GONE--AND THOUGH THERE WERE NO ABSOLUTELY
ALARMING SYMPTOMS, NOTHING TOUCHING THE PULMONARY COMPLAINT,
WHICH WAS THE STANDING APPREHENSION OF THE FAMILY, MR. PERRY WAS
UNEASY ABOUT HER.  HE THOUGHT SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN MORE THAN SHE
WAS EQUAL TO, AND THAT SHE FELT IT SO HERSELF, THOUGH SHE WOULD
NOT OWN IT.  HER SPIRITS SEEMED OVERCOME.  HER PRESENT HOME,
HE COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE, WAS UNFAVOURABLE TO A NERVOUS DISORDER:--
CONFINED ALWAYS TO ONE ROOM;--HE COULD HAVE WISHED IT OTHERWISE--
AND HER GOOD AUNT, THOUGH HIS VERY OLD FRIEND, HE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE
TO BE NOT THE BEST COMPANION FOR AN INVALID OF THAT DESCRIPTION.
HER CARE AND ATTENTION COULD NOT BE QUESTIONED; THEY WERE, IN FACT,
ONLY TOO GREAT.  HE VERY MUCH FEARED THAT MISS FAIRFAX DERIVED MORE
EVIL THAN GOOD FROM THEM.  EMMA LISTENED WITH THE WARMEST CONCERN;
GRIEVED FOR HER MORE AND MORE, AND LOOKED AROUND EAGER TO DISCOVER
SOME WAY OF BEING USEFUL.  TO TAKE HER--BE IT ONLY AN HOUR
OR TWO--FROM HER AUNT, TO GIVE HER CHANGE OF AIR AND SCENE,
AND QUIET RATIONAL CONVERSATION, EVEN FOR AN HOUR OR TWO,
MIGHT DO HER GOOD; AND THE FOLLOWING MORNING SHE WROTE AGAIN TO SAY,
IN THE MOST FEELING LANGUAGE SHE COULD COMMAND, THAT SHE WOULD
CALL FOR HER IN THE CARRIAGE AT ANY HOUR THAT JANE WOULD NAME--
MENTIONING THAT SHE HAD MR. PERRY'S DECIDED OPINION, IN FAVOUR
OF SUCH EXERCISE FOR HIS PATIENT.  THE ANSWER WAS ONLY IN THIS
SHORT NOTE:

"MISS FAIRFAX'S COMPLIMENTS AND THANKS, BUT IS QUITE UNEQUAL
TO ANY EXERCISE."

EMMA FELT THAT HER OWN NOTE HAD DESERVED SOMETHING BETTER; BUT IT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO QUARREL WITH WORDS, WHOSE TREMULOUS INEQUALITY
SHEWED INDISPOSITION SO PLAINLY, AND SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF HOW SHE
MIGHT BEST COUNTERACT THIS UNWILLINGNESS TO BE SEEN OR ASSISTED.
IN SPITE OF THE ANSWER, THEREFORE, SHE ORDERED THE CARRIAGE, AND DROVE
TO MRS. BATES'S, IN THE HOPE THAT JANE WOULD BE INDUCED TO JOIN HER--
BUT IT WOULD NOT DO;--MISS BATES CAME TO THE CARRIAGE DOOR, ALL GRATITUDE,
AND AGREEING WITH HER MOST EARNESTLY IN THINKING AN AIRING MIGHT BE OF
THE GREATEST SERVICE--AND EVERY THING THAT MESSAGE COULD DO WAS TRIED--
BUT ALL IN VAIN.  MISS BATES WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN WITHOUT SUCCESS;
JANE WAS QUITE UNPERSUADABLE; THE MERE PROPOSAL OF GOING OUT
SEEMED TO MAKE HER WORSE.--EMMA WISHED SHE COULD HAVE SEEN HER,
AND TRIED HER OWN POWERS; BUT, ALMOST BEFORE SHE COULD HINT THE WISH,
MISS BATES MADE IT APPEAR THAT SHE HAD PROMISED HER NIECE ON
NO ACCOUNT TO LET MISS WOODHOUSE IN.  "INDEED, THE TRUTH WAS,
THAT POOR DEAR JANE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE ANY BODY--ANY BODY AT ALL--
MRS. ELTON, INDEED, COULD NOT BE DENIED--AND MRS. COLE HAD MADE
SUCH A POINT--AND MRS. PERRY HAD SAID SO MUCH--BUT, EXCEPT THEM,
JANE WOULD REALLY SEE NOBODY."

EMMA DID NOT WANT TO BE CLASSED WITH THE MRS. ELTONS, THE MRS. PERRYS,
AND THE MRS. COLES, WHO WOULD FORCE THEMSELVES ANYWHERE;
NEITHER COULD SHE FEEL ANY RIGHT OF PREFERENCE HERSELF--
SHE SUBMITTED, THEREFORE, AND ONLY QUESTIONED MISS BATES FARTHER
AS TO HER NIECE'S APPETITE AND DIET, WHICH SHE LONGED TO BE ABLE
TO ASSIST.  ON THAT SUBJECT POOR MISS BATES WAS VERY UNHAPPY,
AND VERY COMMUNICATIVE; JANE WOULD HARDLY EAT ANY THING:--
MR. PERRY RECOMMENDED NOURISHING FOOD; BUT EVERY THING THEY COULD
COMMAND (AND NEVER HAD ANY BODY SUCH GOOD NEIGHBOURS) WAS DISTASTEFUL.

EMMA, ON REACHING HOME, CALLED THE HOUSEKEEPER DIRECTLY, TO AN
EXAMINATION OF HER STORES; AND SOME ARROWROOT OF VERY SUPERIOR QUALITY
WAS SPEEDILY DESPATCHED TO MISS BATES WITH A MOST FRIENDLY NOTE.
IN HALF AN HOUR THE ARROWROOT WAS RETURNED, WITH A THOUSAND THANKS
FROM MISS BATES, BUT "DEAR JANE WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT ITS
BEING SENT BACK; IT WAS A THING SHE COULD NOT TAKE--AND, MOREOVER,
SHE INSISTED ON HER SAYING, THAT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL IN WANT OF ANY THING."

WHEN EMMA AFTERWARDS HEARD THAT JANE FAIRFAX HAD BEEN SEEN WANDERING
ABOUT THE MEADOWS, AT SOME DISTANCE FROM HIGHBURY, ON THE AFTERNOON
OF THE VERY DAY ON WHICH SHE HAD, UNDER THE PLEA OF BEING UNEQUAL
TO ANY EXERCISE, SO PEREMPTORILY REFUSED TO GO OUT WITH HER IN
THE CARRIAGE, SHE COULD HAVE NO DOUBT--PUTTING EVERY THING TOGETHER--
THAT JANE WAS RESOLVED TO RECEIVE NO KINDNESS FROM _HER_.  SHE WAS SORRY,
VERY SORRY.  HER HEART WAS GRIEVED FOR A STATE WHICH SEEMED
BUT THE MORE PITIABLE FROM THIS SORT OF IRRITATION OF SPIRITS,
INCONSISTENCY OF ACTION, AND INEQUALITY OF POWERS; AND IT MORTIFIED
HER THAT SHE WAS GIVEN SO LITTLE CREDIT FOR PROPER FEELING, OR ESTEEMED
SO LITTLE WORTHY AS A FRIEND:  BUT SHE HAD THE CONSOLATION OF KNOWING
THAT HER INTENTIONS WERE GOOD, AND OF BEING ABLE TO SAY TO HERSELF,
THAT COULD MR. KNIGHTLEY HAVE BEEN PRIVY TO ALL HER ATTEMPTS
OF ASSISTING JANE FAIRFAX, COULD HE EVEN HAVE SEEN INTO HER HEART,
HE WOULD NOT, ON THIS OCCASION, HAVE FOUND ANY THING TO REPROVE.



CHAPTER X


ONE MORNING, ABOUT TEN DAYS AFTER MRS. CHURCHILL'S DECEASE,
EMMA WAS CALLED DOWNSTAIRS TO MR. WESTON, WHO "COULD NOT STAY
FIVE MINUTES, AND WANTED PARTICULARLY TO SPEAK WITH HER."--
HE MET HER AT THE PARLOUR-DOOR, AND HARDLY ASKING HER HOW SHE DID,
IN THE NATURAL KEY OF HIS VOICE, SUNK IT IMMEDIATELY, TO SAY,
UNHEARD BY HER FATHER,

"CAN YOU COME TO RANDALLS AT ANY TIME THIS MORNING?--DO, IF IT
BE POSSIBLE.  MRS. WESTON WANTS TO SEE YOU.  SHE MUST SEE YOU."

"IS SHE UNWELL?"

"NO, NO, NOT AT ALL--ONLY A LITTLE AGITATED.  SHE WOULD HAVE
ORDERED THE CARRIAGE, AND COME TO YOU, BUT SHE MUST SEE YOU _ALONE_,
AND THAT YOU KNOW--(NODDING TOWARDS HER FATHER)--HUMPH!--CAN YOU COME?"

"CERTAINLY.  THIS MOMENT, IF YOU PLEASE.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO
REFUSE WHAT YOU ASK IN SUCH A WAY.  BUT WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER?--
IS SHE REALLY NOT ILL?"

"DEPEND UPON ME--BUT ASK NO MORE QUESTIONS.  YOU WILL KNOW IT
ALL IN TIME.  THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE BUSINESS!  BUT HUSH, HUSH!"

TO GUESS WHAT ALL THIS MEANT, WAS IMPOSSIBLE EVEN FOR EMMA.
SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT SEEMED ANNOUNCED BY HIS LOOKS;
BUT, AS HER FRIEND WAS WELL, SHE ENDEAVOURED NOT TO BE UNEASY,
AND SETTLING IT WITH HER FATHER, THAT SHE WOULD TAKE HER WALK NOW,
SHE AND MR. WESTON WERE SOON OUT OF THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND ON
THEIR WAY AT A QUICK PACE FOR RANDALLS.

"NOW,"--SAID EMMA, WHEN THEY WERE FAIRLY BEYOND THE SWEEP GATES,--
"NOW MR. WESTON, DO LET ME KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED."

"NO, NO,"--HE GRAVELY REPLIED.--"DON'T ASK ME.  I PROMISED MY WIFE
TO LEAVE IT ALL TO HER.  SHE WILL BREAK IT TO YOU BETTER THAN I CAN.
DO NOT BE IMPATIENT, EMMA; IT WILL ALL COME OUT TOO SOON."

"BREAK IT TO ME," CRIED EMMA, STANDING STILL WITH TERROR.--
"GOOD GOD!--MR. WESTON, TELL ME AT ONCE.--SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
IN BRUNSWICK SQUARE.  I KNOW IT HAS.  TELL ME, I CHARGE YOU TELL
ME THIS MOMENT WHAT IT IS."

"NO, INDEED YOU ARE MISTAKEN."--

"MR. WESTON DO NOT TRIFLE WITH ME.--CONSIDER HOW MANY OF MY DEAREST
FRIENDS ARE NOW IN BRUNSWICK SQUARE.  WHICH OF THEM IS IT?--
I CHARGE YOU BY ALL THAT IS SACRED, NOT TO ATTEMPT CONCEALMENT."

"UPON MY WORD, EMMA."--

"YOUR WORD!--WHY NOT YOUR HONOUR!--WHY NOT SAY UPON YOUR HONOUR,
THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF THEM?  GOOD HEAVENS!--WHAT CAN
BE TO BE _BROKE_ TO ME, THAT DOES NOT RELATE TO ONE OF THAT FAMILY?"

"UPON MY HONOUR," SAID HE VERY SERIOUSLY, "IT DOES NOT.  IT IS NOT
IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE CONNECTED WITH ANY HUMAN BEING OF THE NAME
OF KNIGHTLEY."

EMMA'S COURAGE RETURNED, AND SHE WALKED ON.

"I WAS WRONG," HE CONTINUED, "IN TALKING OF ITS BEING _BROKE_ TO YOU.
I SHOULD NOT HAVE USED THE EXPRESSION.  IN FACT, IT DOES NOT CONCERN YOU--
IT CONCERNS ONLY MYSELF,--THAT IS, WE HOPE.--HUMPH!--IN SHORT,
MY DEAR EMMA, THERE IS NO OCCASION TO BE SO UNEASY ABOUT IT.
I DON'T SAY THAT IT IS NOT A DISAGREEABLE BUSINESS--BUT THINGS MIGHT
BE MUCH WORSE.--IF WE WALK FAST, WE SHALL SOON BE AT RANDALLS."

EMMA FOUND THAT SHE MUST WAIT; AND NOW IT REQUIRED LITTLE EFFORT.
SHE ASKED NO MORE QUESTIONS THEREFORE, MERELY EMPLOYED HER OWN FANCY,
AND THAT SOON POINTED OUT TO HER THE PROBABILITY OF ITS BEING SOME
MONEY CONCERN--SOMETHING JUST COME TO LIGHT, OF A DISAGREEABLE
NATURE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FAMILY,--SOMETHING WHICH THE LATE
EVENT AT RICHMOND HAD BROUGHT FORWARD.  HER FANCY WAS VERY ACTIVE.
HALF A DOZEN NATURAL CHILDREN, PERHAPS--AND POOR FRANK CUT OFF!--
THIS, THOUGH VERY UNDESIRABLE, WOULD BE NO MATTER OF AGONY TO HER.
IT INSPIRED LITTLE MORE THAN AN ANIMATING CURIOSITY.

"WHO IS THAT GENTLEMAN ON HORSEBACK?" SAID SHE, AS THEY PROCEEDED--
SPEAKING MORE TO ASSIST MR. WESTON IN KEEPING HIS SECRET, THAN WITH
ANY OTHER VIEW.

"I DO NOT KNOW.--ONE OF THE OTWAYS.--NOT FRANK;--IT IS NOT FRANK,
I ASSURE YOU.  YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM.  HE IS HALF WAY TO WINDSOR
BY THIS TIME."

"HAS YOUR SON BEEN WITH YOU, THEN?"

"OH! YES--DID NOT YOU KNOW?--WELL, WELL, NEVER MIND."

FOR A MOMENT HE WAS SILENT; AND THEN ADDED, IN A TONE MUCH MORE
GUARDED AND DEMURE,

"YES, FRANK CAME OVER THIS MORNING, JUST TO ASK US HOW WE DID."

THEY HURRIED ON, AND WERE SPEEDILY AT RANDALLS.--"WELL, MY DEAR,"
SAID HE, AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM--"I HAVE BROUGHT HER, AND NOW
I HOPE YOU WILL SOON BE BETTER.  I SHALL LEAVE YOU TOGETHER.
THERE IS NO USE IN DELAY.  I SHALL NOT BE FAR OFF, IF YOU WANT ME."--
AND EMMA DISTINCTLY HEARD HIM ADD, IN A LOWER TONE, BEFORE HE
QUITTED THE ROOM,--"I HAVE BEEN AS GOOD AS MY WORD.  SHE HAS NOT THE
LEAST IDEA."

MRS. WESTON WAS LOOKING SO ILL, AND HAD AN AIR OF SO MUCH PERTURBATION,
THAT EMMA'S UNEASINESS INCREASED; AND THE MOMENT THEY WERE ALONE,
SHE EAGERLY SAID,

"WHAT IS IT MY DEAR FRIEND?  SOMETHING OF A VERY UNPLEASANT NATURE,
I FIND, HAS OCCURRED;--DO LET ME KNOW DIRECTLY WHAT IT IS.
I HAVE BEEN WALKING ALL THIS WAY IN COMPLETE SUSPENSE.  WE BOTH
ABHOR SUSPENSE.  DO NOT LET MINE CONTINUE LONGER.  IT WILL DO YOU
GOOD TO SPEAK OF YOUR DISTRESS, WHATEVER IT MAY BE."

"HAVE YOU INDEED NO IDEA?" SAID MRS. WESTON IN A TREMBLING VOICE.
"CANNOT YOU, MY DEAR EMMA--CANNOT YOU FORM A GUESS AS TO WHAT YOU
ARE TO HEAR?"

"SO FAR AS THAT IT RELATES TO MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, I DO GUESS."

"YOU ARE RIGHT.  IT DOES RELATE TO HIM, AND I WILL TELL YOU DIRECTLY;"
(RESUMING HER WORK, AND SEEMING RESOLVED AGAINST LOOKING UP.)
"HE HAS BEEN HERE THIS VERY MORNING, ON A MOST EXTRAORDINARY ERRAND.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS OUR SURPRIZE.  HE CAME TO SPEAK TO HIS
FATHER ON A SUBJECT,--TO ANNOUNCE AN ATTACHMENT--"

SHE STOPPED TO BREATHE.  EMMA THOUGHT FIRST OF HERSELF, AND THEN
OF HARRIET.

"MORE THAN AN ATTACHMENT, INDEED," RESUMED MRS. WESTON; "AN ENGAGEMENT--
A POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT.--WHAT WILL YOU SAY, EMMA--WHAT WILL ANY
BODY SAY, WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS FAIRFAX
ARE ENGAGED;--NAY, THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LONG ENGAGED!"

EMMA EVEN JUMPED WITH SURPRIZE;--AND, HORROR-STRUCK, EXCLAIMED,

"JANE FAIRFAX!--GOOD GOD!  YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS?  YOU DO NOT MEAN IT?"

"YOU MAY WELL BE AMAZED," RETURNED MRS. WESTON, STILL AVERTING HER EYES,
AND TALKING ON WITH EAGERNESS, THAT EMMA MIGHT HAVE TIME TO RECOVER--
"YOU MAY WELL BE AMAZED.  BUT IT IS EVEN SO.  THERE HAS BEEN A SOLEMN
ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THEM EVER SINCE OCTOBER--FORMED AT WEYMOUTH,
AND KEPT A SECRET FROM EVERY BODY.  NOT A CREATURE KNOWING IT
BUT THEMSELVES--NEITHER THE CAMPBELLS, NOR HER FAMILY, NOR HIS.--
IT IS SO WONDERFUL, THAT THOUGH PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF THE FACT,
IT IS YET ALMOST INCREDIBLE TO MYSELF.  I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT.--
I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM."

EMMA SCARCELY HEARD WHAT WAS SAID.--HER MIND WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN
TWO IDEAS--HER OWN FORMER CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM ABOUT MISS FAIRFAX;
AND POOR HARRIET;--AND FOR SOME TIME SHE COULD ONLY EXCLAIM,
AND REQUIRE CONFIRMATION, REPEATED CONFIRMATION.

"WELL," SAID SHE AT LAST, TRYING TO RECOVER HERSELF; "THIS IS A
CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH I MUST THINK OF AT LEAST HALF A DAY, BEFORE I
CAN AT ALL COMPREHEND IT.  WHAT!--ENGAGED TO HER ALL THE WINTER--
BEFORE EITHER OF THEM CAME TO HIGHBURY?"

"ENGAGED SINCE OCTOBER,--SECRETLY ENGAGED.--IT HAS HURT ME,
EMMA, VERY MUCH.  IT HAS HURT HIS FATHER EQUALLY.  _SOME_ _PART_
OF HIS CONDUCT WE CANNOT EXCUSE."

EMMA PONDERED A MOMENT, AND THEN REPLIED, "I WILL NOT PRETEND
_NOT_ TO UNDERSTAND YOU; AND TO GIVE YOU ALL THE RELIEF IN MY POWER,
BE ASSURED THAT NO SUCH EFFECT HAS FOLLOWED HIS ATTENTIONS TO ME,
AS YOU ARE APPREHENSIVE OF."

MRS. WESTON LOOKED UP, AFRAID TO BELIEVE; BUT EMMA'S COUNTENANCE
WAS AS STEADY AS HER WORDS.

"THAT YOU MAY HAVE LESS DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING THIS BOAST, OF MY
PRESENT PERFECT INDIFFERENCE," SHE CONTINUED, "I WILL FARTHER TELL YOU,
THAT THERE WAS A PERIOD IN THE EARLY PART OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE,
WHEN I DID LIKE HIM, WHEN I WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO BE
ATTACHED TO HIM--NAY, WAS ATTACHED--AND HOW IT CAME TO CEASE,
IS PERHAPS THE WONDER.  FORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, IT DID CEASE.
I HAVE REALLY FOR SOME TIME PAST, FOR AT LEAST THESE THREE MONTHS,
CARED NOTHING ABOUT HIM.  YOU MAY BELIEVE ME, MRS. WESTON.
THIS IS THE SIMPLE TRUTH."

MRS. WESTON KISSED HER WITH TEARS OF JOY; AND WHEN SHE COULD
FIND UTTERANCE, ASSURED HER, THAT THIS PROTESTATION HAD DONE
HER MORE GOOD THAN ANY THING ELSE IN THE WORLD COULD DO.

"MR. WESTON WILL BE ALMOST AS MUCH RELIEVED AS MYSELF," SAID SHE.
"ON THIS POINT WE HAVE BEEN WRETCHED.  IT WAS OUR DARLING WISH THAT YOU
MIGHT BE ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER--AND WE WERE PERSUADED THAT IT WAS SO.--
IMAGINE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN FEELING ON YOUR ACCOUNT."

"I HAVE ESCAPED; AND THAT I SHOULD ESCAPE, MAY BE A MATTER OF
GRATEFUL WONDER TO YOU AND MYSELF.  BUT THIS DOES NOT ACQUIT _HIM_,
MRS. WESTON; AND I MUST SAY, THAT I THINK HIM GREATLY TO BLAME.
WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO COME AMONG US WITH AFFECTION AND FAITH ENGAGED,
AND WITH MANNERS SO _VERY_ DISENGAGED?  WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO ENDEAVOUR
TO PLEASE, AS HE CERTAINLY DID--TO DISTINGUISH ANY ONE YOUNG WOMAN WITH
PERSEVERING ATTENTION, AS HE CERTAINLY DID--WHILE HE REALLY BELONGED
TO ANOTHER?--HOW COULD HE TELL WHAT MISCHIEF HE MIGHT BE DOING?--
HOW COULD HE TELL THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE MAKING ME IN LOVE WITH HIM?--
VERY WRONG, VERY WRONG INDEED."

"FROM SOMETHING THAT HE SAID, MY DEAR EMMA, I RATHER IMAGINE--"

"AND HOW COULD _SHE_ BEAR SUCH BEHAVIOUR!  COMPOSURE WITH A WITNESS!
TO LOOK ON, WHILE REPEATED ATTENTIONS WERE OFFERING TO ANOTHER WOMAN,
BEFORE HER FACE, AND NOT RESENT IT.--THAT IS A DEGREE OF PLACIDITY,
WHICH I CAN NEITHER COMPREHEND NOR RESPECT."

"THERE WERE MISUNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN THEM, EMMA; HE SAID
SO EXPRESSLY.  HE HAD NOT TIME TO ENTER INTO MUCH EXPLANATION.
HE WAS HERE ONLY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, AND IN A STATE OF AGITATION
WHICH DID NOT ALLOW THE FULL USE EVEN OF THE TIME HE COULD STAY--
BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN MISUNDERSTANDINGS HE DECIDEDLY SAID.
THE PRESENT CRISIS, INDEED, SEEMED TO BE BROUGHT ON BY THEM;
AND THOSE MISUNDERSTANDINGS MIGHT VERY POSSIBLY ARISE FROM THE
IMPROPRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT."

"IMPROPRIETY!  OH!  MRS. WESTON--IT IS TOO CALM A CENSURE.
MUCH, MUCH BEYOND IMPROPRIETY!--IT HAS SUNK HIM, I CANNOT SAY HOW
IT HAS SUNK HIM IN MY OPINION.  SO UNLIKE WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE!--
NONE OF THAT UPRIGHT INTEGRITY, THAT STRICT ADHERENCE TO TRUTH
AND PRINCIPLE, THAT DISDAIN OF TRICK AND LITTLENESS, WHICH A MAN
SHOULD DISPLAY IN EVERY TRANSACTION OF HIS LIFE."

"NAY, DEAR EMMA, NOW I MUST TAKE HIS PART; FOR THOUGH HE HAS BEEN
WRONG IN THIS INSTANCE, I HAVE KNOWN HIM LONG ENOUGH TO ANSWER
FOR HIS HAVING MANY, VERY MANY, GOOD QUALITIES; AND--"

"GOOD GOD!" CRIED EMMA, NOT ATTENDING TO HER.--"MRS. SMALLRIDGE, TOO!
JANE ACTUALLY ON THE POINT OF GOING AS GOVERNESS!  WHAT COULD HE
MEAN BY SUCH HORRIBLE INDELICACY?  TO SUFFER HER TO ENGAGE HERSELF--
TO SUFFER HER EVEN TO THINK OF SUCH A MEASURE!"

"HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT, EMMA.  ON THIS ARTICLE I CAN FULLY
ACQUIT HIM.  IT WAS A PRIVATE RESOLUTION OF HERS, NOT COMMUNICATED
TO HIM--OR AT LEAST NOT COMMUNICATED IN A WAY TO CARRY CONVICTION.--
TILL YESTERDAY, I KNOW HE SAID HE WAS IN THE DARK AS TO HER PLANS.
THEY BURST ON HIM, I DO NOT KNOW HOW, BUT BY SOME LETTER OR MESSAGE--
AND IT WAS THE DISCOVERY OF WHAT SHE WAS DOING, OF THIS VERY PROJECT
OF HERS, WHICH DETERMINED HIM TO COME FORWARD AT ONCE, OWN IT
ALL TO HIS UNCLE, THROW HIMSELF ON HIS KINDNESS, AND, IN SHORT,
PUT AN END TO THE MISERABLE STATE OF CONCEALMENT THAT HAD BEEN
CARRYING ON SO LONG."

EMMA BEGAN TO LISTEN BETTER.

"I AM TO HEAR FROM HIM SOON," CONTINUED MRS. WESTON.  "HE TOLD ME
AT PARTING, THAT HE SHOULD SOON WRITE; AND HE SPOKE IN A MANNER WHICH
SEEMED TO PROMISE ME MANY PARTICULARS THAT COULD NOT BE GIVEN NOW.
LET US WAIT, THEREFORE, FOR THIS LETTER.  IT MAY BRING MANY EXTENUATIONS.
IT MAY MAKE MANY THINGS INTELLIGIBLE AND EXCUSABLE WHICH NOW ARE
NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD.  DON'T LET US BE SEVERE, DON'T LET US BE IN
A HURRY TO CONDEMN HIM.  LET US HAVE PATIENCE.  I MUST LOVE HIM;
AND NOW THAT I AM SATISFIED ON ONE POINT, THE ONE MATERIAL POINT,
I AM SINCERELY ANXIOUS FOR ITS ALL TURNING OUT WELL, AND READY
TO HOPE THAT IT MAY.  THEY MUST BOTH HAVE SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL
UNDER SUCH A SYSTEM OF SECRESY AND CONCEALMENT."

"_HIS_ SUFFERINGS," REPLIED EMMA DRYLY, "DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE DONE
HIM MUCH HARM.  WELL, AND HOW DID MR. CHURCHILL TAKE IT?"

"MOST FAVOURABLY FOR HIS NEPHEW--GAVE HIS CONSENT WITH SCARCELY
A DIFFICULTY.  CONCEIVE WHAT THE EVENTS OF A WEEK HAVE DONE
IN THAT FAMILY!  WHILE POOR MRS. CHURCHILL LIVED, I SUPPOSE THERE
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A HOPE, A CHANCE, A POSSIBILITY;--BUT SCARCELY
ARE HER REMAINS AT REST IN THE FAMILY VAULT, THAN HER HUSBAND IS
PERSUADED TO ACT EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE REQUIRED.
WHAT A BLESSING IT IS, WHEN UNDUE INFLUENCE DOES NOT SURVIVE THE GRAVE!--
HE GAVE HIS CONSENT WITH VERY LITTLE PERSUASION."

"AH!" THOUGHT EMMA, "HE WOULD HAVE DONE AS MUCH FOR HARRIET."

"THIS WAS SETTLED LAST NIGHT, AND FRANK WAS OFF WITH THE LIGHT
THIS MORNING.  HE STOPPED AT HIGHBURY, AT THE BATES'S, I FANCY,
SOME TIME--AND THEN CAME ON HITHER; BUT WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO GET
BACK TO HIS UNCLE, TO WHOM HE IS JUST NOW MORE NECESSARY THAN EVER,
THAT, AS I TELL YOU, HE COULD STAY WITH US BUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR.--
HE WAS VERY MUCH AGITATED--VERY MUCH, INDEED--TO A DEGREE THAT MADE
HIM APPEAR QUITE A DIFFERENT CREATURE FROM ANY THING I HAD EVER SEEN
HIM BEFORE.--IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST, THERE HAD BEEN THE SHOCK OF
FINDING HER SO VERY UNWELL, WHICH HE HAD HAD NO PREVIOUS SUSPICION OF--
AND THERE WAS EVERY APPEARANCE OF HIS HAVING BEEN FEELING A GREAT DEAL."

"AND DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THE AFFAIR TO HAVE BEEN CARRYING ON
WITH SUCH PERFECT SECRESY?--THE CAMPBELLS, THE DIXONS, DID NONE
OF THEM KNOW OF THE ENGAGEMENT?"

EMMA COULD NOT SPEAK THE NAME OF DIXON WITHOUT A LITTLE BLUSH.

"NONE; NOT ONE.  HE POSITIVELY SAID THAT IT HAD BEEN KNOWN TO NO
BEING IN THE WORLD BUT THEIR TWO SELVES."

"WELL," SAID EMMA, "I SUPPOSE WE SHALL GRADUALLY GROW RECONCILED
TO THE IDEA, AND I WISH THEM VERY HAPPY.  BUT I SHALL ALWAYS
THINK IT A VERY ABOMINABLE SORT OF PROCEEDING.  WHAT HAS IT BEEN
BUT A SYSTEM OF HYPOCRISY AND DECEIT,--ESPIONAGE, AND TREACHERY?--
TO COME AMONG US WITH PROFESSIONS OF OPENNESS AND SIMPLICITY;
AND SUCH A LEAGUE IN SECRET TO JUDGE US ALL!--HERE HAVE WE BEEN,
THE WHOLE WINTER AND SPRING, COMPLETELY DUPED, FANCYING OURSELVES
ALL ON AN EQUAL FOOTING OF TRUTH AND HONOUR, WITH TWO PEOPLE IN THE
MIDST OF US WHO MAY HAVE BEEN CARRYING ROUND, COMPARING AND SITTING
IN JUDGMENT ON SENTIMENTS AND WORDS THAT WERE NEVER MEANT FOR BOTH
TO HEAR.--THEY MUST TAKE THE CONSEQUENCE, IF THEY HAVE HEARD EACH
OTHER SPOKEN OF IN A WAY NOT PERFECTLY AGREEABLE!"

"I AM QUITE EASY ON THAT HEAD," REPLIED MRS. WESTON.  "I AM
VERY SURE THAT I NEVER SAID ANY THING OF EITHER TO THE OTHER,
WHICH BOTH MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD."

"YOU ARE IN LUCK.--YOUR ONLY BLUNDER WAS CONFINED TO MY EAR,
WHEN YOU IMAGINED A CERTAIN FRIEND OF OURS IN LOVE WITH THE LADY."

"TRUE.  BUT AS I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A THOROUGHLY GOOD OPINION OF MISS
FAIRFAX, I NEVER COULD, UNDER ANY BLUNDER, HAVE SPOKEN ILL OF HER;
AND AS TO SPEAKING ILL OF HIM, THERE I MUST HAVE BEEN SAFE."

AT THIS MOMENT MR. WESTON APPEARED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE WINDOW,
EVIDENTLY ON THE WATCH.  HIS WIFE GAVE HIM A LOOK WHICH INVITED
HIM IN; AND, WHILE HE WAS COMING ROUND, ADDED, "NOW, DEAREST EMMA,
LET ME INTREAT YOU TO SAY AND LOOK EVERY THING THAT MAY SET HIS
HEART AT EASE, AND INCLINE HIM TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE MATCH.
LET US MAKE THE BEST OF IT--AND, INDEED, ALMOST EVERY THING MAY
BE FAIRLY SAID IN HER FAVOUR.  IT IS NOT A CONNEXION TO GRATIFY;
BUT IF MR. CHURCHILL DOES NOT FEEL THAT, WHY SHOULD WE? AND IT
MAY BE A VERY FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR HIM, FOR FRANK, I MEAN,
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO A GIRL OF SUCH STEADINESS
OF CHARACTER AND GOOD JUDGMENT AS I HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN HER CREDIT FOR--
AND STILL AM DISPOSED TO GIVE HER CREDIT FOR, IN SPITE OF THIS
ONE GREAT DEVIATION FROM THE STRICT RULE OF RIGHT.  AND HOW MUCH
MAY BE SAID IN HER SITUATION FOR EVEN THAT ERROR!"

"MUCH, INDEED!" CRIED EMMA FEELINGLY.  "IF A WOMAN CAN EVER
BE EXCUSED FOR THINKING ONLY OF HERSELF, IT IS IN A SITUATION
LIKE JANE FAIRFAX'S.--OF SUCH, ONE MAY ALMOST SAY, THAT `THE
WORLD IS NOT THEIR'S, NOR THE WORLD'S LAW.'"

SHE MET MR. WESTON ON HIS ENTRANCE, WITH A SMILING COUNTENANCE,
EXCLAIMING,

"A VERY PRETTY TRICK YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING ME, UPON MY WORD!
THIS WAS A DEVICE, I SUPPOSE, TO SPORT WITH MY CURIOSITY,
AND EXERCISE MY TALENT OF GUESSING.  BUT YOU REALLY FRIGHTENED ME.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD LOST HALF YOUR PROPERTY, AT LEAST.  AND HERE,
INSTEAD OF ITS BEING A MATTER OF CONDOLENCE, IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONE
OF CONGRATULATION.--I CONGRATULATE YOU, MR. WESTON, WITH ALL MY HEART,
ON THE PROSPECT OF HAVING ONE OF THE MOST LOVELY AND ACCOMPLISHED
YOUNG WOMEN IN ENGLAND FOR YOUR DAUGHTER."

A GLANCE OR TWO BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE, CONVINCED HIM THAT ALL WAS
AS RIGHT AS THIS SPEECH PROCLAIMED; AND ITS HAPPY EFFECT ON HIS SPIRITS
WAS IMMEDIATE.  HIS AIR AND VOICE RECOVERED THEIR USUAL BRISKNESS:
HE SHOOK HER HEARTILY AND GRATEFULLY BY THE HAND, AND ENTERED
ON THE SUBJECT IN A MANNER TO PROVE, THAT HE NOW ONLY WANTED
TIME AND PERSUASION TO THINK THE ENGAGEMENT NO VERY BAD THING.
HIS COMPANIONS SUGGESTED ONLY WHAT COULD PALLIATE IMPRUDENCE,
OR SMOOTH OBJECTIONS; AND BY THE TIME THEY HAD TALKED IT ALL
OVER TOGETHER, AND HE HAD TALKED IT ALL OVER AGAIN WITH EMMA,
IN THEIR WALK BACK TO HARTFIELD, HE WAS BECOME PERFECTLY RECONCILED,
AND NOT FAR FROM THINKING IT THE VERY BEST THING THAT FRANK COULD
POSSIBLY HAVE DONE.



CHAPTER XI


"HARRIET, POOR HARRIET!"--THOSE WERE THE WORDS; IN THEM LAY THE
TORMENTING IDEAS WHICH EMMA COULD NOT GET RID OF, AND WHICH CONSTITUTED
THE REAL MISERY OF THE BUSINESS TO HER.  FRANK CHURCHILL HAD BEHAVED
VERY ILL BY HERSELF--VERY ILL IN MANY WAYS,--BUT IT WAS NOT SO MUCH
_HIS_ BEHAVIOUR AS HER _OWN_, WHICH MADE HER SO ANGRY WITH HIM.
IT WAS THE SCRAPE WHICH HE HAD DRAWN HER INTO ON HARRIET'S ACCOUNT,
THAT GAVE THE DEEPEST HUE TO HIS OFFENCE.--POOR HARRIET! TO BE A SECOND
TIME THE DUPE OF HER MISCONCEPTIONS AND FLATTERY.  MR. KNIGHTLEY
HAD SPOKEN PROPHETICALLY, WHEN HE ONCE SAID, "EMMA, YOU HAVE BEEN
NO FRIEND TO HARRIET SMITH."--SHE WAS AFRAID SHE HAD DONE HER NOTHING
BUT DISSERVICE.--IT WAS TRUE THAT SHE HAD NOT TO CHARGE HERSELF,
IN THIS INSTANCE AS IN THE FORMER, WITH BEING THE SOLE AND ORIGINAL
AUTHOR OF THE MISCHIEF; WITH HAVING SUGGESTED SUCH FEELINGS AS MIGHT
OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE ENTERED HARRIET'S IMAGINATION; FOR HARRIET
HAD ACKNOWLEDGED HER ADMIRATION AND PREFERENCE OF FRANK CHURCHILL
BEFORE SHE HAD EVER GIVEN HER A HINT ON THE SUBJECT; BUT SHE FELT
COMPLETELY GUILTY OF HAVING ENCOURAGED WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE REPRESSED.
SHE MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THE INDULGENCE AND INCREASE OF SUCH SENTIMENTS.
HER INFLUENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH.  AND NOW SHE WAS VERY CONSCIOUS
THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE PREVENTED THEM.--SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN
RISKING HER FRIEND'S HAPPINESS ON MOST INSUFFICIENT GROUNDS.
COMMON SENSE WOULD HAVE DIRECTED HER TO TELL HARRIET, THAT SHE
MUST NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO THINK OF HIM, AND THAT THERE WERE FIVE
HUNDRED CHANCES TO ONE AGAINST HIS EVER CARING FOR HER.--"BUT, WITH
COMMON SENSE," SHE ADDED, "I AM AFRAID I HAVE HAD LITTLE TO DO."

SHE WAS EXTREMELY ANGRY WITH HERSELF.  IF SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
ANGRY WITH FRANK CHURCHILL TOO, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFUL.--
AS FOR JANE FAIRFAX, SHE MIGHT AT LEAST RELIEVE HER FEELINGS
FROM ANY PRESENT SOLICITUDE ON HER ACCOUNT.  HARRIET WOULD
BE ANXIETY ENOUGH; SHE NEED NO LONGER BE UNHAPPY ABOUT JANE,
WHOSE TROUBLES AND WHOSE ILL-HEALTH HAVING, OF COURSE, THE SAME ORIGIN,
MUST BE EQUALLY UNDER CURE.--HER DAYS OF INSIGNIFICANCE AND EVIL
WERE OVER.--SHE WOULD SOON BE WELL, AND HAPPY, AND PROSPEROUS.--
EMMA COULD NOW IMAGINE WHY HER OWN ATTENTIONS HAD BEEN SLIGHTED.
THIS DISCOVERY LAID MANY SMALLER MATTERS OPEN.  NO DOUBT IT HAD BEEN
FROM JEALOUSY.--IN JANE'S EYES SHE HAD BEEN A RIVAL; AND WELL MIGHT
ANY THING SHE COULD OFFER OF ASSISTANCE OR REGARD BE REPULSED.
AN AIRING IN THE HARTFIELD CARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RACK,
AND ARROWROOT FROM THE HARTFIELD STOREROOM MUST HAVE BEEN POISON.
SHE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL; AND AS FAR AS HER MIND COULD DISENGAGE ITSELF
FROM THE INJUSTICE AND SELFISHNESS OF ANGRY FEELINGS, SHE ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT JANE FAIRFAX WOULD HAVE NEITHER ELEVATION NOR HAPPINESS BEYOND
HER DESERT.  BUT POOR HARRIET WAS SUCH AN ENGROSSING CHARGE!
THERE WAS LITTLE SYMPATHY TO BE SPARED FOR ANY BODY ELSE.
EMMA WAS SADLY FEARFUL THAT THIS SECOND DISAPPOINTMENT WOULD BE
MORE SEVERE THAN THE FIRST.  CONSIDERING THE VERY SUPERIOR CLAIMS
OF THE OBJECT, IT OUGHT; AND JUDGING BY ITS APPARENTLY STRONGER EFFECT
ON HARRIET'S MIND, PRODUCING RESERVE AND SELF-COMMAND, IT WOULD.--
SHE MUST COMMUNICATE THE PAINFUL TRUTH, HOWEVER, AND AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE.  AN INJUNCTION OF SECRESY HAD BEEN AMONG MR. WESTON'S
PARTING WORDS.  "FOR THE PRESENT, THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS TO BE
COMPLETELY A SECRET.  MR. CHURCHILL HAD MADE A POINT OF IT,
AS A TOKEN OF RESPECT TO THE WIFE HE HAD SO VERY RECENTLY LOST;
AND EVERY BODY ADMITTED IT TO BE NO MORE THAN DUE DECORUM."--
EMMA HAD PROMISED; BUT STILL HARRIET MUST BE EXCEPTED.  IT WAS HER
SUPERIOR DUTY.

IN SPITE OF HER VEXATION, SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING IT ALMOST RIDICULOUS,
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE VERY SAME DISTRESSING AND DELICATE OFFICE TO
PERFORM BY HARRIET, WHICH MRS. WESTON HAD JUST GONE THROUGH BY HERSELF.
THE INTELLIGENCE, WHICH HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUSLY ANNOUNCED TO HER,
SHE WAS NOW TO BE ANXIOUSLY ANNOUNCING TO ANOTHER.  HER HEART BEAT
QUICK ON HEARING HARRIET'S FOOTSTEP AND VOICE; SO, SHE SUPPOSED,
HAD POOR MRS. WESTON FELT WHEN _SHE_ WAS APPROACHING RANDALLS.
COULD THE EVENT OF THE DISCLOSURE BEAR AN EQUAL RESEMBLANCE!--
BUT OF THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, THERE COULD BE NO CHANCE.

"WELL, MISS WOODHOUSE!" CRIED HARRIET, COMING EAGERLY INTO THE ROOM--
"IS NOT THIS THE ODDEST NEWS THAT EVER WAS?"

"WHAT NEWS DO YOU MEAN?" REPLIED EMMA, UNABLE TO GUESS, BY LOOK
OR VOICE, WHETHER HARRIET COULD INDEED HAVE RECEIVED ANY HINT.

"ABOUT JANE FAIRFAX.  DID YOU EVER HEAR ANY THING SO STRANGE?
OH!--YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF OWNING IT TO ME, FOR MR. WESTON HAS
TOLD ME HIMSELF.  I MET HIM JUST NOW.  HE TOLD ME IT WAS TO BE
A GREAT SECRET; AND, THEREFORE, I SHOULD NOT THINK OF MENTIONING
IT TO ANY BODY BUT YOU, BUT HE SAID YOU KNEW IT."

"WHAT DID MR. WESTON TELL YOU?"--SAID EMMA, STILL PERPLEXED.

"OH! HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT; THAT JANE FAIRFAX AND MR. FRANK
CHURCHILL ARE TO BE MARRIED, AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PRIVATELY
ENGAGED TO ONE ANOTHER THIS LONG WHILE.  HOW VERY ODD!"

IT WAS, INDEED, SO ODD; HARRIET'S BEHAVIOUR WAS SO EXTREMELY ODD,
THAT EMMA DID NOT KNOW HOW TO UNDERSTAND IT.  HER CHARACTER APPEARED
ABSOLUTELY CHANGED.  SHE SEEMED TO PROPOSE SHEWING NO AGITATION,
OR DISAPPOINTMENT, OR PECULIAR CONCERN IN THE DISCOVERY.  EMMA LOOKED
AT HER, QUITE UNABLE TO SPEAK.

"HAD YOU ANY IDEA," CRIED HARRIET, "OF HIS BEING IN LOVE
WITH HER?--YOU, PERHAPS, MIGHT.--YOU (BLUSHING AS SHE SPOKE)
WHO CAN SEE INTO EVERY BODY'S HEART; BUT NOBODY ELSE--"

"UPON MY WORD," SAID EMMA, "I BEGIN TO DOUBT MY HAVING ANY SUCH TALENT.
CAN YOU SERIOUSLY ASK ME, HARRIET, WHETHER I IMAGINED HIM ATTACHED
TO ANOTHER WOMAN AT THE VERY TIME THAT I WAS--TACITLY, IF NOT OPENLY--
ENCOURAGING YOU TO GIVE WAY TO YOUR OWN FEELINGS?--I NEVER HAD
THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION, TILL WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, OF MR. FRANK
CHURCHILL'S HAVING THE LEAST REGARD FOR JANE FAIRFAX.  YOU MAY BE
VERY SURE THAT IF I HAD, I SHOULD HAVE CAUTIONED YOU ACCORDINGLY."

"ME!" CRIED HARRIET, COLOURING, AND ASTONISHED.  "WHY SHOULD YOU
CAUTION ME?--YOU DO NOT THINK I CARE ABOUT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL."

"I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR YOU SPEAK SO STOUTLY ON THE SUBJECT,"
REPLIED EMMA, SMILING; "BUT YOU DO NOT MEAN TO DENY THAT THERE
WAS A TIME--AND NOT VERY DISTANT EITHER--WHEN YOU GAVE ME REASON
TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DID CARE ABOUT HIM?"

"HIM!--NEVER, NEVER.  DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW COULD YOU SO MISTAKE ME?"
TURNING AWAY DISTRESSED.

"HARRIET!" CRIED EMMA, AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE--"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?--
GOOD HEAVEN! WHAT DO YOU MEAN?--MISTAKE YOU!--AM I TO SUPPOSE THEN?--"

SHE COULD NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD.--HER VOICE WAS LOST; AND SHE
SAT DOWN, WAITING IN GREAT TERROR TILL HARRIET SHOULD ANSWER.

HARRIET, WHO WAS STANDING AT SOME DISTANCE, AND WITH FACE TURNED
FROM HER, DID NOT IMMEDIATELY SAY ANY THING; AND WHEN SHE DID SPEAK,
IT WAS IN A VOICE NEARLY AS AGITATED AS EMMA'S.

"I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE," SHE BEGAN, "THAT YOU
COULD HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD ME!  I KNOW WE AGREED NEVER TO NAME HIM--
BUT CONSIDERING HOW INFINITELY SUPERIOR HE IS TO EVERY BODY ELSE,
I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT I COULD BE SUPPOSED
TO MEAN ANY OTHER PERSON.  MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, INDEED!  I DO NOT
KNOW WHO WOULD EVER LOOK AT HIM IN THE COMPANY OF THE OTHER.
I HOPE I HAVE A BETTER TASTE THAN TO THINK OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL,
WHO IS LIKE NOBODY BY HIS SIDE.  AND THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
SO MISTAKEN, IS AMAZING!--I AM SURE, BUT FOR BELIEVING THAT YOU
ENTIRELY APPROVED AND MEANT TO ENCOURAGE ME IN MY ATTACHMENT,
I SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED IT AT FIRST TOO GREAT A PRESUMPTION ALMOST,
TO DARE TO THINK OF HIM.  AT FIRST, IF YOU HAD NOT TOLD ME
THAT MORE WONDERFUL THINGS HAD HAPPENED; THAT THERE HAD BEEN
MATCHES OF GREATER DISPARITY (THOSE WERE YOUR VERY WORDS);--
I SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO GIVE WAY TO--I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT
IT POSSIBLE--BUT IF _YOU_, WHO HAD BEEN ALWAYS ACQUAINTED WITH HIM--"

"HARRIET!" CRIED EMMA, COLLECTING HERSELF RESOLUTELY--"LET US
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER NOW, WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FARTHER MISTAKE.
ARE YOU SPEAKING OF--MR. KNIGHTLEY?"

"TO BE SURE I AM.  I NEVER COULD HAVE AN IDEA OF ANY BODY ELSE--
AND SO I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.  WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT HIM, IT WAS AS CLEAR
AS POSSIBLE."

"NOT QUITE," RETURNED EMMA, WITH FORCED CALMNESS, "FOR ALL THAT
YOU THEN SAID, APPEARED TO ME TO RELATE TO A DIFFERENT PERSON.
I COULD ALMOST ASSERT THAT YOU HAD _NAMED_ MR. FRANK CHURCHILL.
I AM SURE THE SERVICE MR. FRANK CHURCHILL HAD RENDERED YOU,
IN PROTECTING YOU FROM THE GIPSIES, WAS SPOKEN OF."

"OH!  MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW YOU DO FORGET!"

"MY DEAR HARRIET, I PERFECTLY REMEMBER THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT I
SAID ON THE OCCASION.  I TOLD YOU THAT I DID NOT WONDER AT
YOUR ATTACHMENT; THAT CONSIDERING THE SERVICE HE HAD RENDERED YOU,
IT WAS EXTREMELY NATURAL:--AND YOU AGREED TO IT, EXPRESSING YOURSELF
VERY WARMLY AS TO YOUR SENSE OF THAT SERVICE, AND MENTIONING
EVEN WHAT YOUR SENSATIONS HAD BEEN IN SEEING HIM COME FORWARD
TO YOUR RESCUE.--THE IMPRESSION OF IT IS STRONG ON MY MEMORY."

"OH, DEAR," CRIED HARRIET, "NOW I RECOLLECT WHAT YOU MEAN; BUT I
WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT AT THE TIME.  IT WAS NOT
THE GIPSIES--IT WAS NOT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL THAT I MEANT.  NO! (WITH
SOME ELEVATION) I WAS THINKING OF A MUCH MORE PRECIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE--
OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S COMING AND ASKING ME TO DANCE, WHEN MR. ELTON
WOULD NOT STAND UP WITH ME; AND WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER PARTNER IN
THE ROOM.  THAT WAS THE KIND ACTION; THAT WAS THE NOBLE BENEVOLENCE
AND GENEROSITY; THAT WAS THE SERVICE WHICH MADE ME BEGIN TO FEEL
HOW SUPERIOR HE WAS TO EVERY OTHER BEING UPON EARTH."

"GOOD GOD!" CRIED EMMA, "THIS HAS BEEN A MOST UNFORTUNATE--
MOST DEPLORABLE MISTAKE!--WHAT IS TO BE DONE?"

"YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ENCOURAGED ME, THEN, IF YOU HAD UNDERSTOOD ME?
AT LEAST, HOWEVER, I CANNOT BE WORSE OFF THAN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN,
IF THE OTHER HAD BEEN THE PERSON; AND NOW--IT _IS_ POSSIBLE--"

SHE PAUSED A FEW MOMENTS.  EMMA COULD NOT SPEAK.

"I DO NOT WONDER, MISS WOODHOUSE," SHE RESUMED, "THAT YOU SHOULD FEEL
A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO, AS TO ME OR AS TO ANY BODY.
YOU MUST THINK ONE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TIMES MORE ABOVE ME THAN
THE OTHER.  BUT I HOPE, MISS WOODHOUSE, THAT SUPPOSING--THAT IF--
STRANGE AS IT MAY APPEAR--.  BUT YOU KNOW THEY WERE YOUR OWN WORDS,
THAT _MORE_ WONDERFUL THINGS HAD HAPPENED, MATCHES OF _GREATER_ DISPARITY
HAD TAKEN PLACE THAN BETWEEN MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND ME; AND, THEREFORE,
IT SEEMS AS IF SUCH A THING EVEN AS THIS, MAY HAVE OCCURRED BEFORE--
AND IF I SHOULD BE SO FORTUNATE, BEYOND EXPRESSION, AS TO--
IF MR. KNIGHTLEY SHOULD REALLY--IF _HE_ DOES NOT MIND THE DISPARITY,
I HOPE, DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU WILL NOT SET YOURSELF AGAINST IT,
AND TRY TO PUT DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY.  BUT YOU ARE TOO GOOD FOR THAT,
I AM SURE."

HARRIET WAS STANDING AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS.  EMMA TURNED ROUND
TO LOOK AT HER IN CONSTERNATION, AND HASTILY SAID,

"HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S RETURNING YOUR AFFECTION?"

"YES," REPLIED HARRIET MODESTLY, BUT NOT FEARFULLY--"I MUST SAY
THAT I HAVE."

EMMA'S EYES WERE INSTANTLY WITHDRAWN; AND SHE SAT SILENTLY MEDITATING,
IN A FIXED ATTITUDE, FOR A FEW MINUTES.  A FEW MINUTES WERE SUFFICIENT
FOR MAKING HER ACQUAINTED WITH HER OWN HEART.  A MIND LIKE HERS,
ONCE OPENING TO SUSPICION, MADE RAPID PROGRESS.  SHE TOUCHED--
SHE ADMITTED--SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THE WHOLE TRUTH.  WHY WAS IT
SO MUCH WORSE THAT HARRIET SHOULD BE IN LOVE WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY,
THAN WITH FRANK CHURCHILL?  WHY WAS THE EVIL SO DREADFULLY INCREASED
BY HARRIET'S HAVING SOME HOPE OF A RETURN?  IT DARTED THROUGH HER,
WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW, THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY MUST MARRY NO ONE
BUT HERSELF!

HER OWN CONDUCT, AS WELL AS HER OWN HEART, WAS BEFORE HER IN THE
SAME FEW MINUTES.  SHE SAW IT ALL WITH A CLEARNESS WHICH HAD
NEVER BLESSED HER BEFORE.  HOW IMPROPERLY HAD SHE BEEN ACTING
BY HARRIET!  HOW INCONSIDERATE, HOW INDELICATE, HOW IRRATIONAL,
HOW UNFEELING HAD BEEN HER CONDUCT!  WHAT BLINDNESS, WHAT MADNESS,
HAD LED HER ON!  IT STRUCK HER WITH DREADFUL FORCE, AND SHE
WAS READY TO GIVE IT EVERY BAD NAME IN THE WORLD.  SOME PORTION
OF RESPECT FOR HERSELF, HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF ALL THESE DEMERITS--
SOME CONCERN FOR HER OWN APPEARANCE, AND A STRONG SENSE OF JUSTICE
BY HARRIET--(THERE WOULD BE NO NEED OF _COMPASSION_ TO THE GIRL
WHO BELIEVED HERSELF LOVED BY MR. KNIGHTLEY--BUT JUSTICE REQUIRED
THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE MADE UNHAPPY BY ANY COLDNESS NOW,)
GAVE EMMA THE RESOLUTION TO SIT AND ENDURE FARTHER WITH CALMNESS,
WITH EVEN APPARENT KINDNESS.--FOR HER OWN ADVANTAGE INDEED, IT WAS FIT
THAT THE UTMOST EXTENT OF HARRIET'S HOPES SHOULD BE ENQUIRED INTO;
AND HARRIET HAD DONE NOTHING TO FORFEIT THE REGARD AND INTEREST
WHICH HAD BEEN SO VOLUNTARILY FORMED AND MAINTAINED--OR TO DESERVE
TO BE SLIGHTED BY THE PERSON, WHOSE COUNSELS HAD NEVER LED HER RIGHT.--
ROUSING FROM REFLECTION, THEREFORE, AND SUBDUING HER EMOTION,
SHE TURNED TO HARRIET AGAIN, AND, IN A MORE INVITING ACCENT, RENEWED
THE CONVERSATION; FOR AS TO THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD FIRST INTRODUCED IT,
THE WONDERFUL STORY OF JANE FAIRFAX, THAT WAS QUITE SUNK AND LOST.--
NEITHER OF THEM THOUGHT BUT OF MR. KNIGHTLEY AND THEMSELVES.

HARRIET, WHO HAD BEEN STANDING IN NO UNHAPPY REVERIE, WAS YET VERY GLAD
TO BE CALLED FROM IT, BY THE NOW ENCOURAGING MANNER OF SUCH A JUDGE,
AND SUCH A FRIEND AS MISS WOODHOUSE, AND ONLY WANTED INVITATION,
TO GIVE THE HISTORY OF HER HOPES WITH GREAT, THOUGH TREMBLING
DELIGHT.--EMMA'S TREMBLINGS AS SHE ASKED, AND AS SHE LISTENED,
WERE BETTER CONCEALED THAN HARRIET'S, BUT THEY WERE NOT LESS.
HER VOICE WAS NOT UNSTEADY; BUT HER MIND WAS IN ALL THE PERTURBATION
THAT SUCH A DEVELOPMENT OF SELF, SUCH A BURST OF THREATENING EVIL,
SUCH A CONFUSION OF SUDDEN AND PERPLEXING EMOTIONS, MUST CREATE.--
SHE LISTENED WITH MUCH INWARD SUFFERING, BUT WITH GREAT OUTWARD
PATIENCE, TO HARRIET'S DETAIL.--METHODICAL, OR WELL ARRANGED,
OR VERY WELL DELIVERED, IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO BE;
BUT IT CONTAINED, WHEN SEPARATED FROM ALL THE FEEBLENESS AND
TAUTOLOGY OF THE NARRATION, A SUBSTANCE TO SINK HER SPIRIT--
ESPECIALLY WITH THE CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH HER OWN MEMORY
BROUGHT IN FAVOUR OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S MOST IMPROVED OPINION OF HARRIET.

HARRIET HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF A DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR EVER SINCE
THOSE TWO DECISIVE DANCES.--EMMA KNEW THAT HE HAD, ON THAT OCCASION,
FOUND HER MUCH SUPERIOR TO HIS EXPECTATION.  FROM THAT EVENING,
OR AT LEAST FROM THE TIME OF MISS WOODHOUSE'S ENCOURAGING HER
TO THINK OF HIM, HARRIET HAD BEGUN TO BE SENSIBLE OF HIS TALKING
TO HER MUCH MORE THAN HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO, AND OF HIS HAVING
INDEED QUITE A DIFFERENT MANNER TOWARDS HER; A MANNER OF KINDNESS
AND SWEETNESS!--LATTERLY SHE HAD BEEN MORE AND MORE AWARE OF IT.
WHEN THEY HAD BEEN ALL WALKING TOGETHER, HE HAD SO OFTEN COME AND WALKED
BY HER, AND TALKED SO VERY DELIGHTFULLY!--HE SEEMED TO WANT TO BE
ACQUAINTED WITH HER.  EMMA KNEW IT TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH THE CASE.
SHE HAD OFTEN OBSERVED THE CHANGE, TO ALMOST THE SAME EXTENT.--
HARRIET REPEATED EXPRESSIONS OF APPROBATION AND PRAISE FROM HIM--
AND EMMA FELT THEM TO BE IN THE CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH WHAT SHE HAD
KNOWN OF HIS OPINION OF HARRIET.  HE PRAISED HER FOR BEING WITHOUT
ART OR AFFECTATION, FOR HAVING SIMPLE, HONEST, GENEROUS, FEELINGS.--
SHE KNEW THAT HE SAW SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS IN HARRIET; HE HAD DWELT
ON THEM TO HER MORE THAN ONCE.--MUCH THAT LIVED IN HARRIET'S MEMORY,
MANY LITTLE PARTICULARS OF THE NOTICE SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM HIM, A LOOK,
A SPEECH, A REMOVAL FROM ONE CHAIR TO ANOTHER, A COMPLIMENT IMPLIED,
A PREFERENCE INFERRED, HAD BEEN UNNOTICED, BECAUSE UNSUSPECTED,
BY EMMA.  CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT SWELL TO HALF AN HOUR'S RELATION,
AND CONTAINED MULTIPLIED PROOFS TO HER WHO HAD SEEN THEM, HAD PASSED
UNDISCERNED BY HER WHO NOW HEARD THEM; BUT THE TWO LATEST OCCURRENCES
TO BE MENTIONED, THE TWO OF STRONGEST PROMISE TO HARRIET, WERE NOT
WITHOUT SOME DEGREE OF WITNESS FROM EMMA HERSELF.--THE FIRST,
WAS HIS WALKING WITH HER APART FROM THE OTHERS, IN THE LIME-WALK
AT DONWELL, WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WALKING SOME TIME BEFORE EMMA CAME,
AND HE HAD TAKEN PAINS (AS SHE WAS CONVINCED) TO DRAW HER FROM
THE REST TO HIMSELF--AND AT FIRST, HE HAD TALKED TO HER IN A MORE
PARTICULAR WAY THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE, IN A VERY PARTICULAR
WAY INDEED!--(HARRIET COULD NOT RECALL IT WITHOUT A BLUSH.) HE SEEMED
TO BE ALMOST ASKING HER, WHETHER HER AFFECTIONS WERE ENGAGED.--
BUT AS SOON AS SHE (MISS WOODHOUSE) APPEARED LIKELY TO JOIN THEM,
HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT, AND BEGAN TALKING ABOUT FARMING:--
THE SECOND, WAS HIS HAVING SAT TALKING WITH HER NEARLY HALF AN HOUR
BEFORE EMMA CAME BACK FROM HER VISIT, THE VERY LAST MORNING OF HIS
BEING AT HARTFIELD--THOUGH, WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN, HE HAD SAID
THAT HE COULD NOT STAY FIVE MINUTES--AND HIS HAVING TOLD HER,
DURING THEIR CONVERSATION, THAT THOUGH HE MUST GO TO LONDON,
IT WAS VERY MUCH AGAINST HIS INCLINATION THAT HE LEFT HOME AT ALL,
WHICH WAS MUCH MORE (AS EMMA FELT) THAN HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED TO _HER_.
THE SUPERIOR DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE TOWARDS HARRIET, WHICH THIS ONE
ARTICLE MARKED, GAVE HER SEVERE PAIN.

ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FIRST OF THE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES, SHE DID,
AFTER A LITTLE REFLECTION, VENTURE THE FOLLOWING QUESTION.
"MIGHT HE NOT?--IS NOT IT POSSIBLE, THAT WHEN ENQUIRING, AS YOU THOUGHT,
INTO THE STATE OF YOUR AFFECTIONS, HE MIGHT BE ALLUDING TO MR. MARTIN--
HE MIGHT HAVE MR. MARTIN'S INTEREST IN VIEW?  BUT HARRIET REJECTED
THE SUSPICION WITH SPIRIT.

"MR. MARTIN!  NO INDEED!--THERE WAS NOT A HINT OF MR. MARTIN.
I HOPE I KNOW BETTER NOW, THAN TO CARE FOR MR. MARTIN, OR TO BE
SUSPECTED OF IT."

WHEN HARRIET HAD CLOSED HER EVIDENCE, SHE APPEALED TO HER DEAR
MISS WOODHOUSE, TO SAY WHETHER SHE HAD NOT GOOD GROUND FOR HOPE.

"I NEVER SHOULD HAVE PRESUMED TO THINK OF IT AT FIRST," SAID SHE,
"BUT FOR YOU.  YOU TOLD ME TO OBSERVE HIM CAREFULLY, AND LET
HIS BEHAVIOUR BE THE RULE OF MINE--AND SO I HAVE.  BUT NOW I SEEM
TO FEEL THAT I MAY DESERVE HIM; AND THAT IF HE DOES CHUSE ME,
IT WILL NOT BE ANY THING SO VERY WONDERFUL."

THE BITTER FEELINGS OCCASIONED BY THIS SPEECH, THE MANY BITTER
FEELINGS, MADE THE UTMOST EXERTION NECESSARY ON EMMA'S SIDE,
TO ENABLE HER TO SAY ON REPLY,

"HARRIET, I WILL ONLY VENTURE TO DECLARE, THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY IS
THE LAST MAN IN THE WORLD, WHO WOULD INTENTIONALLY GIVE ANY WOMAN
THE IDEA OF HIS FEELING FOR HER MORE THAN HE REALLY DOES."

HARRIET SEEMED READY TO WORSHIP HER FRIEND FOR A SENTENCE SO SATISFACTORY;
AND EMMA WAS ONLY SAVED FROM RAPTURES AND FONDNESS, WHICH AT
THAT MOMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFUL PENANCE, BY THE SOUND OF HER
FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS.  HE WAS COMING THROUGH THE HALL.  HARRIET WAS
TOO MUCH AGITATED TO ENCOUNTER HIM.  "SHE COULD NOT COMPOSE HERSELF--
MR. WOODHOUSE WOULD BE ALARMED--SHE HAD BETTER GO;"--WITH MOST READY
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM HER FRIEND, THEREFORE, SHE PASSED OFF THROUGH
ANOTHER DOOR--AND THE MOMENT SHE WAS GONE, THIS WAS THE SPONTANEOUS
BURST OF EMMA'S FEELINGS:  "OH GOD! THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN HER!"

THE REST OF THE DAY, THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, WERE HARDLY ENOUGH
FOR HER THOUGHTS.--SHE WAS BEWILDERED AMIDST THE CONFUSION
OF ALL THAT HAD RUSHED ON HER WITHIN THE LAST FEW HOURS.
EVERY MOMENT HAD BROUGHT A FRESH SURPRIZE; AND EVERY SURPRIZE
MUST BE MATTER OF HUMILIATION TO HER.--HOW TO UNDERSTAND IT ALL!
HOW TO UNDERSTAND THE DECEPTIONS SHE HAD BEEN THUS PRACTISING
ON HERSELF, AND LIVING UNDER!--THE BLUNDERS, THE BLINDNESS OF HER
OWN HEAD AND HEART!--SHE SAT STILL, SHE WALKED ABOUT, SHE TRIED HER
OWN ROOM, SHE TRIED THE SHRUBBERY--IN EVERY PLACE, EVERY POSTURE,
SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE HAD ACTED MOST WEAKLY; THAT SHE HAD BEEN IMPOSED
ON BY OTHERS IN A MOST MORTIFYING DEGREE; THAT SHE HAD BEEN IMPOSING
ON HERSELF IN A DEGREE YET MORE MORTIFYING; THAT SHE WAS WRETCHED,
AND SHOULD PROBABLY FIND THIS DAY BUT THE BEGINNING OF WRETCHEDNESS.

TO UNDERSTAND, THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND HER OWN HEART, WAS THE
FIRST ENDEAVOUR.  TO THAT POINT WENT EVERY LEISURE MOMENT WHICH HER
FATHER'S CLAIMS ON HER ALLOWED, AND EVERY MOMENT OF INVOLUNTARY
ABSENCE OF MIND.

HOW LONG HAD MR. KNIGHTLEY BEEN SO DEAR TO HER, AS EVERY FEELING
DECLARED HIM NOW TO BE?  WHEN HAD HIS INFLUENCE, SUCH INFLUENCE BEGUN?--
WHEN HAD HE SUCCEEDED TO THAT PLACE IN HER AFFECTION, WHICH FRANK
CHURCHILL HAD ONCE, FOR A SHORT PERIOD, OCCUPIED?--SHE LOOKED BACK;
SHE COMPARED THE TWO--COMPARED THEM, AS THEY HAD ALWAYS STOOD IN
HER ESTIMATION, FROM THE TIME OF THE LATTER'S BECOMING KNOWN TO HER--
AND AS THEY MUST AT ANY TIME HAVE BEEN COMPARED BY HER, HAD IT--
OH! HAD IT, BY ANY BLESSED FELICITY, OCCURRED TO HER, TO INSTITUTE
THE COMPARISON.--SHE SAW THAT THERE NEVER HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN SHE
DID NOT CONSIDER MR. KNIGHTLEY AS INFINITELY THE SUPERIOR, OR WHEN
HIS REGARD FOR HER HAD NOT BEEN INFINITELY THE MOST DEAR.  SHE SAW,
THAT IN PERSUADING HERSELF, IN FANCYING, IN ACTING TO THE CONTRARY,
SHE HAD BEEN ENTIRELY UNDER A DELUSION, TOTALLY IGNORANT OF HER
OWN HEART--AND, IN SHORT, THAT SHE HAD NEVER REALLY CARED FOR FRANK
CHURCHILL AT ALL!

THIS WAS THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST SERIES OF REFLECTION.
THIS WAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF HERSELF, ON THE FIRST QUESTION OF INQUIRY,
WHICH SHE REACHED; AND WITHOUT BEING LONG IN REACHING IT.--
SHE WAS MOST SORROWFULLY INDIGNANT; ASHAMED OF EVERY SENSATION
BUT THE ONE REVEALED TO HER--HER AFFECTION FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY.--
EVERY OTHER PART OF HER MIND WAS DISGUSTING.

WITH INSUFFERABLE VANITY HAD SHE BELIEVED HERSELF IN THE SECRET OF EVERY
BODY'S FEELINGS; WITH UNPARDONABLE ARROGANCE PROPOSED TO ARRANGE EVERY
BODY'S DESTINY.  SHE WAS PROVED TO HAVE BEEN UNIVERSALLY MISTAKEN;
AND SHE HAD NOT QUITE DONE NOTHING--FOR SHE HAD DONE MISCHIEF.
SHE HAD BROUGHT EVIL ON HARRIET, ON HERSELF, AND SHE TOO MUCH FEARED,
ON MR. KNIGHTLEY.--WERE THIS MOST UNEQUAL OF ALL CONNEXIONS TO
TAKE PLACE, ON HER MUST REST ALL THE REPROACH OF HAVING GIVEN IT
A BEGINNING; FOR HIS ATTACHMENT, SHE MUST BELIEVE TO BE PRODUCED ONLY
BY A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARRIET'S;--AND EVEN WERE THIS NOT THE CASE,
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN HARRIET AT ALL BUT FOR HER FOLLY.

MR. KNIGHTLEY AND HARRIET SMITH!--IT WAS A UNION TO DISTANCE EVERY
WONDER OF THE KIND.--THE ATTACHMENT OF FRANK CHURCHILL AND JANE
FAIRFAX BECAME COMMONPLACE, THREADBARE, STALE IN THE COMPARISON,
EXCITING NO SURPRIZE, PRESENTING NO DISPARITY, AFFORDING NOTHING
TO BE SAID OR THOUGHT.--MR. KNIGHTLEY AND HARRIET SMITH!--SUCH AN
ELEVATION ON HER SIDE!  SUCH A DEBASEMENT ON HIS!  IT WAS HORRIBLE
TO EMMA TO THINK HOW IT MUST SINK HIM IN THE GENERAL OPINION,
TO FORESEE THE SMILES, THE SNEERS, THE MERRIMENT IT WOULD PROMPT AT
HIS EXPENSE; THE MORTIFICATION AND DISDAIN OF HIS BROTHER, THE THOUSAND
INCONVENIENCES TO HIMSELF.--COULD IT BE?--NO; IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
AND YET IT WAS FAR, VERY FAR, FROM IMPOSSIBLE.--WAS IT A NEW
CIRCUMSTANCE FOR A MAN OF FIRST-RATE ABILITIES TO BE CAPTIVATED BY
VERY INFERIOR POWERS?  WAS IT NEW FOR ONE, PERHAPS TOO BUSY TO SEEK,
TO BE THE PRIZE OF A GIRL WHO WOULD SEEK HIM?--WAS IT NEW FOR ANY
THING IN THIS WORLD TO BE UNEQUAL, INCONSISTENT, INCONGRUOUS--OR FOR
CHANCE AND CIRCUMSTANCE (AS SECOND CAUSES) TO DIRECT THE HUMAN FATE?

OH! HAD SHE NEVER BROUGHT HARRIET FORWARD!  HAD SHE LEFT HER WHERE
SHE OUGHT, AND WHERE HE HAD TOLD HER SHE OUGHT!--HAD SHE NOT,
WITH A FOLLY WHICH NO TONGUE COULD EXPRESS, PREVENTED HER MARRYING
THE UNEXCEPTIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO WOULD HAVE MADE HER HAPPY
AND RESPECTABLE IN THE LINE OF LIFE TO WHICH SHE OUGHT TO BELONG--
ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE; NONE OF THIS DREADFUL SEQUEL WOULD HAVE BEEN.

HOW HARRIET COULD EVER HAVE HAD THE PRESUMPTION TO RAISE
HER THOUGHTS TO MR. KNIGHTLEY!--HOW SHE COULD DARE TO FANCY
HERSELF THE CHOSEN OF SUCH A MAN TILL ACTUALLY ASSURED OF IT!--
BUT HARRIET WAS LESS HUMBLE, HAD FEWER SCRUPLES THAN FORMERLY.--
HER INFERIORITY, WHETHER OF MIND OR SITUATION, SEEMED LITTLE FELT.--
SHE HAD SEEMED MORE SENSIBLE OF MR. ELTON'S BEING TO STOOP
IN MARRYING HER, THAN SHE NOW SEEMED OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S.--
ALAS! WAS NOT THAT HER OWN DOING TOO?  WHO HAD BEEN AT PAINS TO GIVE
HARRIET NOTIONS OF SELF-CONSEQUENCE BUT HERSELF?--WHO BUT HERSELF
HAD TAUGHT HER, THAT SHE WAS TO ELEVATE HERSELF IF POSSIBLE,
AND THAT HER CLAIMS WERE GREAT TO A HIGH WORLDLY ESTABLISHMENT?--
IF HARRIET, FROM BEING HUMBLE, WERE GROWN VAIN, IT WAS HER DOING TOO.



CHAPTER XII


TILL NOW THAT SHE WAS THREATENED WITH ITS LOSS, EMMA HAD NEVER KNOWN
HOW MUCH OF HER HAPPINESS DEPENDED ON BEING _FIRST_ WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY,
FIRST IN INTEREST AND AFFECTION.--SATISFIED THAT IT WAS SO,
AND FEELING IT HER DUE, SHE HAD ENJOYED IT WITHOUT REFLECTION;
AND ONLY IN THE DREAD OF BEING SUPPLANTED, FOUND HOW INEXPRESSIBLY
IMPORTANT IT HAD BEEN.--LONG, VERY LONG, SHE FELT SHE HAD BEEN FIRST;
FOR, HAVING NO FEMALE CONNEXIONS OF HIS OWN, THERE HAD BEEN
ONLY ISABELLA WHOSE CLAIMS COULD BE COMPARED WITH HERS, AND SHE
HAD ALWAYS KNOWN EXACTLY HOW FAR HE LOVED AND ESTEEMED ISABELLA.
SHE HAD HERSELF BEEN FIRST WITH HIM FOR MANY YEARS PAST.
SHE HAD NOT DESERVED IT; SHE HAD OFTEN BEEN NEGLIGENT OR PERVERSE,
SLIGHTING HIS ADVICE, OR EVEN WILFULLY OPPOSING HIM, INSENSIBLE OF
HALF HIS MERITS, AND QUARRELLING WITH HIM BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT
ACKNOWLEDGE HER FALSE AND INSOLENT ESTIMATE OF HER OWN--BUT STILL,
FROM FAMILY ATTACHMENT AND HABIT, AND THOROUGH EXCELLENCE OF MIND,
HE HAD LOVED HER, AND WATCHED OVER HER FROM A GIRL, WITH AN ENDEAVOUR
TO IMPROVE HER, AND AN ANXIETY FOR HER DOING RIGHT, WHICH NO
OTHER CREATURE HAD AT ALL SHARED.  IN SPITE OF ALL HER FAULTS,
SHE KNEW SHE WAS DEAR TO HIM; MIGHT SHE NOT SAY, VERY DEAR?--
WHEN THE SUGGESTIONS OF HOPE, HOWEVER, WHICH MUST FOLLOW HERE,
PRESENTED THEMSELVES, SHE COULD NOT PRESUME TO INDULGE THEM.
HARRIET SMITH MIGHT THINK HERSELF NOT UNWORTHY OF BEING PECULIARLY,
EXCLUSIVELY, PASSIONATELY LOVED BY MR. KNIGHTLEY.  _SHE_ COULD NOT.
SHE COULD NOT FLATTER HERSELF WITH ANY IDEA OF BLINDNESS IN HIS ATTACHMENT
TO _HER_.  SHE HAD RECEIVED A VERY RECENT PROOF OF ITS IMPARTIALITY.--
HOW SHOCKED HAD HE BEEN BY HER BEHAVIOUR TO MISS BATES!  HOW DIRECTLY,
HOW STRONGLY HAD HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF TO HER ON THE SUBJECT!--NOT TOO
STRONGLY FOR THE OFFENCE--BUT FAR, FAR TOO STRONGLY TO ISSUE FROM
ANY FEELING SOFTER THAN UPRIGHT JUSTICE AND CLEAR-SIGHTED GOODWILL.--
SHE HAD NO HOPE, NOTHING TO DESERVE THE NAME OF HOPE, THAT HE COULD
HAVE THAT SORT OF AFFECTION FOR HERSELF WHICH WAS NOW IN QUESTION;
BUT THERE WAS A HOPE (AT TIMES A SLIGHT ONE, AT TIMES MUCH STRONGER,)
THAT HARRIET MIGHT HAVE DECEIVED HERSELF, AND BE OVERRATING HIS
REGARD FOR _HER_.--WISH IT SHE MUST, FOR HIS SAKE--BE THE CONSEQUENCE
NOTHING TO HERSELF, BUT HIS REMAINING SINGLE ALL HIS LIFE.
COULD SHE BE SECURE OF THAT, INDEED, OF HIS NEVER MARRYING AT ALL,
SHE BELIEVED SHE SHOULD BE PERFECTLY SATISFIED.--LET HIM BUT CONTINUE
THE SAME MR. KNIGHTLEY TO HER AND HER FATHER, THE SAME MR. KNIGHTLEY
TO ALL THE WORLD; LET DONWELL AND HARTFIELD LOSE NONE OF THEIR
PRECIOUS INTERCOURSE OF FRIENDSHIP AND CONFIDENCE, AND HER PEACE
WOULD BE FULLY SECURED.--MARRIAGE, IN FACT, WOULD NOT DO FOR HER.
IT WOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH WHAT SHE OWED TO HER FATHER, AND WITH
WHAT SHE FELT FOR HIM.  NOTHING SHOULD SEPARATE HER FROM HER FATHER.
SHE WOULD NOT MARRY, EVEN IF SHE WERE ASKED BY MR. KNIGHTLEY.

IT MUST BE HER ARDENT WISH THAT HARRIET MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED;
AND SHE HOPED, THAT WHEN ABLE TO SEE THEM TOGETHER AGAIN, SHE MIGHT AT
LEAST BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THE CHANCES FOR IT WERE.--SHE SHOULD
SEE THEM HENCEFORWARD WITH THE CLOSEST OBSERVANCE; AND WRETCHEDLY
AS SHE HAD HITHERTO MISUNDERSTOOD EVEN THOSE SHE WAS WATCHING,
SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ADMIT THAT SHE COULD BE BLINDED HERE.--
HE WAS EXPECTED BACK EVERY DAY.  THE POWER OF OBSERVATION WOULD BE
SOON GIVEN--FRIGHTFULLY SOON IT APPEARED WHEN HER THOUGHTS WERE IN
ONE COURSE.  IN THE MEANWHILE, SHE RESOLVED AGAINST SEEING HARRIET.--
IT WOULD DO NEITHER OF THEM GOOD, IT WOULD DO THE SUBJECT NO GOOD,
TO BE TALKING OF IT FARTHER.--SHE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO BE CONVINCED,
AS LONG AS SHE COULD DOUBT, AND YET HAD NO AUTHORITY FOR OPPOSING
HARRIET'S CONFIDENCE.  TO TALK WOULD BE ONLY TO IRRITATE.--SHE WROTE
TO HER, THEREFORE, KINDLY, BUT DECISIVELY, TO BEG THAT SHE WOULD NOT,
AT PRESENT, COME TO HARTFIELD; ACKNOWLEDGING IT TO BE HER CONVICTION,
THAT ALL FARTHER CONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSION OF _ONE_ TOPIC HAD BETTER
BE AVOIDED; AND HOPING, THAT IF A FEW DAYS WERE ALLOWED TO PASS BEFORE
THEY MET AGAIN, EXCEPT IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS--SHE OBJECTED ONLY
TO A TETE-A-TETE--THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACT AS IF THEY HAD FORGOTTEN
THE CONVERSATION OF YESTERDAY.--HARRIET SUBMITTED, AND APPROVED,
AND WAS GRATEFUL.

THIS POINT WAS JUST ARRANGED, WHEN A VISITOR ARRIVED TO TEAR EMMA'S
THOUGHTS A LITTLE FROM THE ONE SUBJECT WHICH HAD ENGROSSED THEM,
SLEEPING OR WAKING, THE LAST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS--MRS. WESTON, WHO HAD
BEEN CALLING ON HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW ELECT, AND TOOK HARTFIELD IN HER
WAY HOME, ALMOST AS MUCH IN DUTY TO EMMA AS IN PLEASURE TO HERSELF,
TO RELATE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF SO INTERESTING AN INTERVIEW.

MR. WESTON HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO MRS. BATES'S, AND GONE THROUGH HIS
SHARE OF THIS ESSENTIAL ATTENTION MOST HANDSOMELY; BUT SHE HAVING
THEN INDUCED MISS FAIRFAX TO JOIN HER IN AN AIRING, WAS NOW RETURNED
WITH MUCH MORE TO SAY, AND MUCH MORE TO SAY WITH SATISFACTION,
THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SPENT IN MRS. BATES'S PARLOUR, WITH ALL
THE ENCUMBRANCE OF AWKWARD FEELINGS, COULD HAVE AFFORDED.

A LITTLE CURIOSITY EMMA HAD; AND SHE MADE THE MOST OF IT WHILE
HER FRIEND RELATED.  MRS. WESTON HAD SET OFF TO PAY THE VISIT
IN A GOOD DEAL OF AGITATION HERSELF; AND IN THE FIRST PLACE HAD
WISHED NOT TO GO AT ALL AT PRESENT, TO BE ALLOWED MERELY TO WRITE
TO MISS FAIRFAX INSTEAD, AND TO DEFER THIS CEREMONIOUS CALL TILL
A LITTLE TIME HAD PASSED, AND MR. CHURCHILL COULD BE RECONCILED
TO THE ENGAGEMENT'S BECOMING KNOWN; AS, CONSIDERING EVERY THING,
SHE THOUGHT SUCH A VISIT COULD NOT BE PAID WITHOUT LEADING TO REPORTS:--
BUT MR. WESTON HAD THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY; HE WAS EXTREMELY ANXIOUS
TO SHEW HIS APPROBATION TO MISS FAIRFAX AND HER FAMILY, AND DID NOT
CONCEIVE THAT ANY SUSPICION COULD BE EXCITED BY IT; OR IF IT WERE,
THAT IT WOULD BE OF ANY CONSEQUENCE; FOR "SUCH THINGS," HE OBSERVED,
"ALWAYS GOT ABOUT."  EMMA SMILED, AND FELT THAT MR. WESTON HAD
VERY GOOD REASON FOR SAYING SO.  THEY HAD GONE, IN SHORT--AND VERY
GREAT HAD BEEN THE EVIDENT DISTRESS AND CONFUSION OF THE LADY.
SHE HAD HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK A WORD, AND EVERY LOOK AND ACTION
HAD SHEWN HOW DEEPLY SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM CONSCIOUSNESS.  THE QUIET,
HEART-FELT SATISFACTION OF THE OLD LADY, AND THE RAPTUROUS DELIGHT
OF HER DAUGHTER--WHO PROVED EVEN TOO JOYOUS TO TALK AS USUAL,
HAD BEEN A GRATIFYING, YET ALMOST AN AFFECTING, SCENE.  THEY WERE
BOTH SO TRULY RESPECTABLE IN THEIR HAPPINESS, SO DISINTERESTED
IN EVERY SENSATION; THOUGHT SO MUCH OF JANE; SO MUCH OF EVERY BODY,
AND SO LITTLE OF THEMSELVES, THAT EVERY KINDLY FEELING WAS AT WORK
FOR THEM.  MISS FAIRFAX'S RECENT ILLNESS HAD OFFERED A FAIR PLEA
FOR MRS. WESTON TO INVITE HER TO AN AIRING; SHE HAD DRAWN BACK AND
DECLINED AT FIRST, BUT, ON BEING PRESSED HAD YIELDED; AND, IN THE
COURSE OF THEIR DRIVE, MRS. WESTON HAD, BY GENTLE ENCOURAGEMENT,
OVERCOME SO MUCH OF HER EMBARRASSMENT, AS TO BRING HER TO CONVERSE
ON THE IMPORTANT SUBJECT.  APOLOGIES FOR HER SEEMINGLY UNGRACIOUS
SILENCE IN THEIR FIRST RECEPTION, AND THE WARMEST EXPRESSIONS OF THE
GRATITUDE SHE WAS ALWAYS FEELING TOWARDS HERSELF AND MR. WESTON,
MUST NECESSARILY OPEN THE CAUSE; BUT WHEN THESE EFFUSIONS WERE PUT BY,
THEY HAD TALKED A GOOD DEAL OF THE PRESENT AND OF THE FUTURE STATE
OF THE ENGAGEMENT.  MRS. WESTON WAS CONVINCED THAT SUCH CONVERSATION
MUST BE THE GREATEST RELIEF TO HER COMPANION, PENT UP WITHIN HER OWN
MIND AS EVERY THING HAD SO LONG BEEN, AND WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED
WITH ALL THAT SHE HAD SAID ON THE SUBJECT.

"ON THE MISERY OF WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED, DURING THE CONCEALMENT
OF SO MANY MONTHS," CONTINUED MRS. WESTON, "SHE WAS ENERGETIC.
THIS WAS ONE OF HER EXPRESSIONS.  `I WILL NOT SAY, THAT SINCE I
ENTERED INTO THE ENGAGEMENT I HAVE NOT HAD SOME HAPPY MOMENTS; BUT I
CAN SAY, THAT I HAVE NEVER KNOWN THE BLESSING OF ONE TRANQUIL HOUR:'--
AND THE QUIVERING LIP, EMMA, WHICH UTTERED IT, WAS AN ATTESTATION
THAT I FELT AT MY HEART."

"POOR GIRL!" SAID EMMA.  "SHE THINKS HERSELF WRONG, THEN, FOR HAVING
CONSENTED TO A PRIVATE ENGAGEMENT?"

"WRONG!  NO ONE, I BELIEVE, CAN BLAME HER MORE THAN SHE IS DISPOSED
TO BLAME HERSELF.  `THE CONSEQUENCE,' SAID SHE, `HAS BEEN A STATE
OF PERPETUAL SUFFERING TO ME; AND SO IT OUGHT.  BUT AFTER ALL THE
PUNISHMENT THAT MISCONDUCT CAN BRING, IT IS STILL NOT LESS MISCONDUCT.
PAIN IS NO EXPIATION.  I NEVER CAN BE BLAMELESS.  I HAVE BEEN ACTING
CONTRARY TO ALL MY SENSE OF RIGHT; AND THE FORTUNATE TURN THAT EVERY
THING HAS TAKEN, AND THE KINDNESS I AM NOW RECEIVING, IS WHAT MY
CONSCIENCE TELLS ME OUGHT NOT TO BE.'  `DO NOT IMAGINE, MADAM,'
SHE CONTINUED, `THAT I WAS TAUGHT WRONG.  DO NOT LET ANY REFLECTION
FALL ON THE PRINCIPLES OR THE CARE OF THE FRIENDS WHO BROUGHT
ME UP.  THE ERROR HAS BEEN ALL MY OWN; AND I DO ASSURE YOU THAT,
WITH ALL THE EXCUSE THAT PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES MAY APPEAR TO GIVE,
I SHALL YET DREAD MAKING THE STORY KNOWN TO COLONEL CAMPBELL.'"

"POOR GIRL!" SAID EMMA AGAIN.  "SHE LOVES HIM THEN EXCESSIVELY,
I SUPPOSE.  IT MUST HAVE BEEN FROM ATTACHMENT ONLY, THAT SHE COULD
BE LED TO FORM THE ENGAGEMENT.  HER AFFECTION MUST HAVE OVERPOWERED
HER JUDGMENT."

"YES, I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HER BEING EXTREMELY ATTACHED TO HIM."

"I AM AFRAID," RETURNED EMMA, SIGHING, "THAT I MUST OFTEN HAVE
CONTRIBUTED TO MAKE HER UNHAPPY."

"ON YOUR SIDE, MY LOVE, IT WAS VERY INNOCENTLY DONE.  BUT SHE
PROBABLY HAD SOMETHING OF THAT IN HER THOUGHTS, WHEN ALLUDING
TO THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH HE HAD GIVEN US HINTS OF BEFORE.
ONE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EVIL SHE HAD INVOLVED HERSELF IN,"
SHE SAID, "WAS THAT OF MAKING HER _UNREASONABLE_.  THE CONSCIOUSNESS
OF HAVING DONE AMISS, HAD EXPOSED HER TO A THOUSAND INQUIETUDES,
AND MADE HER CAPTIOUS AND IRRITABLE TO A DEGREE THAT MUST HAVE BEEN--
THAT HAD BEEN--HARD FOR HIM TO BEAR.  `I DID NOT MAKE THE ALLOWANCES,'
SAID SHE, `WHICH I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE, FOR HIS TEMPER AND SPIRITS--
HIS DELIGHTFUL SPIRITS, AND THAT GAIETY, THAT PLAYFULNESS
OF DISPOSITION, WHICH, UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD, I AM SURE,
HAVE BEEN AS CONSTANTLY BEWITCHING TO ME, AS THEY WERE AT FIRST.'
SHE THEN BEGAN TO SPEAK OF YOU, AND OF THE GREAT KINDNESS YOU
HAD SHEWN HER DURING HER ILLNESS; AND WITH A BLUSH WHICH SHEWED ME
HOW IT WAS ALL CONNECTED, DESIRED ME, WHENEVER I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY,
TO THANK YOU--I COULD NOT THANK YOU TOO MUCH--FOR EVERY WISH AND
EVERY ENDEAVOUR TO DO HER GOOD.  SHE WAS SENSIBLE THAT YOU HAD NEVER
RECEIVED ANY PROPER ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM HERSELF."

"IF I DID NOT KNOW HER TO BE HAPPY NOW," SAID EMMA, SERIOUSLY,
"WHICH, IN SPITE OF EVERY LITTLE DRAWBACK FROM HER SCRUPULOUS
CONSCIENCE, SHE MUST BE, I COULD NOT BEAR THESE THANKS;--FOR, OH!
MRS. WESTON, IF THERE WERE AN ACCOUNT DRAWN UP OF THE EVIL
AND THE GOOD I HAVE DONE MISS FAIRFAX!--WELL (CHECKING HERSELF,
AND TRYING TO BE MORE LIVELY), THIS IS ALL TO BE FORGOTTEN.
YOU ARE VERY KIND TO BRING ME THESE INTERESTING PARTICULARS.
THEY SHEW HER TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE.  I AM SURE SHE IS VERY GOOD--
I HOPE SHE WILL BE VERY HAPPY.  IT IS FIT THAT THE FORTUNE
SHOULD BE ON HIS SIDE, FOR I THINK THE MERIT WILL BE ALL ON HERS."

SUCH A CONCLUSION COULD NOT PASS UNANSWERED BY MRS. WESTON.
SHE THOUGHT WELL OF FRANK IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT; AND, WHAT WAS MORE,
SHE LOVED HIM VERY MUCH, AND HER DEFENCE WAS, THEREFORE, EARNEST.
SHE TALKED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF REASON, AND AT LEAST EQUAL AFFECTION--
BUT SHE HAD TOO MUCH TO URGE FOR EMMA'S ATTENTION; IT WAS SOON GONE
TO BRUNSWICK SQUARE OR TO DONWELL; SHE FORGOT TO ATTEMPT TO LISTEN;
AND WHEN MRS. WESTON ENDED WITH, "WE HAVE NOT YET HAD THE LETTER
WE ARE SO ANXIOUS FOR, YOU KNOW, BUT I HOPE IT WILL SOON COME,"
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE BEFORE SHE ANSWERED, AND AT LAST OBLIGED
TO ANSWER AT RANDOM, BEFORE SHE COULD AT ALL RECOLLECT WHAT LETTER IT
WAS WHICH THEY WERE SO ANXIOUS FOR.

"ARE YOU WELL, MY EMMA?" WAS MRS. WESTON'S PARTING QUESTION.

"OH! PERFECTLY.  I AM ALWAYS WELL, YOU KNOW.  BE SURE TO GIVE ME
INTELLIGENCE OF THE LETTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."

MRS. WESTON'S COMMUNICATIONS FURNISHED EMMA WITH MORE FOOD FOR
UNPLEASANT REFLECTION, BY INCREASING HER ESTEEM AND COMPASSION,
AND HER SENSE OF PAST INJUSTICE TOWARDS MISS FAIRFAX.  SHE BITTERLY
REGRETTED NOT HAVING SOUGHT A CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER, AND BLUSHED
FOR THE ENVIOUS FEELINGS WHICH HAD CERTAINLY BEEN, IN SOME MEASURE,
THE CAUSE.  HAD SHE FOLLOWED MR. KNIGHTLEY'S KNOWN WISHES, IN PAYING
THAT ATTENTION TO MISS FAIRFAX, WHICH WAS EVERY WAY HER DUE; HAD SHE
TRIED TO KNOW HER BETTER; HAD SHE DONE HER PART TOWARDS INTIMACY;
HAD SHE ENDEAVOURED TO FIND A FRIEND THERE INSTEAD OF IN HARRIET SMITH;
SHE MUST, IN ALL PROBABILITY, HAVE BEEN SPARED FROM EVERY PAIN
WHICH PRESSED ON HER NOW.--BIRTH, ABILITIES, AND EDUCATION,
HAD BEEN EQUALLY MARKING ONE AS AN ASSOCIATE FOR HER, TO BE RECEIVED
WITH GRATITUDE; AND THE OTHER--WHAT WAS SHE?--SUPPOSING EVEN THAT
THEY HAD NEVER BECOME INTIMATE FRIENDS; THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN
ADMITTED INTO MISS FAIRFAX'S CONFIDENCE ON THIS IMPORTANT MATTER--
WHICH WAS MOST PROBABLE--STILL, IN KNOWING HER AS SHE OUGHT,
AND AS SHE MIGHT, SHE MUST HAVE BEEN PRESERVED FROM THE ABOMINABLE
SUSPICIONS OF AN IMPROPER ATTACHMENT TO MR. DIXON, WHICH SHE HAD
NOT ONLY SO FOOLISHLY FASHIONED AND HARBOURED HERSELF, BUT HAD SO
UNPARDONABLY IMPARTED; AN IDEA WHICH SHE GREATLY FEARED HAD BEEN MADE
A SUBJECT OF MATERIAL DISTRESS TO THE DELICACY OF JANE'S FEELINGS,
BY THE LEVITY OR CARELESSNESS OF FRANK CHURCHILL'S.  OF ALL THE SOURCES
OF EVIL SURROUNDING THE FORMER, SINCE HER COMING TO HIGHBURY,
SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT SHE MUST HERSELF HAVE BEEN THE WORST.
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A PERPETUAL ENEMY.  THEY NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN
ALL THREE TOGETHER, WITHOUT HER HAVING STABBED JANE FAIRFAX'S PEACE
IN A THOUSAND INSTANCES; AND ON BOX HILL, PERHAPS, IT HAD BEEN
THE AGONY OF A MIND THAT WOULD BEAR NO MORE.

THE EVENING OF THIS DAY WAS VERY LONG, AND MELANCHOLY, AT HARTFIELD.
THE WEATHER ADDED WHAT IT COULD OF GLOOM.  A COLD STORMY RAIN SET IN,
AND NOTHING OF JULY APPEARED BUT IN THE TREES AND SHRUBS, WHICH THE
WIND WAS DESPOILING, AND THE LENGTH OF THE DAY, WHICH ONLY MADE
SUCH CRUEL SIGHTS THE LONGER VISIBLE.

THE WEATHER AFFECTED MR. WOODHOUSE, AND HE COULD ONLY BE KEPT TOLERABLY
COMFORTABLE BY ALMOST CEASELESS ATTENTION ON HIS DAUGHTER'S SIDE,
AND BY EXERTIONS WHICH HAD NEVER COST HER HALF SO MUCH BEFORE.
IT REMINDED HER OF THEIR FIRST FORLORN TETE-A-TETE, ON THE EVENING
OF MRS. WESTON'S WEDDING-DAY; BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD WALKED
IN THEN, SOON AFTER TEA, AND DISSIPATED EVERY MELANCHOLY FANCY.
ALAS! SUCH DELIGHTFUL PROOFS OF HARTFIELD'S ATTRACTION, AS THOSE
SORT OF VISITS CONVEYED, MIGHT SHORTLY BE OVER.  THE PICTURE WHICH
SHE HAD THEN DRAWN OF THE PRIVATIONS OF THE APPROACHING WINTER,
HAD PROVED ERRONEOUS; NO FRIENDS HAD DESERTED THEM, NO PLEASURES
HAD BEEN LOST.--BUT HER PRESENT FOREBODINGS SHE FEARED WOULD
EXPERIENCE NO SIMILAR CONTRADICTION.  THE PROSPECT BEFORE HER NOW,
WAS THREATENING TO A DEGREE THAT COULD NOT BE ENTIRELY DISPELLED--
THAT MIGHT NOT BE EVEN PARTIALLY BRIGHTENED.  IF ALL TOOK PLACE
THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE AMONG THE CIRCLE OF HER FRIENDS, HARTFIELD MUST
BE COMPARATIVELY DESERTED; AND SHE LEFT TO CHEER HER FATHER WITH THE
SPIRITS ONLY OF RUINED HAPPINESS.

THE CHILD TO BE BORN AT RANDALLS MUST BE A TIE THERE EVEN DEARER
THAN HERSELF; AND MRS. WESTON'S HEART AND TIME WOULD BE OCCUPIED
BY IT.  THEY SHOULD LOSE HER; AND, PROBABLY, IN GREAT MEASURE,
HER HUSBAND ALSO.--FRANK CHURCHILL WOULD RETURN AMONG THEM NO MORE;
AND MISS FAIRFAX, IT WAS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE, WOULD SOON CEASE
TO BELONG TO HIGHBURY.  THEY WOULD BE MARRIED, AND SETTLED EITHER
AT OR NEAR ENSCOMBE.  ALL THAT WERE GOOD WOULD BE WITHDRAWN; AND IF
TO THESE LOSSES, THE LOSS OF DONWELL WERE TO BE ADDED, WHAT WOULD
REMAIN OF CHEERFUL OR OF RATIONAL SOCIETY WITHIN THEIR REACH?
MR. KNIGHTLEY TO BE NO LONGER COMING THERE FOR HIS EVENING COMFORT!--
NO LONGER WALKING IN AT ALL HOURS, AS IF EVER WILLING TO CHANGE
HIS OWN HOME FOR THEIR'S!--HOW WAS IT TO BE ENDURED?  AND IF HE WERE
TO BE LOST TO THEM FOR HARRIET'S SAKE; IF HE WERE TO BE THOUGHT
OF HEREAFTER, AS FINDING IN HARRIET'S SOCIETY ALL THAT HE WANTED;
IF HARRIET WERE TO BE THE CHOSEN, THE FIRST, THE DEAREST, THE FRIEND,
THE WIFE TO WHOM HE LOOKED FOR ALL THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE;
WHAT COULD BE INCREASING EMMA'S WRETCHEDNESS BUT THE REFLECTION NEVER FAR
DISTANT FROM HER MIND, THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL HER OWN WORK?

WHEN IT CAME TO SUCH A PITCH AS THIS, SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO REFRAIN
FROM A START, OR A HEAVY SIGH, OR EVEN FROM WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM
FOR A FEW SECONDS--AND THE ONLY SOURCE WHENCE ANY THING LIKE CONSOLATION
OR COMPOSURE COULD BE DRAWN, WAS IN THE RESOLUTION OF HER OWN
BETTER CONDUCT, AND THE HOPE THAT, HOWEVER INFERIOR IN SPIRIT AND
GAIETY MIGHT BE THE FOLLOWING AND EVERY FUTURE WINTER OF HER LIFE
TO THE PAST, IT WOULD YET FIND HER MORE RATIONAL, MORE ACQUAINTED
WITH HERSELF, AND LEAVE HER LESS TO REGRET WHEN IT WERE GONE.



CHAPTER XIII


THE WEATHER CONTINUED MUCH THE SAME ALL THE FOLLOWING MORNING;
AND THE SAME LONELINESS, AND THE SAME MELANCHOLY, SEEMED TO
REIGN AT HARTFIELD--BUT IN THE AFTERNOON IT CLEARED; THE WIND
CHANGED INTO A SOFTER QUARTER; THE CLOUDS WERE CARRIED OFF;
THE SUN APPEARED; IT WAS SUMMER AGAIN.  WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS
WHICH SUCH A TRANSITION GIVES, EMMA RESOLVED TO BE OUT OF DOORS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  NEVER HAD THE EXQUISITE SIGHT, SMELL,
SENSATION OF NATURE, TRANQUIL, WARM, AND BRILLIANT AFTER A STORM,
BEEN MORE ATTRACTIVE TO HER.  SHE LONGED FOR THE SERENITY THEY MIGHT
GRADUALLY INTRODUCE; AND ON MR. PERRY'S COMING IN SOON AFTER DINNER,
WITH A DISENGAGED HOUR TO GIVE HER FATHER, SHE LOST NO TIME ILL
HURRYING INTO THE SHRUBBERY.--THERE, WITH SPIRITS FRESHENED,
AND THOUGHTS A LITTLE RELIEVED, SHE HAD TAKEN A FEW TURNS, WHEN SHE
SAW MR. KNIGHTLEY PASSING THROUGH THE GARDEN DOOR, AND COMING
TOWARDS HER.--IT WAS THE FIRST INTIMATION OF HIS BEING RETURNED
FROM LONDON.  SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OF HIM THE MOMENT BEFORE,
AS UNQUESTIONABLY SIXTEEN MILES DISTANT.--THERE WAS TIME ONLY FOR
THE QUICKEST ARRANGEMENT OF MIND.  SHE MUST BE COLLECTED AND CALM.
IN HALF A MINUTE THEY WERE TOGETHER.  THE "HOW D'YE DO'S" WERE QUIET
AND CONSTRAINED ON EACH SIDE.  SHE ASKED AFTER THEIR MUTUAL FRIENDS;
THEY WERE ALL WELL.--WHEN HAD HE LEFT THEM?--ONLY THAT MORNING.
HE MUST HAVE HAD A WET RIDE.--YES.--HE MEANT TO WALK WITH HER,
SHE FOUND.  "HE HAD JUST LOOKED INTO THE DINING-ROOM, AND AS HE
WAS NOT WANTED THERE, PREFERRED BEING OUT OF DOORS."--SHE THOUGHT
HE NEITHER LOOKED NOR SPOKE CHEERFULLY; AND THE FIRST POSSIBLE
CAUSE FOR IT, SUGGESTED BY HER FEARS, WAS, THAT HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN
COMMUNICATING HIS PLANS TO HIS BROTHER, AND WAS PAINED BY THE MANNER
IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN RECEIVED.

THEY WALKED TOGETHER.  HE WAS SILENT.  SHE THOUGHT HE WAS OFTEN
LOOKING AT HER, AND TRYING FOR A FULLER VIEW OF HER FACE THAN IT
SUITED HER TO GIVE.  AND THIS BELIEF PRODUCED ANOTHER DREAD.
PERHAPS HE WANTED TO SPEAK TO HER, OF HIS ATTACHMENT TO HARRIET;
HE MIGHT BE WATCHING FOR ENCOURAGEMENT TO BEGIN.--SHE DID NOT,
COULD NOT, FEEL EQUAL TO LEAD THE WAY TO ANY SUCH SUBJECT.
HE MUST DO IT ALL HIMSELF.  YET SHE COULD NOT BEAR THIS SILENCE.
WITH HIM IT WAS MOST UNNATURAL.  SHE CONSIDERED--RESOLVED--AND, TRYING
TO SMILE, BEGAN--

"YOU HAVE SOME NEWS TO HEAR, NOW YOU ARE COME BACK, THAT WILL RATHER
SURPRIZE YOU."

"HAVE I?" SAID HE QUIETLY, AND LOOKING AT HER; "OF WHAT NATURE?"

"OH! THE BEST NATURE IN THE WORLD--A WEDDING."

AFTER WAITING A MOMENT, AS IF TO BE SURE SHE INTENDED TO SAY NO MORE,
HE REPLIED,

"IF YOU MEAN MISS FAIRFAX AND FRANK CHURCHILL, I HAVE HEARD
THAT ALREADY."

"HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?" CRIED EMMA, TURNING HER GLOWING CHEEKS
TOWARDS HIM; FOR, WHILE SHE SPOKE, IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT HE
MIGHT HAVE CALLED AT MRS. GODDARD'S IN HIS WAY.

"I HAD A FEW LINES ON PARISH BUSINESS FROM MR. WESTON THIS MORNING,
AND AT THE END OF THEM HE GAVE ME A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED."

EMMA WAS QUITE RELIEVED, AND COULD PRESENTLY SAY, WITH A LITTLE
MORE COMPOSURE,

"_YOU_ PROBABLY HAVE BEEN LESS SURPRIZED THAN ANY OF US, FOR YOU HAVE
HAD YOUR SUSPICIONS.--I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THAT YOU ONCE TRIED TO GIVE
ME A CAUTION.--I WISH I HAD ATTENDED TO IT--BUT--(WITH A SINKING
VOICE AND A HEAVY SIGH) I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DOOMED TO BLINDNESS."

FOR A MOMENT OR TWO NOTHING WAS SAID, AND SHE WAS UNSUSPICIOUS
OF HAVING EXCITED ANY PARTICULAR INTEREST, TILL SHE FOUND HER ARM
DRAWN WITHIN HIS, AND PRESSED AGAINST HIS HEART, AND HEARD HIM
THUS SAYING, IN A TONE OF GREAT SENSIBILITY, SPEAKING LOW,

"TIME, MY DEAREST EMMA, TIME WILL HEAL THE WOUND.--YOUR OWN
EXCELLENT SENSE--YOUR EXERTIONS FOR YOUR FATHER'S SAKE--I KNOW
YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOURSELF--."  HER ARM WAS PRESSED AGAIN,
AS HE ADDED, IN A MORE BROKEN AND SUBDUED ACCENT, "THE FEELINGS
OF THE WARMEST FRIENDSHIP--INDIGNATION--ABOMINABLE SCOUNDREL!"--
AND IN A LOUDER, STEADIER TONE, HE CONCLUDED WITH, "HE WILL SOON
BE GONE.  THEY WILL SOON BE IN YORKSHIRE.  I AM SORRY FOR _HER_.
SHE DESERVES A BETTER FATE."

EMMA UNDERSTOOD HIM; AND AS SOON AS SHE COULD RECOVER FROM THE
FLUTTER OF PLEASURE, EXCITED BY SUCH TENDER CONSIDERATION, REPLIED,

"YOU ARE VERY KIND--BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN--AND I MUST SET YOU RIGHT.--
I AM NOT IN WANT OF THAT SORT OF COMPASSION.  MY BLINDNESS TO WHAT
WAS GOING ON, LED ME TO ACT BY THEM IN A WAY THAT I MUST ALWAYS
BE ASHAMED OF, AND I WAS VERY FOOLISHLY TEMPTED TO SAY AND DO MANY
THINGS WHICH MAY WELL LAY ME OPEN TO UNPLEASANT CONJECTURES, BUT I
HAVE NO OTHER REASON TO REGRET THAT I WAS NOT IN THE SECRET EARLIER."

"EMMA!" CRIED HE, LOOKING EAGERLY AT HER, "ARE YOU, INDEED?"--
BUT CHECKING HIMSELF--"NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND YOU--FORGIVE ME--I AM
PLEASED THAT YOU CAN SAY EVEN SO MUCH.--HE IS NO OBJECT OF REGRET,
INDEED! AND IT WILL NOT BE VERY LONG, I HOPE, BEFORE THAT BECOMES
THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF MORE THAN YOUR REASON.--FORTUNATE THAT YOUR
AFFECTIONS WERE NOT FARTHER ENTANGLED!--I COULD NEVER, I CONFESS,
FROM YOUR MANNERS, ASSURE MYSELF AS TO THE DEGREE OF WHAT YOU FELT--
I COULD ONLY BE CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS A PREFERENCE--AND A PREFERENCE
WHICH I NEVER BELIEVED HIM TO DESERVE.--HE IS A DISGRACE TO THE NAME
OF MAN.--AND IS HE TO BE REWARDED WITH THAT SWEET YOUNG WOMAN?--
JANE, JANE, YOU WILL BE A MISERABLE CREATURE."

"MR. KNIGHTLEY," SAID EMMA, TRYING TO BE LIVELY, BUT REALLY CONFUSED--
"I AM IN A VERY EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION.  I CANNOT LET YOU CONTINUE IN
YOUR ERROR; AND YET, PERHAPS, SINCE MY MANNERS GAVE SUCH AN IMPRESSION,
I HAVE AS MUCH REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF CONFESSING THAT I NEVER HAVE
BEEN AT ALL ATTACHED TO THE PERSON WE ARE SPEAKING OF, AS IT MIGHT
BE NATURAL FOR A WOMAN TO FEEL IN CONFESSING EXACTLY THE REVERSE.--
BUT I NEVER HAVE."

HE LISTENED IN PERFECT SILENCE.  SHE WISHED HIM TO SPEAK, BUT HE
WOULD NOT.  SHE SUPPOSED SHE MUST SAY MORE BEFORE SHE WERE ENTITLED
TO HIS CLEMENCY; BUT IT WAS A HARD CASE TO BE OBLIGED STILL TO LOWER
HERSELF IN HIS OPINION.  SHE WENT ON, HOWEVER.

"I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY FOR MY OWN CONDUCT.--I WAS TEMPTED
BY HIS ATTENTIONS, AND ALLOWED MYSELF TO APPEAR PLEASED.--
AN OLD STORY, PROBABLY--A COMMON CASE--AND NO MORE THAN HAS HAPPENED
TO HUNDREDS OF MY SEX BEFORE; AND YET IT MAY NOT BE THE MORE EXCUSABLE
IN ONE WHO SETS UP AS I DO FOR UNDERSTANDING.  MANY CIRCUMSTANCES
ASSISTED THE TEMPTATION.  HE WAS THE SON OF MR. WESTON--HE WAS
CONTINUALLY HERE--I ALWAYS FOUND HIM VERY PLEASANT--AND, IN SHORT,
FOR (WITH A SIGH) LET ME SWELL OUT THE CAUSES EVER SO INGENIOUSLY,
THEY ALL CENTRE IN THIS AT LAST--MY VANITY WAS FLATTERED, AND I
ALLOWED HIS ATTENTIONS.  LATTERLY, HOWEVER--FOR SOME TIME, INDEED--
I HAVE HAD NO IDEA OF THEIR MEANING ANY THING.--I THOUGHT THEM
A HABIT, A TRICK, NOTHING THAT CALLED FOR SERIOUSNESS ON MY SIDE.
HE HAS IMPOSED ON ME, BUT HE HAS NOT INJURED ME.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN
ATTACHED TO HIM.  AND NOW I CAN TOLERABLY COMPREHEND HIS BEHAVIOUR.
HE NEVER WISHED TO ATTACH ME.  IT WAS MERELY A BLIND TO CONCEAL
HIS REAL SITUATION WITH ANOTHER.--IT WAS HIS OBJECT TO BLIND
ALL ABOUT HIM; AND NO ONE, I AM SURE, COULD BE MORE EFFECTUALLY
BLINDED THAN MYSELF--EXCEPT THAT I WAS _NOT_ BLINDED--THAT IT WAS MY
GOOD FORTUNE--THAT, IN SHORT, I WAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER SAFE FROM HIM."

SHE HAD HOPED FOR AN ANSWER HERE--FOR A FEW WORDS TO SAY THAT HER
CONDUCT WAS AT LEAST INTELLIGIBLE; BUT HE WAS SILENT; AND, AS FAR
AS SHE COULD JUDGE, DEEP IN THOUGHT.  AT LAST, AND TOLERABLY
IN HIS USUAL TONE, HE SAID,

"I HAVE NEVER HAD A HIGH OPINION OF FRANK CHURCHILL.--I CAN SUPPOSE,
HOWEVER, THAT I MAY HAVE UNDERRATED HIM.  MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH
HIM HAS BEEN BUT TRIFLING.--AND EVEN IF I HAVE NOT UNDERRATED
HIM HITHERTO, HE MAY YET TURN OUT WELL.--WITH SUCH A WOMAN HE HAS
A CHANCE.--I HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR WISHING HIM ILL--AND FOR HER SAKE,
WHOSE HAPPINESS WILL BE INVOLVED IN HIS GOOD CHARACTER AND CONDUCT,
I SHALL CERTAINLY WISH HIM WELL."

"I HAVE NO DOUBT OF THEIR BEING HAPPY TOGETHER," SAID EMMA;
"I BELIEVE THEM TO BE VERY MUTUALLY AND VERY SINCERELY ATTACHED."

"HE IS A MOST FORTUNATE MAN!" RETURNED MR. KNIGHTLEY, WITH ENERGY.
"SO EARLY IN LIFE--AT THREE-AND-TWENTY--A PERIOD WHEN, IF A MAN
CHUSES A WIFE, HE GENERALLY CHUSES ILL.  AT THREE-AND-TWENTY
TO HAVE DRAWN SUCH A PRIZE!  WHAT YEARS OF FELICITY THAT MAN,
IN ALL HUMAN CALCULATION, HAS BEFORE HIM!--ASSURED OF THE LOVE OF
SUCH A WOMAN--THE DISINTERESTED LOVE, FOR JANE FAIRFAX'S CHARACTER
VOUCHES FOR HER DISINTERESTEDNESS; EVERY THING IN HIS FAVOUR,--
EQUALITY OF SITUATION--I MEAN, AS FAR AS REGARDS SOCIETY, AND ALL THE
HABITS AND MANNERS THAT ARE IMPORTANT; EQUALITY IN EVERY POINT BUT ONE--
AND THAT ONE, SINCE THE PURITY OF HER HEART IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED,
SUCH AS MUST INCREASE HIS FELICITY, FOR IT WILL BE HIS TO BESTOW THE
ONLY ADVANTAGES SHE WANTS.--A MAN WOULD ALWAYS WISH TO GIVE A WOMAN
A BETTER HOME THAN THE ONE HE TAKES HER FROM; AND HE WHO CAN DO IT,
WHERE THERE IS NO DOUBT OF _HER_ REGARD, MUST, I THINK, BE THE HAPPIEST
OF MORTALS.--FRANK CHURCHILL IS, INDEED, THE FAVOURITE OF FORTUNE.
EVERY THING TURNS OUT FOR HIS GOOD.--HE MEETS WITH A YOUNG WOMAN
AT A WATERING-PLACE, GAINS HER AFFECTION, CANNOT EVEN WEARY HER
BY NEGLIGENT TREATMENT--AND HAD HE AND ALL HIS FAMILY SOUGHT ROUND
THE WORLD FOR A PERFECT WIFE FOR HIM, THEY COULD NOT HAVE FOUND
HER SUPERIOR.--HIS AUNT IS IN THE WAY.--HIS AUNT DIES.--HE HAS
ONLY TO SPEAK.--HIS FRIENDS ARE EAGER TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS.--
HE HAD USED EVERY BODY ILL--AND THEY ARE ALL DELIGHTED TO FORGIVE HIM.--
HE IS A FORTUNATE MAN INDEED!"

"YOU SPEAK AS IF YOU ENVIED HIM."

"AND I DO ENVY HIM, EMMA.  IN ONE RESPECT HE IS THE OBJECT OF MY ENVY."

EMMA COULD SAY NO MORE.  THEY SEEMED TO BE WITHIN HALF A SENTENCE
OF HARRIET, AND HER IMMEDIATE FEELING WAS TO AVERT THE SUBJECT,
IF POSSIBLE.  SHE MADE HER PLAN; SHE WOULD SPEAK OF SOMETHING
TOTALLY DIFFERENT--THE CHILDREN IN BRUNSWICK SQUARE; AND SHE
ONLY WAITED FOR BREATH TO BEGIN, WHEN MR. KNIGHTLEY STARTLED HER,
BY SAYING,

"YOU WILL NOT ASK ME WHAT IS THE POINT OF ENVY.--YOU ARE DETERMINED,
I SEE, TO HAVE NO CURIOSITY.--YOU ARE WISE--BUT _I_ CANNOT BE WISE.
EMMA, I MUST TELL YOU WHAT YOU WILL NOT ASK, THOUGH I MAY WISH IT
UNSAID THE NEXT MOMENT."

"OH! THEN, DON'T SPEAK IT, DON'T SPEAK IT," SHE EAGERLY CRIED.
"TAKE A LITTLE TIME, CONSIDER, DO NOT COMMIT YOURSELF."

"THANK YOU," SAID HE, IN AN ACCENT OF DEEP MORTIFICATION, AND NOT
ANOTHER SYLLABLE FOLLOWED.

EMMA COULD NOT BEAR TO GIVE HIM PAIN.  HE WAS WISHING TO CONFIDE IN HER--
PERHAPS TO CONSULT HER;--COST HER WHAT IT WOULD, SHE WOULD LISTEN.
SHE MIGHT ASSIST HIS RESOLUTION, OR RECONCILE HIM TO IT;
SHE MIGHT GIVE JUST PRAISE TO HARRIET, OR, BY REPRESENTING TO HIM
HIS OWN INDEPENDENCE, RELIEVE HIM FROM THAT STATE OF INDECISION,
WHICH MUST BE MORE INTOLERABLE THAN ANY ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH A MIND
AS HIS.--THEY HAD REACHED THE HOUSE.

"YOU ARE GOING IN, I SUPPOSE?" SAID HE.

"NO,"--REPLIED EMMA--QUITE CONFIRMED BY THE DEPRESSED MANNER
IN WHICH HE STILL SPOKE--"I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE ANOTHER TURN.
MR. PERRY IS NOT GONE."  AND, AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW STEPS, SHE ADDED--
"I STOPPED YOU UNGRACIOUSLY, JUST NOW, MR. KNIGHTLEY, AND, I AM AFRAID,
GAVE YOU PAIN.--BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY WISH TO SPEAK OPENLY TO ME
AS A FRIEND, OR TO ASK MY OPINION OF ANY THING THAT YOU MAY HAVE
IN CONTEMPLATION--AS A FRIEND, INDEED, YOU MAY COMMAND ME.--I WILL
HEAR WHATEVER YOU LIKE.  I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT I THINK."

"AS A FRIEND!"--REPEATED MR. KNIGHTLEY.--"EMMA, THAT I FEAR IS
A WORD--NO, I HAVE NO WISH--STAY, YES, WHY SHOULD I HESITATE?--
I HAVE GONE TOO FAR ALREADY FOR CONCEALMENT.--EMMA, I ACCEPT YOUR OFFER--
EXTRAORDINARY AS IT MAY SEEM, I ACCEPT IT, AND REFER MYSELF TO YOU
AS A FRIEND.--TELL ME, THEN, HAVE I NO CHANCE OF EVER SUCCEEDING?"

HE STOPPED IN HIS EARNESTNESS TO LOOK THE QUESTION, AND THE EXPRESSION
OF HIS EYES OVERPOWERED HER.

"MY DEAREST EMMA," SAID HE, "FOR DEAREST YOU WILL ALWAYS BE,
WHATEVER THE EVENT OF THIS HOUR'S CONVERSATION, MY DEAREST,
MOST BELOVED EMMA--TELL ME AT ONCE.  SAY `NO,' IF IT IS TO BE SAID."--
SHE COULD REALLY SAY NOTHING.--"YOU ARE SILENT," HE CRIED,
WITH GREAT ANIMATION; "ABSOLUTELY SILENT! AT PRESENT I ASK NO MORE."

EMMA WAS ALMOST READY TO SINK UNDER THE AGITATION OF THIS MOMENT.
THE DREAD OF BEING AWAKENED FROM THE HAPPIEST DREAM, WAS PERHAPS
THE MOST PROMINENT FEELING.

"I CANNOT MAKE SPEECHES, EMMA:"  HE SOON RESUMED; AND IN A TONE
OF SUCH SINCERE, DECIDED, INTELLIGIBLE TENDERNESS AS WAS
TOLERABLY CONVINCING.--"IF I LOVED YOU LESS, I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE.  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I AM.--YOU HEAR NOTHING
BUT TRUTH FROM ME.--I HAVE BLAMED YOU, AND LECTURED YOU, AND YOU
HAVE BORNE IT AS NO OTHER WOMAN IN ENGLAND WOULD HAVE BORNE IT.--
BEAR WITH THE TRUTHS I WOULD TELL YOU NOW, DEAREST EMMA, AS WELL AS
YOU HAVE BORNE WITH THEM.  THE MANNER, PERHAPS, MAY HAVE AS LITTLE
TO RECOMMEND THEM.  GOD KNOWS, I HAVE BEEN A VERY INDIFFERENT LOVER.--
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND ME.--YES, YOU SEE, YOU UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS--
AND WILL RETURN THEM IF YOU CAN.  AT PRESENT, I ASK ONLY TO HEAR,
ONCE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE."

WHILE HE SPOKE, EMMA'S MIND WAS MOST BUSY, AND, WITH ALL THE WONDERFUL
VELOCITY OF THOUGHT, HAD BEEN ABLE--AND YET WITHOUT LOSING A WORD--
TO CATCH AND COMPREHEND THE EXACT TRUTH OF THE WHOLE; TO SEE THAT
HARRIET'S HOPES HAD BEEN ENTIRELY GROUNDLESS, A MISTAKE, A DELUSION,
AS COMPLETE A DELUSION AS ANY OF HER OWN--THAT HARRIET WAS NOTHING;
THAT SHE WAS EVERY THING HERSELF; THAT WHAT SHE HAD BEEN SAYING
RELATIVE TO HARRIET HAD BEEN ALL TAKEN AS THE LANGUAGE OF HER
OWN FEELINGS; AND THAT HER AGITATION, HER DOUBTS, HER RELUCTANCE,
HER DISCOURAGEMENT, HAD BEEN ALL RECEIVED AS DISCOURAGEMENT
FROM HERSELF.--AND NOT ONLY WAS THERE TIME FOR THESE CONVICTIONS,
WITH ALL THEIR GLOW OF ATTENDANT HAPPINESS; THERE WAS TIME ALSO TO
REJOICE THAT HARRIET'S SECRET HAD NOT ESCAPED HER, AND TO RESOLVE
THAT IT NEED NOT, AND SHOULD NOT.--IT WAS ALL THE SERVICE SHE COULD
NOW RENDER HER POOR FRIEND; FOR AS TO ANY OF THAT HEROISM OF SENTIMENT
WHICH MIGHT HAVE PROMPTED HER TO ENTREAT HIM TO TRANSFER HIS AFFECTION
FROM HERSELF TO HARRIET, AS INFINITELY THE MOST WORTHY OF THE TWO--
OR EVEN THE MORE SIMPLE SUBLIMITY OF RESOLVING TO REFUSE HIM
AT ONCE AND FOR EVER, WITHOUT VOUCHSAFING ANY MOTIVE, BECAUSE HE
COULD NOT MARRY THEM BOTH, EMMA HAD IT NOT.  SHE FELT FOR HARRIET,
WITH PAIN AND WITH CONTRITION; BUT NO FLIGHT OF GENEROSITY RUN MAD,
OPPOSING ALL THAT COULD BE PROBABLE OR REASONABLE, ENTERED HER BRAIN.
SHE HAD LED HER FRIEND ASTRAY, AND IT WOULD BE A REPROACH TO
HER FOR EVER; BUT HER JUDGMENT WAS AS STRONG AS HER FEELINGS,
AND AS STRONG AS IT HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE, IN REPROBATING ANY SUCH
ALLIANCE FOR HIM, AS MOST UNEQUAL AND DEGRADING.  HER WAY WAS CLEAR,
THOUGH NOT QUITE SMOOTH.--SHE SPOKE THEN, ON BEING SO ENTREATED.--
WHAT DID SHE SAY?--JUST WHAT SHE OUGHT, OF COURSE.  A LADY ALWAYS DOES.--
SHE SAID ENOUGH TO SHEW THERE NEED NOT BE DESPAIR--AND TO INVITE HIM
TO SAY MORE HIMSELF.  HE _HAD_ DESPAIRED AT ONE PERIOD; HE HAD RECEIVED
SUCH AN INJUNCTION TO CAUTION AND SILENCE, AS FOR THE TIME CRUSHED
EVERY HOPE;--SHE HAD BEGUN BY REFUSING TO HEAR HIM.--THE CHANGE HAD
PERHAPS BEEN SOMEWHAT SUDDEN;--HER PROPOSAL OF TAKING ANOTHER TURN,
HER RENEWING THE CONVERSATION WHICH SHE HAD JUST PUT AN END TO,
MIGHT BE A LITTLE EXTRAORDINARY!--SHE FELT ITS INCONSISTENCY;
BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS SO OBLIGING AS TO PUT UP WITH IT, AND SEEK NO
FARTHER EXPLANATION.

SELDOM, VERY SELDOM, DOES COMPLETE TRUTH BELONG TO ANY HUMAN DISCLOSURE;
SELDOM CAN IT HAPPEN THAT SOMETHING IS NOT A LITTLE DISGUISED,
OR A LITTLE MISTAKEN; BUT WHERE, AS IN THIS CASE, THOUGH THE CONDUCT
IS MISTAKEN, THE FEELINGS ARE NOT, IT MAY NOT BE VERY MATERIAL.--
MR. KNIGHTLEY COULD NOT IMPUTE TO EMMA A MORE RELENTING HEART THAN
SHE POSSESSED, OR A HEART MORE DISPOSED TO ACCEPT OF HIS.

HE HAD, IN FACT, BEEN WHOLLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF HIS OWN INFLUENCE.
HE HAD FOLLOWED HER INTO THE SHRUBBERY WITH NO IDEA OF TRYING IT.
HE HAD COME, IN HIS ANXIETY TO SEE HOW SHE BORE FRANK CHURCHILL'S
ENGAGEMENT, WITH NO SELFISH VIEW, NO VIEW AT ALL, BUT OF ENDEAVOURING,
IF SHE ALLOWED HIM AN OPENING, TO SOOTHE OR TO COUNSEL HER.--THE REST
HAD BEEN THE WORK OF THE MOMENT, THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF WHAT HE HEARD,
ON HIS FEELINGS.  THE DELIGHTFUL ASSURANCE OF HER TOTAL INDIFFERENCE
TOWARDS FRANK CHURCHILL, OF HER HAVING A HEART COMPLETELY DISENGAGED
FROM HIM, HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO THE HOPE, THAT, IN TIME, HE MIGHT GAIN
HER AFFECTION HIMSELF;--BUT IT HAD BEEN NO PRESENT HOPE--HE HAD ONLY,
IN THE MOMENTARY CONQUEST OF EAGERNESS OVER JUDGMENT, ASPIRED TO BE
TOLD THAT SHE DID NOT FORBID HIS ATTEMPT TO ATTACH HER.--THE SUPERIOR
HOPES WHICH GRADUALLY OPENED WERE SO MUCH THE MORE ENCHANTING.--
THE AFFECTION, WHICH HE HAD BEEN ASKING TO BE ALLOWED TO CREATE,
IF HE COULD, WAS ALREADY HIS!--WITHIN HALF AN HOUR, HE HAD PASSED
FROM A THOROUGHLY DISTRESSED STATE OF MIND, TO SOMETHING SO LIKE
PERFECT HAPPINESS, THAT IT COULD BEAR NO OTHER NAME.

_HER_ CHANGE WAS EQUAL.--THIS ONE HALF-HOUR HAD GIVEN TO EACH THE
SAME PRECIOUS CERTAINTY OF BEING BELOVED, HAD CLEARED FROM EACH
THE SAME DEGREE OF IGNORANCE, JEALOUSY, OR DISTRUST.--ON HIS SIDE,
THERE HAD BEEN A LONG-STANDING JEALOUSY, OLD AS THE ARRIVAL,
OR EVEN THE EXPECTATION, OF FRANK CHURCHILL.--HE HAD BEEN IN LOVE
WITH EMMA, AND JEALOUS OF FRANK CHURCHILL, FROM ABOUT THE SAME PERIOD,
ONE SENTIMENT HAVING PROBABLY ENLIGHTENED HIM AS TO THE OTHER.
IT WAS HIS JEALOUSY OF FRANK CHURCHILL THAT HAD TAKEN HIM FROM
THE COUNTRY.--THE BOX HILL PARTY HAD DECIDED HIM ON GOING AWAY.
HE WOULD SAVE HIMSELF FROM WITNESSING AGAIN SUCH PERMITTED,
ENCOURAGED ATTENTIONS.--HE HAD GONE TO LEARN TO BE INDIFFERENT.--
BUT HE HAD GONE TO A WRONG PLACE.  THERE WAS TOO MUCH DOMESTIC
HAPPINESS IN HIS BROTHER'S HOUSE; WOMAN WORE TOO AMIABLE A FORM IN IT;
ISABELLA WAS TOO MUCH LIKE EMMA--DIFFERING ONLY IN THOSE STRIKING
INFERIORITIES, WHICH ALWAYS BROUGHT THE OTHER IN BRILLIANCY BEFORE HIM,
FOR MUCH TO HAVE BEEN DONE, EVEN HAD HIS TIME BEEN LONGER.--HE HAD
STAYED ON, HOWEVER, VIGOROUSLY, DAY AFTER DAY--TILL THIS VERY MORNING'S
POST HAD CONVEYED THE HISTORY OF JANE FAIRFAX.--THEN, WITH THE
GLADNESS WHICH MUST BE FELT, NAY, WHICH HE DID NOT SCRUPLE TO FEEL,
HAVING NEVER BELIEVED FRANK CHURCHILL TO BE AT ALL DESERVING EMMA,
WAS THERE SO MUCH FOND SOLICITUDE, SO MUCH KEEN ANXIETY FOR HER,
THAT HE COULD STAY NO LONGER.  HE HAD RIDDEN HOME THROUGH THE RAIN;
AND HAD WALKED UP DIRECTLY AFTER DINNER, TO SEE HOW THIS SWEETEST
AND BEST OF ALL CREATURES, FAULTLESS IN SPITE OF ALL HER FAULTS,
BORE THE DISCOVERY.

HE HAD FOUND HER AGITATED AND LOW.--FRANK CHURCHILL WAS A VILLAIN.--
HE HEARD HER DECLARE THAT SHE HAD NEVER LOVED HIM.  FRANK CHURCHILL'S
CHARACTER WAS NOT DESPERATE.--SHE WAS HIS OWN EMMA, BY HAND AND WORD,
WHEN THEY RETURNED INTO THE HOUSE; AND IF HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF FRANK CHURCHILL THEN, HE MIGHT HAVE DEEMED HIM A VERY GOOD SORT
OF FELLOW.



CHAPTER XIV


WHAT TOTALLY DIFFERENT FEELINGS DID EMMA TAKE BACK INTO THE HOUSE
FROM WHAT SHE HAD BROUGHT OUT!--SHE HAD THEN BEEN ONLY DARING TO HOPE
FOR A LITTLE RESPITE OF SUFFERING;--SHE WAS NOW IN AN EXQUISITE
FLUTTER OF HAPPINESS, AND SUCH HAPPINESS MOREOVER AS SHE BELIEVED
MUST STILL BE GREATER WHEN THE FLUTTER SHOULD HAVE PASSED AWAY.

THEY SAT DOWN TO TEA--THE SAME PARTY ROUND THE SAME TABLE--
HOW OFTEN IT HAD BEEN COLLECTED!--AND HOW OFTEN HAD HER EYES FALLEN
ON THE SAME SHRUBS IN THE LAWN, AND OBSERVED THE SAME BEAUTIFUL
EFFECT OF THE WESTERN SUN!--BUT NEVER IN SUCH A STATE OF SPIRITS,
NEVER IN ANY THING LIKE IT; AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT SHE COULD
SUMMON ENOUGH OF HER USUAL SELF TO BE THE ATTENTIVE LADY OF THE HOUSE,
OR EVEN THE ATTENTIVE DAUGHTER.

POOR MR. WOODHOUSE LITTLE SUSPECTED WHAT WAS PLOTTING AGAINST HIM
IN THE BREAST OF THAT MAN WHOM HE WAS SO CORDIALLY WELCOMING, AND SO
ANXIOUSLY HOPING MIGHT NOT HAVE TAKEN COLD FROM HIS RIDE.--COULD HE
HAVE SEEN THE HEART, HE WOULD HAVE CARED VERY LITTLE FOR THE LUNGS;
BUT WITHOUT THE MOST DISTANT IMAGINATION OF THE IMPENDING EVIL,
WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PERCEPTION OF ANY THING EXTRAORDINARY IN
THE LOOKS OR WAYS OF EITHER, HE REPEATED TO THEM VERY COMFORTABLY
ALL THE ARTICLES OF NEWS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM MR. PERRY, AND TALKED
ON WITH MUCH SELF-CONTENTMENT, TOTALLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF WHAT THEY
COULD HAVE TOLD HIM IN RETURN.

AS LONG AS MR. KNIGHTLEY REMAINED WITH THEM, EMMA'S FEVER CONTINUED;
BUT WHEN HE WAS GONE, SHE BEGAN TO BE A LITTLE TRANQUILLISED
AND SUBDUED--AND IN THE COURSE OF THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT, WHICH WAS
THE TAX FOR SUCH AN EVENING, SHE FOUND ONE OR TWO SUCH VERY SERIOUS
POINTS TO CONSIDER, AS MADE HER FEEL, THAT EVEN HER HAPPINESS
MUST HAVE SOME ALLOY.  HER FATHER--AND HARRIET.  SHE COULD NOT BE
ALONE WITHOUT FEELING THE FULL WEIGHT OF THEIR SEPARATE CLAIMS;
AND HOW TO GUARD THE COMFORT OF BOTH TO THE UTMOST, WAS THE QUESTION.
WITH RESPECT TO HER FATHER, IT WAS A QUESTION SOON ANSWERED.
SHE HARDLY KNEW YET WHAT MR. KNIGHTLEY WOULD ASK; BUT A VERY SHORT
PARLEY WITH HER OWN HEART PRODUCED THE MOST SOLEMN RESOLUTION
OF NEVER QUITTING HER FATHER.--SHE EVEN WEPT OVER THE IDEA OF IT,
AS A SIN OF THOUGHT.  WHILE HE LIVED, IT MUST BE ONLY AN ENGAGEMENT;
BUT SHE FLATTERED HERSELF, THAT IF DIVESTED OF THE DANGER OF
DRAWING HER AWAY, IT MIGHT BECOME AN INCREASE OF COMFORT TO HIM.--
HOW TO DO HER BEST BY HARRIET, WAS OF MORE DIFFICULT DECISION;--
HOW TO SPARE HER FROM ANY UNNECESSARY PAIN; HOW TO MAKE
HER ANY POSSIBLE ATONEMENT; HOW TO APPEAR LEAST HER ENEMY?--
ON THESE SUBJECTS, HER PERPLEXITY AND DISTRESS WERE VERY GREAT--
AND HER MIND HAD TO PASS AGAIN AND AGAIN THROUGH EVERY BITTER
REPROACH AND SORROWFUL REGRET THAT HAD EVER SURROUNDED IT.--
SHE COULD ONLY RESOLVE AT LAST, THAT SHE WOULD STILL AVOID A
MEETING WITH HER, AND COMMUNICATE ALL THAT NEED BE TOLD BY LETTER;
THAT IT WOULD BE INEXPRESSIBLY DESIRABLE TO HAVE HER REMOVED JUST
NOW FOR A TIME FROM HIGHBURY, AND--INDULGING IN ONE SCHEME MORE--
NEARLY RESOLVE, THAT IT MIGHT BE PRACTICABLE TO GET AN INVITATION
FOR HER TO BRUNSWICK SQUARE.--ISABELLA HAD BEEN PLEASED WITH HARRIET;
AND A FEW WEEKS SPENT IN LONDON MUST GIVE HER SOME AMUSEMENT.--
SHE DID NOT THINK IT IN HARRIET'S NATURE TO ESCAPE BEING BENEFITED
BY NOVELTY AND VARIETY, BY THE STREETS, THE SHOPS, AND THE CHILDREN.--
AT ANY RATE, IT WOULD BE A PROOF OF ATTENTION AND KINDNESS IN HERSELF,
FROM WHOM EVERY THING WAS DUE; A SEPARATION FOR THE PRESENT; AN AVERTING
OF THE EVIL DAY, WHEN THEY MUST ALL BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

SHE ROSE EARLY, AND WROTE HER LETTER TO HARRIET; AN EMPLOYMENT
WHICH LEFT HER SO VERY SERIOUS, SO NEARLY SAD, THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY,
IN WALKING UP TO HARTFIELD TO BREAKFAST, DID NOT ARRIVE AT ALL TOO SOON;
AND HALF AN HOUR STOLEN AFTERWARDS TO GO OVER THE SAME GROUND AGAIN
WITH HIM, LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY, WAS QUITE NECESSARY TO REINSTATE
HER IN A PROPER SHARE OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE EVENING BEFORE.

HE HAD NOT LEFT HER LONG, BY NO MEANS LONG ENOUGH FOR HER TO HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION FOR THINKING OF ANY BODY ELSE, WHEN A LETTER
WAS BROUGHT HER FROM RANDALLS--A VERY THICK LETTER;--SHE GUESSED
WHAT IT MUST CONTAIN, AND DEPRECATED THE NECESSITY OF READING IT.--
SHE WAS NOW IN PERFECT CHARITY WITH FRANK CHURCHILL; SHE WANTED
NO EXPLANATIONS, SHE WANTED ONLY TO HAVE HER THOUGHTS TO HERSELF--
AND AS FOR UNDERSTANDING ANY THING HE WROTE, SHE WAS SURE SHE WAS
INCAPABLE OF IT.--IT MUST BE WADED THROUGH, HOWEVER.  SHE OPENED
THE PACKET; IT WAS TOO SURELY SO;--A NOTE FROM MRS. WESTON TO HERSELF,
USHERED IN THE LETTER FROM FRANK TO MRS. WESTON.

"I HAVE THE GREATEST PLEASURE, MY DEAR EMMA, IN FORWARDING
TO YOU THE ENCLOSED.  I KNOW WHAT THOROUGH JUSTICE YOU WILL
DO IT, AND HAVE SCARCELY A DOUBT OF ITS HAPPY EFFECT.--I THINK
WE SHALL NEVER MATERIALLY DISAGREE ABOUT THE WRITER AGAIN;
BUT I WILL NOT DELAY YOU BY A LONG PREFACE.--WE ARE QUITE WELL.--
THIS LETTER HAS BEEN THE CURE OF ALL THE LITTLE NERVOUSNESS I HAVE
BEEN FEELING LATELY.--I DID NOT QUITE LIKE YOUR LOOKS ON TUESDAY,
BUT IT WAS AN UNGENIAL MORNING; AND THOUGH YOU WILL NEVER OWN BEING
AFFECTED BY WEATHER, I THINK EVERY BODY FEELS A NORTH-EAST WIND.--
I FELT FOR YOUR DEAR FATHER VERY MUCH IN THE STORM OF TUESDAY
AFTERNOON AND YESTERDAY MORNING, BUT HAD THE COMFORT OF HEARING
LAST NIGHT, BY MR. PERRY, THAT IT HAD NOT MADE HIM ILL.
                              "YOURS EVER,
                                                       "A. W."

                       [TO MRS. WESTON.]
                                                       WINDSOR-JULY.
MY DEAR MADAM,

"IF I MADE MYSELF INTELLIGIBLE YESTERDAY, THIS LETTER WILL BE EXPECTED;
BUT EXPECTED OR NOT, I KNOW IT WILL BE READ WITH CANDOUR AND INDULGENCE.--
YOU ARE ALL GOODNESS, AND I BELIEVE THERE WILL BE NEED OF EVEN
ALL YOUR GOODNESS TO ALLOW FOR SOME PARTS OF MY PAST CONDUCT.--
BUT I HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN BY ONE WHO HAD STILL MORE TO RESENT.
MY COURAGE RISES WHILE I WRITE.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE
PROSPEROUS TO BE HUMBLE.  I HAVE ALREADY MET WITH SUCH SUCCESS
IN TWO APPLICATIONS FOR PARDON, THAT I MAY BE IN DANGER OF THINKING
MYSELF TOO SURE OF YOURS, AND OF THOSE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS WHO HAVE
HAD ANY GROUND OF OFFENCE.--YOU MUST ALL ENDEAVOUR TO COMPREHEND
THE EXACT NATURE OF MY SITUATION WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED AT RANDALLS;
YOU MUST CONSIDER ME AS HAVING A SECRET WHICH WAS TO BE KEPT
AT ALL HAZARDS.  THIS WAS THE FACT.  MY RIGHT TO PLACE MYSELF
IN A SITUATION REQUIRING SUCH CONCEALMENT, IS ANOTHER QUESTION.
I SHALL NOT DISCUSS IT HERE.  FOR MY TEMPTATION TO _THINK_ IT A RIGHT,
I REFER EVERY CAVILLER TO A BRICK HOUSE, SASHED WINDOWS BELOW,
AND CASEMENTS ABOVE, IN HIGHBURY.  I DARED NOT ADDRESS HER OPENLY;
MY DIFFICULTIES IN THE THEN STATE OF ENSCOMBE MUST BE TOO WELL
KNOWN TO REQUIRE DEFINITION; AND I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO PREVAIL,
BEFORE WE PARTED AT WEYMOUTH, AND TO INDUCE THE MOST UPRIGHT FEMALE
MIND IN THE CREATION TO STOOP IN CHARITY TO A SECRET ENGAGEMENT.--
HAD SHE REFUSED, I SHOULD HAVE GONE MAD.--BUT YOU WILL BE READY TO SAY,
WHAT WAS YOUR HOPE IN DOING THIS?--WHAT DID YOU LOOK FORWARD TO?--
TO ANY THING, EVERY THING--TO TIME, CHANCE, CIRCUMSTANCE, SLOW EFFECTS,
SUDDEN BURSTS, PERSEVERANCE AND WEARINESS, HEALTH AND SICKNESS.
EVERY POSSIBILITY OF GOOD WAS BEFORE ME, AND THE FIRST OF BLESSINGS
SECURED, IN OBTAINING HER PROMISES OF FAITH AND CORRESPONDENCE.
IF YOU NEED FARTHER EXPLANATION, I HAVE THE HONOUR, MY DEAR MADAM,
OF BEING YOUR HUSBAND'S SON, AND THE ADVANTAGE OF INHERITING
A DISPOSITION TO HOPE FOR GOOD, WHICH NO INHERITANCE OF HOUSES
OR LANDS CAN EVER EQUAL THE VALUE OF.--SEE ME, THEN, UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES, ARRIVING ON MY FIRST VISIT TO RANDALLS;--AND HERE I
AM CONSCIOUS OF WRONG, FOR THAT VISIT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOONER PAID.
YOU WILL LOOK BACK AND SEE THAT I DID NOT COME TILL MISS FAIRFAX
WAS IN HIGHBURY; AND AS _YOU_ WERE THE PERSON SLIGHTED, YOU WILL
FORGIVE ME INSTANTLY; BUT I MUST WORK ON MY FATHER'S COMPASSION,
BY REMINDING HIM, THAT SO LONG AS I ABSENTED MYSELF FROM HIS HOUSE,
SO LONG I LOST THE BLESSING OF KNOWING YOU.  MY BEHAVIOUR,
DURING THE VERY HAPPY FORTNIGHT WHICH I SPENT WITH YOU, DID NOT,
I HOPE, LAY ME OPEN TO REPREHENSION, EXCEPTING ON ONE POINT.
AND NOW I COME TO THE PRINCIPAL, THE ONLY IMPORTANT PART OF MY
CONDUCT WHILE BELONGING TO YOU, WHICH EXCITES MY OWN ANXIETY,
OR REQUIRES VERY SOLICITOUS EXPLANATION.  WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT,
AND THE WARMEST FRIENDSHIP, DO I MENTION MISS WOODHOUSE; MY FATHER
PERHAPS WILL THINK I OUGHT TO ADD, WITH THE DEEPEST HUMILIATION.--
A FEW WORDS WHICH DROPPED FROM HIM YESTERDAY SPOKE HIS OPINION,
AND SOME CENSURE I ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF LIABLE TO.--MY BEHAVIOUR
TO MISS WOODHOUSE INDICATED, I BELIEVE, MORE THAN IT OUGHT.--
IN ORDER TO ASSIST A CONCEALMENT SO ESSENTIAL TO ME, I WAS LED
ON TO MAKE MORE THAN AN ALLOWABLE USE OF THE SORT OF INTIMACY
INTO WHICH WE WERE IMMEDIATELY THROWN.--I CANNOT DENY THAT MISS
WOODHOUSE WAS MY OSTENSIBLE OBJECT--BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL BELIEVE
THE DECLARATION, THAT HAD I NOT BEEN CONVINCED OF HER INDIFFERENCE,
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY ANY SELFISH VIEWS TO GO ON.--
AMIABLE AND DELIGHTFUL AS MISS WOODHOUSE IS, SHE NEVER GAVE ME
THE IDEA OF A YOUNG WOMAN LIKELY TO BE ATTACHED; AND THAT SHE WAS
PERFECTLY FREE FROM ANY TENDENCY TO BEING ATTACHED TO ME, WAS AS MUCH
MY CONVICTION AS MY WISH.--SHE RECEIVED MY ATTENTIONS WITH AN EASY,
FRIENDLY, GOODHUMOURED PLAYFULNESS, WHICH EXACTLY SUITED ME.
WE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.  FROM OUR RELATIVE SITUATION,
THOSE ATTENTIONS WERE HER DUE, AND WERE FELT TO BE SO.--WHETHER MISS
WOODHOUSE BEGAN REALLY TO UNDERSTAND ME BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF
THAT FORTNIGHT, I CANNOT SAY;--WHEN I CALLED TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER,
I REMEMBER THAT I WAS WITHIN A MOMENT OF CONFESSING THE TRUTH,
AND I THEN FANCIED SHE WAS NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION; BUT I HAVE NO
DOUBT OF HER HAVING SINCE DETECTED ME, AT LEAST IN SOME DEGREE.--
SHE MAY NOT HAVE SURMISED THE WHOLE, BUT HER QUICKNESS MUST
HAVE PENETRATED A PART.  I CANNOT DOUBT IT.  YOU WILL FIND,
WHENEVER THE SUBJECT BECOMES FREED FROM ITS PRESENT RESTRAINTS,
THAT IT DID NOT TAKE HER WHOLLY BY SURPRIZE.  SHE FREQUENTLY GAVE
ME HINTS OF IT.  I REMEMBER HER TELLING ME AT THE BALL, THAT I
OWED MRS. ELTON GRATITUDE FOR HER ATTENTIONS TO MISS FAIRFAX.--
I HOPE THIS HISTORY OF MY CONDUCT TOWARDS HER WILL BE ADMITTED
BY YOU AND MY FATHER AS GREAT EXTENUATION OF WHAT YOU SAW AMISS.
WHILE YOU CONSIDERED ME AS HAVING SINNED AGAINST EMMA WOODHOUSE,
I COULD DESERVE NOTHING FROM EITHER.  ACQUIT ME HERE, AND PROCURE
FOR ME, WHEN IT IS ALLOWABLE, THE ACQUITTAL AND GOOD WISHES OF THAT
SAID EMMA WOODHOUSE, WHOM I REGARD WITH SO MUCH BROTHERLY AFFECTION,
AS TO LONG TO HAVE HER AS DEEPLY AND AS HAPPILY IN LOVE AS MYSELF.--
WHATEVER STRANGE THINGS I SAID OR DID DURING THAT FORTNIGHT, YOU HAVE
NOW A KEY TO.  MY HEART WAS IN HIGHBURY, AND MY BUSINESS WAS TO GET
MY BODY THITHER AS OFTEN AS MIGHT BE, AND WITH THE LEAST SUSPICION.
IF YOU REMEMBER ANY QUEERNESSES, SET THEM ALL TO THE RIGHT ACCOUNT.--
OF THE PIANOFORTE SO MUCH TALKED OF, I FEEL IT ONLY NECESSARY TO SAY,
THAT ITS BEING ORDERED WAS ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN TO MISS F--, WHO WOULD
NEVER HAVE ALLOWED ME TO SEND IT, HAD ANY CHOICE BEEN GIVEN HER.--
THE DELICACY OF HER MIND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ENGAGEMENT,
MY DEAR MADAM, IS MUCH BEYOND MY POWER OF DOING JUSTICE TO.
YOU WILL SOON, I EARNESTLY HOPE, KNOW HER THOROUGHLY YOURSELF.--
NO DESCRIPTION CAN DESCRIBE HER.  SHE MUST TELL YOU HERSELF WHAT SHE IS--
YET NOT BY WORD, FOR NEVER WAS THERE A HUMAN CREATURE WHO WOULD
SO DESIGNEDLY SUPPRESS HER OWN MERIT.--SINCE I BEGAN THIS LETTER,
WHICH WILL BE LONGER THAN I FORESAW, I HAVE HEARD FROM HER.--
SHE GIVES A GOOD ACCOUNT OF HER OWN HEALTH; BUT AS SHE NEVER COMPLAINS,
I DARE NOT DEPEND.  I WANT TO HAVE YOUR OPINION OF HER LOOKS.
I KNOW YOU WILL SOON CALL ON HER; SHE IS LIVING IN DREAD OF THE VISIT.
PERHAPS IT IS PAID ALREADY.  LET ME HEAR FROM YOU WITHOUT DELAY;
I AM IMPATIENT FOR A THOUSAND PARTICULARS.  REMEMBER HOW FEW
MINUTES I WAS AT RANDALLS, AND IN HOW BEWILDERED, HOW MAD A STATE:
AND I AM NOT MUCH BETTER YET; STILL INSANE EITHER FROM HAPPINESS
OR MISERY.  WHEN I THINK OF THE KINDNESS AND FAVOUR I HAVE MET WITH,
OF HER EXCELLENCE AND PATIENCE, AND MY UNCLE'S GENEROSITY, I AM MAD
WITH JOY:  BUT WHEN I RECOLLECT ALL THE UNEASINESS I OCCASIONED HER,
AND HOW LITTLE I DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN, I AM MAD WITH ANGER.
IF I COULD BUT SEE HER AGAIN!--BUT I MUST NOT PROPOSE IT YET.
MY UNCLE HAS BEEN TOO GOOD FOR ME TO ENCROACH.--I MUST STILL ADD
TO THIS LONG LETTER.  YOU HAVE NOT HEARD ALL THAT YOU OUGHT TO HEAR.
I COULD NOT GIVE ANY CONNECTED DETAIL YESTERDAY; BUT THE SUDDENNESS,
AND, IN ONE LIGHT, THE UNSEASONABLENESS WITH WHICH THE AFFAIR BURST OUT,
NEEDS EXPLANATION; FOR THOUGH THE EVENT OF THE 26TH ULT., AS YOU
WILL CONCLUDE, IMMEDIATELY OPENED TO ME THE HAPPIEST PROSPECTS,
I SHOULD NOT HAVE PRESUMED ON SUCH EARLY MEASURES, BUT FROM THE
VERY PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH LEFT ME NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE.
I SHOULD MYSELF HAVE SHRUNK FROM ANY THING SO HASTY, AND SHE WOULD HAVE
FELT EVERY SCRUPLE OF MINE WITH MULTIPLIED STRENGTH AND REFINEMENT.--
BUT I HAD NO CHOICE.  THE HASTY ENGAGEMENT SHE HAD ENTERED INTO WITH
THAT WOMAN--HERE, MY DEAR MADAM, I WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE OFF ABRUPTLY,
TO RECOLLECT AND COMPOSE MYSELF.--I HAVE BEEN WALKING OVER THE COUNTRY,
AND AM NOW, I HOPE, RATIONAL ENOUGH TO MAKE THE REST OF MY LETTER
WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE.--IT IS, IN FACT, A MOST MORTIFYING RETROSPECT
FOR ME.  I BEHAVED SHAMEFULLY.  AND HERE I CAN ADMIT, THAT MY MANNERS
TO MISS W., IN BEING UNPLEASANT TO MISS F., WERE HIGHLY BLAMEABLE.
_SHE_ DISAPPROVED THEM, WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN ENOUGH.--MY PLEA OF
CONCEALING THE TRUTH SHE DID NOT THINK SUFFICIENT.--SHE WAS DISPLEASED;
I THOUGHT UNREASONABLY SO:  I THOUGHT HER, ON A THOUSAND OCCASIONS,
UNNECESSARILY SCRUPULOUS AND CAUTIOUS:  I THOUGHT HER EVEN COLD.
BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS RIGHT.  IF I HAD FOLLOWED HER JUDGMENT, AND SUBDUED
MY SPIRITS TO THE LEVEL OF WHAT SHE DEEMED PROPER, I SHOULD HAVE
ESCAPED THE GREATEST UNHAPPINESS I HAVE EVER KNOWN.--WE QUARRELLED.--
DO YOU REMEMBER THE MORNING SPENT AT DONWELL?--_THERE_ EVERY LITTLE
DISSATISFACTION THAT HAD OCCURRED BEFORE CAME TO A CRISIS.  I WAS LATE;
I MET HER WALKING HOME BY HERSELF, AND WANTED TO WALK WITH HER,
BUT SHE WOULD NOT SUFFER IT.  SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO ALLOW ME,
WHICH I THEN THOUGHT MOST UNREASONABLE.  NOW, HOWEVER, I SEE NOTHING
IN IT BUT A VERY NATURAL AND CONSISTENT DEGREE OF DISCRETION.
WHILE I, TO BLIND THE WORLD TO OUR ENGAGEMENT, WAS BEHAVING ONE
HOUR WITH OBJECTIONABLE PARTICULARITY TO ANOTHER WOMAN, WAS SHE
TO BE CONSENTING THE NEXT TO A PROPOSAL WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE
EVERY PREVIOUS CAUTION USELESS?--HAD WE BEEN MET WALKING TOGETHER
BETWEEN DONWELL AND HIGHBURY, THE TRUTH MUST HAVE BEEN SUSPECTED.--
I WAS MAD ENOUGH, HOWEVER, TO RESENT.--I DOUBTED HER AFFECTION.
I DOUBTED IT MORE THE NEXT DAY ON BOX HILL; WHEN, PROVOKED BY
SUCH CONDUCT ON MY SIDE, SUCH SHAMEFUL, INSOLENT NEGLECT OF HER,
AND SUCH APPARENT DEVOTION TO MISS W., AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY WOMAN OF SENSE TO ENDURE, SHE SPOKE HER
RESENTMENT IN A FORM OF WORDS PERFECTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO ME.--
IN SHORT, MY DEAR MADAM, IT WAS A QUARREL BLAMELESS ON HER SIDE,
ABOMINABLE ON MINE; AND I RETURNED THE SAME EVENING TO RICHMOND,
THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE STAID WITH YOU TILL THE NEXT MORNING,
MERELY BECAUSE I WOULD BE AS ANGRY WITH HER AS POSSIBLE.  EVEN THEN,
I WAS NOT SUCH A FOOL AS NOT TO MEAN TO BE RECONCILED IN TIME;
BUT I WAS THE INJURED PERSON, INJURED BY HER COLDNESS, AND I WENT
AWAY DETERMINED THAT SHE SHOULD MAKE THE FIRST ADVANCES.--I SHALL
ALWAYS CONGRATULATE MYSELF THAT YOU WERE NOT OF THE BOX HILL PARTY.
HAD YOU WITNESSED MY BEHAVIOUR THERE, I CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE YOU WOULD
EVER HAVE THOUGHT WELL OF ME AGAIN.  ITS EFFECT UPON HER APPEARS
IN THE IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION IT PRODUCED:  AS SOON AS SHE FOUND I
WAS REALLY GONE FROM RANDALLS, SHE CLOSED WITH THE OFFER OF THAT
OFFICIOUS MRS. ELTON; THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF WHOSE TREATMENT OF HER,
BY THE BYE, HAS EVER FILLED ME WITH INDIGNATION AND HATRED.
I MUST NOT QUARREL WITH A SPIRIT OF FORBEARANCE WHICH HAS BEEN
SO RICHLY EXTENDED TOWARDS MYSELF; BUT, OTHERWISE, I SHOULD LOUDLY
PROTEST AGAINST THE SHARE OF IT WHICH THAT WOMAN HAS KNOWN.--
`JANE,' INDEED!--YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT I HAVE NOT YET INDULGED MYSELF
IN CALLING HER BY THAT NAME, EVEN TO YOU.  THINK, THEN, WHAT I MUST
HAVE ENDURED IN HEARING IT BANDIED BETWEEN THE ELTONS WITH ALL
THE VULGARITY OF NEEDLESS REPETITION, AND ALL THE INSOLENCE OF
IMAGINARY SUPERIORITY.  HAVE PATIENCE WITH ME, I SHALL SOON HAVE DONE.--
SHE CLOSED WITH THIS OFFER, RESOLVING TO BREAK WITH ME ENTIRELY,
AND WROTE THE NEXT DAY TO TELL ME THAT WE NEVER WERE TO MEET AGAIN.--
_SHE_ _FELT_ _THE_ _ENGAGEMENT_ _TO_ _BE_ _A_ _SOURCE_ _OF_ _REPENTANCE_ _AND_ _MISERY_
_TO_ _EACH_:  _SHE_ _DISSOLVED_ _IT_.--THIS LETTER REACHED ME ON THE VERY
MORNING OF MY POOR AUNT'S DEATH.  I ANSWERED IT WITHIN AN HOUR;
BUT FROM THE CONFUSION OF MY MIND, AND THE MULTIPLICITY OF BUSINESS
FALLING ON ME AT ONCE, MY ANSWER, INSTEAD OF BEING SENT WITH ALL
THE MANY OTHER LETTERS OF THAT DAY, WAS LOCKED UP IN MY WRITING-DESK;
AND I, TRUSTING THAT I HAD WRITTEN ENOUGH, THOUGH BUT A FEW LINES,
TO SATISFY HER, REMAINED WITHOUT ANY UNEASINESS.--I WAS RATHER
DISAPPOINTED THAT I DID NOT HEAR FROM HER AGAIN SPEEDILY;
BUT I MADE EXCUSES FOR HER, AND WAS TOO BUSY, AND--MAY I ADD?--
TOO CHEERFUL IN MY VIEWS TO BE CAPTIOUS.--WE REMOVED TO WINDSOR;
AND TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS I RECEIVED A PARCEL FROM HER, MY OWN LETTERS
ALL RETURNED!--AND A FEW LINES AT THE SAME TIME BY THE POST,
STATING HER EXTREME SURPRIZE AT NOT HAVING HAD THE SMALLEST REPLY
TO HER LAST; AND ADDING, THAT AS SILENCE ON SUCH A POINT COULD
NOT BE MISCONSTRUED, AND AS IT MUST BE EQUALLY DESIRABLE TO BOTH
TO HAVE EVERY SUBORDINATE ARRANGEMENT CONCLUDED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
SHE NOW SENT ME, BY A SAFE CONVEYANCE, ALL MY LETTERS, AND REQUESTED,
THAT IF I COULD NOT DIRECTLY COMMAND HERS, SO AS TO SEND THEM
TO HIGHBURY WITHIN A WEEK, I WOULD FORWARD THEM AFTER THAT PERIOD
TO HER AT--:  IN SHORT, THE FULL DIRECTION TO MR. SMALLRIDGE'S,
NEAR BRISTOL, STARED ME IN THE FACE.  I KNEW THE NAME, THE PLACE,
I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT, AND INSTANTLY SAW WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING.
IT WAS PERFECTLY ACCORDANT WITH THAT RESOLUTION OF CHARACTER
WHICH I KNEW HER TO POSSESS; AND THE SECRECY SHE HAD MAINTAINED,
AS TO ANY SUCH DESIGN IN HER FORMER LETTER, WAS EQUALLY DESCRIPTIVE
OF ITS ANXIOUS DELICACY.  FOR THE WORLD WOULD NOT SHE HAVE SEEMED
TO THREATEN ME.--IMAGINE THE SHOCK; IMAGINE HOW, TILL I HAD ACTUALLY
DETECTED MY OWN BLUNDER, I RAVED AT THE BLUNDERS OF THE POST.--
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE?--ONE THING ONLY.--I MUST SPEAK TO MY UNCLE.
WITHOUT HIS SANCTION I COULD NOT HOPE TO BE LISTENED TO AGAIN.--
I SPOKE; CIRCUMSTANCES WERE IN MY FAVOUR; THE LATE EVENT HAD SOFTENED
AWAY HIS PRIDE, AND HE WAS, EARLIER THAN I COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED,
WHOLLY RECONCILED AND COMPLYING; AND COULD SAY AT LAST, POOR MAN!
WITH A DEEP SIGH, THAT HE WISHED I MIGHT FIND AS MUCH HAPPINESS
IN THE MARRIAGE STATE AS HE HAD DONE.--I FELT THAT IT WOULD BE
OF A DIFFERENT SORT.--ARE YOU DISPOSED TO PITY ME FOR WHAT I MUST
HAVE SUFFERED IN OPENING THE CAUSE TO HIM, FOR MY SUSPENSE WHILE
ALL WAS AT STAKE?--NO; DO NOT PITY ME TILL I REACHED HIGHBURY,
AND SAW HOW ILL I HAD MADE HER.  DO NOT PITY ME TILL I SAW HER WAN,
SICK LOOKS.--I REACHED HIGHBURY AT THE TIME OF DAY WHEN, FROM MY
KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR LATE BREAKFAST HOUR, I WAS CERTAIN OF A GOOD CHANCE
OF FINDING HER ALONE.--I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED; AND AT LAST I WAS
NOT DISAPPOINTED EITHER IN THE OBJECT OF MY JOURNEY.  A GREAT DEAL
OF VERY REASONABLE, VERY JUST DISPLEASURE I HAD TO PERSUADE AWAY.
BUT IT IS DONE; WE ARE RECONCILED, DEARER, MUCH DEARER, THAN EVER,
AND NO MOMENT'S UNEASINESS CAN EVER OCCUR BETWEEN US AGAIN.  NOW, MY
DEAR MADAM, I WILL RELEASE YOU; BUT I COULD NOT CONCLUDE BEFORE.
A THOUSAND AND A THOUSAND THANKS FOR ALL THE KINDNESS YOU HAVE
EVER SHEWN ME, AND TEN THOUSAND FOR THE ATTENTIONS YOUR HEART
WILL DICTATE TOWARDS HER.--IF YOU THINK ME IN A WAY TO BE HAPPIER
THAN I DESERVE, I AM QUITE OF YOUR OPINION.--MISS W. CALLS ME
THE CHILD OF GOOD FORTUNE.  I HOPE SHE IS RIGHT.--IN ONE RESPECT,
MY GOOD FORTUNE IS UNDOUBTED, THAT OF BEING ABLE TO SUBSCRIBE
MYSELF,
                    YOUR OBLIGED AND AFFECTIONATE SON,
                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.



CHAPTER XV


THIS LETTER MUST MAKE ITS WAY TO EMMA'S FEELINGS.  SHE WAS OBLIGED,
IN SPITE OF HER PREVIOUS DETERMINATION TO THE CONTRARY, TO DO
IT ALL THE JUSTICE THAT MRS. WESTON FORETOLD.  AS SOON AS SHE
CAME TO HER OWN NAME, IT WAS IRRESISTIBLE; EVERY LINE RELATING
TO HERSELF WAS INTERESTING, AND ALMOST EVERY LINE AGREEABLE;
AND WHEN THIS CHARM CEASED, THE SUBJECT COULD STILL MAINTAIN ITSELF,
BY THE NATURAL RETURN OF HER FORMER REGARD FOR THE WRITER, AND THE
VERY STRONG ATTRACTION WHICH ANY PICTURE OF LOVE MUST HAVE FOR HER AT
THAT MOMENT.  SHE NEVER STOPT TILL SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THE WHOLE;
AND THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO FEEL THAT HE HAD BEEN WRONG,
YET HE HAD BEEN LESS WRONG THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED--AND HE HAD SUFFERED,
AND WAS VERY SORRY--AND HE WAS SO GRATEFUL TO MRS. WESTON,
AND SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH MISS FAIRFAX, AND SHE WAS SO HAPPY HERSELF,
THAT THERE WAS NO BEING SEVERE; AND COULD HE HAVE ENTERED THE ROOM,
SHE MUST HAVE SHAKEN HANDS WITH HIM AS HEARTILY AS EVER.

SHE THOUGHT SO WELL OF THE LETTER, THAT WHEN MR. KNIGHTLEY CAME AGAIN,
SHE DESIRED HIM TO READ IT.  SHE WAS SURE OF MRS. WESTON'S WISHING
IT TO BE COMMUNICATED; ESPECIALLY TO ONE, WHO, LIKE MR. KNIGHTLEY,
HAD SEEN SO MUCH TO BLAME IN HIS CONDUCT.

"I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO LOOK IT OVER," SAID HE; "BUT IT SEEMS LONG.
I WILL TAKE IT HOME WITH ME AT NIGHT."

BUT THAT WOULD NOT DO.  MR. WESTON WAS TO CALL IN THE EVENING,
AND SHE MUST RETURN IT BY HIM.

"I WOULD RATHER BE TALKING TO YOU," HE REPLIED; "BUT AS IT SEEMS
A MATTER OF JUSTICE, IT SHALL BE DONE."

HE BEGAN--STOPPING, HOWEVER, ALMOST DIRECTLY TO SAY, "HAD I BEEN OFFERED
THE SIGHT OF ONE OF THIS GENTLEMAN'S LETTERS TO HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW A FEW
MONTHS AGO, EMMA, IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TAKEN WITH SUCH INDIFFERENCE."

HE PROCEEDED A LITTLE FARTHER, READING TO HIMSELF; AND THEN,
WITH A SMILE, OBSERVED, "HUMPH! A FINE COMPLIMENTARY OPENING:
BUT IT IS HIS WAY.  ONE MAN'S STYLE MUST NOT BE THE RULE OF ANOTHER'S.
WE WILL NOT BE SEVERE."

"IT WILL BE NATURAL FOR ME," HE ADDED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, "TO SPEAK MY
OPINION ALOUD AS I READ.  BY DOING IT, I SHALL FEEL THAT I AM NEAR YOU.
IT WILL NOT BE SO GREAT A LOSS OF TIME:  BUT IF YOU DISLIKE IT--"

"NOT AT ALL.  I SHOULD WISH IT."

MR. KNIGHTLEY RETURNED TO HIS READING WITH GREATER ALACRITY.

"HE TRIFLES HERE," SAID HE, "AS TO THE TEMPTATION.  HE KNOWS
HE IS WRONG, AND HAS NOTHING RATIONAL TO URGE.--BAD.--HE OUGHT
NOT TO HAVE FORMED THE ENGAGEMENT.--`HIS FATHER'S DISPOSITION:'--
HE IS UNJUST, HOWEVER, TO HIS FATHER.  MR. WESTON'S SANGUINE
TEMPER WAS A BLESSING ON ALL HIS UPRIGHT AND HONOURABLE EXERTIONS;
BUT MR. WESTON EARNED EVERY PRESENT COMFORT BEFORE HE ENDEAVOURED
TO GAIN IT.--VERY TRUE; HE DID NOT COME TILL MISS FAIRFAX WAS HERE."

"AND I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN," SAID EMMA, "HOW SURE YOU WERE THAT HE
MIGHT HAVE COME SOONER IF HE WOULD.  YOU PASS IT OVER VERY HANDSOMELY--
BUT YOU WERE PERFECTLY RIGHT."

"I WAS NOT QUITE IMPARTIAL IN MY JUDGMENT, EMMA:--BUT YET, I THINK--
HAD _YOU_ NOT BEEN IN THE CASE--I SHOULD STILL HAVE DISTRUSTED HIM."

WHEN HE CAME TO MISS WOODHOUSE, HE WAS OBLIGED TO READ THE WHOLE
OF IT ALOUD--ALL THAT RELATED TO HER, WITH A SMILE; A LOOK;
A SHAKE OF THE HEAD; A WORD OR TWO OF ASSENT, OR DISAPPROBATION;
OR MERELY OF LOVE, AS THE SUBJECT REQUIRED; CONCLUDING, HOWEVER,
SERIOUSLY, AND, AFTER STEADY REFLECTION, THUS--

"VERY BAD--THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE.--PLAYING A MOST
DANGEROUS GAME.  TOO MUCH INDEBTED TO THE EVENT FOR HIS ACQUITTAL.--
NO JUDGE OF HIS OWN MANNERS BY YOU.--ALWAYS DECEIVED IN FACT BY HIS
OWN WISHES, AND REGARDLESS OF LITTLE BESIDES HIS OWN CONVENIENCE.--
FANCYING YOU TO HAVE FATHOMED HIS SECRET.  NATURAL ENOUGH!--
HIS OWN MIND FULL OF INTRIGUE, THAT HE SHOULD SUSPECT IT
IN OTHERS.--MYSTERY; FINESSE--HOW THEY PERVERT THE UNDERSTANDING!
MY EMMA, DOES NOT EVERY THING SERVE TO PROVE MORE AND MORE THE
BEAUTY OF TRUTH AND SINCERITY IN ALL OUR DEALINGS WITH EACH OTHER?"

EMMA AGREED TO IT, AND WITH A BLUSH OF SENSIBILITY ON HARRIET'S ACCOUNT,
WHICH SHE COULD NOT GIVE ANY SINCERE EXPLANATION OF.

"YOU HAD BETTER GO ON," SAID SHE.

HE DID SO, BUT VERY SOON STOPT AGAIN TO SAY, "THE PIANOFORTE!
AH!  THAT WAS THE ACT OF A VERY, VERY YOUNG MAN, ONE TOO YOUNG
TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE INCONVENIENCE OF IT MIGHT NOT VERY MUCH
EXCEED THE PLEASURE.  A BOYISH SCHEME, INDEED!--I CANNOT
COMPREHEND A MAN'S WISHING TO GIVE A WOMAN ANY PROOF OF AFFECTION
WHICH HE KNOWS SHE WOULD RATHER DISPENSE WITH; AND HE DID
KNOW THAT SHE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE INSTRUMENT'S COMING IF SHE COULD."

AFTER THIS, HE MADE SOME PROGRESS WITHOUT ANY PAUSE.
FRANK CHURCHILL'S CONFESSION OF HAVING BEHAVED SHAMEFULLY
WAS THE FIRST THING TO CALL FOR MORE THAN A WORD IN PASSING.

"I PERFECTLY AGREE WITH YOU, SIR,"--WAS THEN HIS REMARK.
"YOU DID BEHAVE VERY SHAMEFULLY.  YOU NEVER WROTE A TRUER LINE."
AND HAVING GONE THROUGH WHAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED OF THE BASIS
OF THEIR DISAGREEMENT, AND HIS PERSISTING TO ACT IN DIRECT
OPPOSITION TO JANE FAIRFAX'S SENSE OF RIGHT, HE MADE A FULLER PAUSE
TO SAY, "THIS IS VERY BAD.--HE HAD INDUCED HER TO PLACE HERSELF,
FOR HIS SAKE, IN A SITUATION OF EXTREME DIFFICULTY AND UNEASINESS,
AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS FIRST OBJECT TO PREVENT HER FROM
SUFFERING UNNECESSARILY.--SHE MUST HAVE HAD MUCH MORE TO CONTEND WITH,
IN CARRYING ON THE CORRESPONDENCE, THAN HE COULD.  HE SHOULD HAVE
RESPECTED EVEN UNREASONABLE SCRUPLES, HAD THERE BEEN SUCH; BUT HERS
WERE ALL REASONABLE.  WE MUST LOOK TO HER ONE FAULT, AND REMEMBER
THAT SHE HAD DONE A WRONG THING IN CONSENTING TO THE ENGAGEMENT,
TO BEAR THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN SUCH A STATE OF PUNISHMENT."

EMMA KNEW THAT HE WAS NOW GETTING TO THE BOX HILL PARTY,
AND GREW UNCOMFORTABLE.  HER OWN BEHAVIOUR HAD BEEN SO VERY IMPROPER!
SHE WAS DEEPLY ASHAMED, AND A LITTLE AFRAID OF HIS NEXT LOOK.
IT WAS ALL READ, HOWEVER, STEADILY, ATTENTIVELY, AND WITHOUT
THE SMALLEST REMARK; AND, EXCEPTING ONE MOMENTARY GLANCE AT HER,
INSTANTLY WITHDRAWN, IN THE FEAR OF GIVING PAIN--NO REMEMBRANCE
OF BOX HILL SEEMED TO EXIST.

"THERE IS NO SAYING MUCH FOR THE DELICACY OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS,
THE ELTONS," WAS HIS NEXT OBSERVATION.--"HIS FEELINGS ARE NATURAL.--
WHAT! ACTUALLY RESOLVE TO BREAK WITH HIM ENTIRELY!--SHE FELT
THE ENGAGEMENT TO BE A SOURCE OF REPENTANCE AND MISERY TO EACH--
SHE DISSOLVED IT.--WHAT A VIEW THIS GIVES OF HER SENSE OF
HIS BEHAVIOUR!--WELL, HE MUST BE A MOST EXTRAORDINARY--"

"NAY, NAY, READ ON.--YOU WILL FIND HOW VERY MUCH HE SUFFERS."

"I HOPE HE DOES," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY COOLLY, AND RESUMING THE LETTER.
"`SMALLRIDGE!'--WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?  WHAT IS ALL THIS?"

"SHE HAD ENGAGED TO GO AS GOVERNESS TO MRS. SMALLRIDGE'S CHILDREN--
A DEAR FRIEND OF MRS. ELTON'S--A NEIGHBOUR OF MAPLE GROVE; AND,
BY THE BYE, I WONDER HOW MRS. ELTON BEARS THE DISAPPOINTMENT?"

"SAY NOTHING, MY DEAR EMMA, WHILE YOU OBLIGE ME TO READ--NOT EVEN
OF MRS. ELTON.  ONLY ONE PAGE MORE.  I SHALL SOON HAVE DONE.
WHAT A LETTER THE MAN WRITES!"

"I WISH YOU WOULD READ IT WITH A KINDER SPIRIT TOWARDS HIM."

"WELL, THERE _IS_ FEELING HERE.--HE DOES SEEM TO HAVE SUFFERED IN FINDING
HER ILL.--CERTAINLY, I CAN HAVE NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING FOND OF HER.
`DEARER, MUCH DEARER THAN EVER.'  I HOPE HE MAY LONG CONTINUE TO FEEL
ALL THE VALUE OF SUCH A RECONCILIATION.--HE IS A VERY LIBERAL THANKER,
WITH HIS THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS.--`HAPPIER THAN I DESERVE.'
COME, HE KNOWS HIMSELF THERE.  `MISS WOODHOUSE CALLS ME THE CHILD
OF GOOD FORTUNE.'--THOSE WERE MISS WOODHOUSE'S WORDS, WERE THEY?--
AND A FINE ENDING--AND THERE IS THE LETTER.  THE CHILD OF GOOD FORTUNE!
THAT WAS YOUR NAME FOR HIM, WAS IT?"

"YOU DO NOT APPEAR SO WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS LETTER AS I AM;
BUT STILL YOU MUST, AT LEAST I HOPE YOU MUST, THINK THE BETTER
OF HIM FOR IT.  I HOPE IT DOES HIM SOME SERVICE WITH YOU."

"YES, CERTAINLY IT DOES.  HE HAS HAD GREAT FAULTS, FAULTS OF
INCONSIDERATION AND THOUGHTLESSNESS; AND I AM VERY MUCH OF HIS
OPINION IN THINKING HIM LIKELY TO BE HAPPIER THAN HE DESERVES:
BUT STILL AS HE IS, BEYOND A DOUBT, REALLY ATTACHED TO MISS FAIRFAX,
AND WILL SOON, IT MAY BE HOPED, HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING CONSTANTLY
WITH HER, I AM VERY READY TO BELIEVE HIS CHARACTER WILL IMPROVE,
AND ACQUIRE FROM HERS THE STEADINESS AND DELICACY OF PRINCIPLE
THAT IT WANTS.  AND NOW, LET ME TALK TO YOU OF SOMETHING ELSE.
I HAVE ANOTHER PERSON'S INTEREST AT PRESENT SO MUCH AT HEART,
THAT I CANNOT THINK ANY LONGER ABOUT FRANK CHURCHILL.  EVER SINCE I
LEFT YOU THIS MORNING, EMMA, MY MIND HAS BEEN HARD AT WORK ON
ONE SUBJECT."

THE SUBJECT FOLLOWED; IT WAS IN PLAIN, UNAFFECTED, GENTLEMANLIKE ENGLISH,
SUCH AS MR. KNIGHTLEY USED EVEN TO THE WOMAN HE WAS IN LOVE WITH,
HOW TO BE ABLE TO ASK HER TO MARRY HIM, WITHOUT ATTACKING THE
HAPPINESS OF HER FATHER.  EMMA'S ANSWER WAS READY AT THE FIRST WORD.
"WHILE HER DEAR FATHER LIVED, ANY CHANGE OF CONDITION MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HER.  SHE COULD NEVER QUIT HIM."  PART ONLY OF THIS ANSWER,
HOWEVER, WAS ADMITTED.  THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER QUITTING HER FATHER,
MR. KNIGHTLEY FELT AS STRONGLY AS HERSELF; BUT THE INADMISSIBILITY
OF ANY OTHER CHANGE, HE COULD NOT AGREE TO.  HE HAD BEEN THINKING
IT OVER MOST DEEPLY, MOST INTENTLY; HE HAD AT FIRST HOPED TO INDUCE
MR. WOODHOUSE TO REMOVE WITH HER TO DONWELL; HE HAD WANTED TO BELIEVE
IT FEASIBLE, BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MR. WOODHOUSE WOULD NOT SUFFER
HIM TO DECEIVE HIMSELF LONG; AND NOW HE CONFESSED HIS PERSUASION,
THAT SUCH A TRANSPLANTATION WOULD BE A RISK OF HER FATHER'S COMFORT,
PERHAPS EVEN OF HIS LIFE, WHICH MUST NOT BE HAZARDED.  MR. WOODHOUSE
TAKEN FROM HARTFIELD!--NO, HE FELT THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE ATTEMPTED.
BUT THE PLAN WHICH HAD ARISEN ON THE SACRIFICE OF THIS, HE TRUSTED
HIS DEAREST EMMA WOULD NOT FIND IN ANY RESPECT OBJECTIONABLE;
IT WAS, THAT HE SHOULD BE RECEIVED AT HARTFIELD; THAT SO LONG AS
HER FATHER'S HAPPINESS IN OTHER WORDS HIS LIFE--REQUIRED HARTFIELD
TO CONTINUE HER HOME, IT SHOULD BE HIS LIKEWISE.

OF THEIR ALL REMOVING TO DONWELL, EMMA HAD ALREADY HAD HER OWN
PASSING THOUGHTS.  LIKE HIM, SHE HAD TRIED THE SCHEME AND REJECTED IT;
BUT SUCH AN ALTERNATIVE AS THIS HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HER.
SHE WAS SENSIBLE OF ALL THE AFFECTION IT EVINCED.  SHE FELT THAT,
IN QUITTING DONWELL, HE MUST BE SACRIFICING A GREAT DEAL OF INDEPENDENCE
OF HOURS AND HABITS; THAT IN LIVING CONSTANTLY WITH HER FATHER,
AND IN NO HOUSE OF HIS OWN, THERE WOULD BE MUCH, VERY MUCH,
TO BE BORNE WITH.  SHE PROMISED TO THINK OF IT, AND ADVISED HIM
TO THINK OF IT MORE; BUT HE WAS FULLY CONVINCED, THAT NO REFLECTION
COULD ALTER HIS WISHES OR HIS OPINION ON THE SUBJECT.  HE HAD
GIVEN IT, HE COULD ASSURE HER, VERY LONG AND CALM CONSIDERATION;
HE HAD BEEN WALKING AWAY FROM WILLIAM LARKINS THE WHOLE MORNING,
TO HAVE HIS THOUGHTS TO HIMSELF.

"AH! THERE IS ONE DIFFICULTY UNPROVIDED FOR," CRIED EMMA.  "I AM
SURE WILLIAM LARKINS WILL NOT LIKE IT.  YOU MUST GET HIS CONSENT
BEFORE YOU ASK MINE."

SHE PROMISED, HOWEVER, TO THINK OF IT; AND PRETTY NEARLY PROMISED, MOREOVER,
TO THINK OF IT, WITH THE INTENTION OF FINDING IT A VERY GOOD SCHEME.

IT IS REMARKABLE, THAT EMMA, IN THE MANY, VERY MANY, POINTS OF VIEW
IN WHICH SHE WAS NOW BEGINNING TO CONSIDER DONWELL ABBEY, WAS NEVER
STRUCK WITH ANY SENSE OF INJURY TO HER NEPHEW HENRY, WHOSE RIGHTS
AS HEIR-EXPECTANT HAD FORMERLY BEEN SO TENACIOUSLY REGARDED.
THINK SHE MUST OF THE POSSIBLE DIFFERENCE TO THE POOR LITTLE BOY;
AND YET SHE ONLY GAVE HERSELF A SAUCY CONSCIOUS SMILE ABOUT IT,
AND FOUND AMUSEMENT IN DETECTING THE REAL CAUSE OF THAT VIOLENT
DISLIKE OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S MARRYING JANE FAIRFAX, OR ANY BODY ELSE,
WHICH AT THE TIME SHE HAD WHOLLY IMPUTED TO THE AMIABLE SOLICITUDE OF
THE SISTER AND THE AUNT.

THIS PROPOSAL OF HIS, THIS PLAN OF MARRYING AND CONTINUING AT HARTFIELD--
THE MORE SHE CONTEMPLATED IT, THE MORE PLEASING IT BECAME.
HIS EVILS SEEMED TO LESSEN, HER OWN ADVANTAGES TO INCREASE,
THEIR MUTUAL GOOD TO OUTWEIGH EVERY DRAWBACK.  SUCH A COMPANION
FOR HERSELF IN THE PERIODS OF ANXIETY AND CHEERLESSNESS BEFORE HER!--
SUCH A PARTNER IN ALL THOSE DUTIES AND CARES TO WHICH TIME MUST BE
GIVING INCREASE OF MELANCHOLY!

SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO HAPPY BUT FOR POOR HARRIET; BUT EVERY
BLESSING OF HER OWN SEEMED TO INVOLVE AND ADVANCE THE SUFFERINGS
OF HER FRIEND, WHO MUST NOW BE EVEN EXCLUDED FROM HARTFIELD.
THE DELIGHTFUL FAMILY PARTY WHICH EMMA WAS SECURING FOR HERSELF,
POOR HARRIET MUST, IN MERE CHARITABLE CAUTION, BE KEPT AT A
DISTANCE FROM.  SHE WOULD BE A LOSER IN EVERY WAY.  EMMA COULD NOT
DEPLORE HER FUTURE ABSENCE AS ANY DEDUCTION FROM HER OWN ENJOYMENT.
IN SUCH A PARTY, HARRIET WOULD BE RATHER A DEAD WEIGHT THAN OTHERWISE;
BUT FOR THE POOR GIRL HERSELF, IT SEEMED A PECULIARLY CRUEL NECESSITY
THAT WAS TO BE PLACING HER IN SUCH A STATE OF UNMERITED PUNISHMENT.

IN TIME, OF COURSE, MR. KNIGHTLEY WOULD BE FORGOTTEN, THAT IS,
SUPPLANTED; BUT THIS COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO HAPPEN VERY EARLY.
MR. KNIGHTLEY HIMSELF WOULD BE DOING NOTHING TO ASSIST THE CURE;--
NOT LIKE MR. ELTON.  MR. KNIGHTLEY, ALWAYS SO KIND, SO FEELING,
SO TRULY CONSIDERATE FOR EVERY BODY, WOULD NEVER DESERVE TO BE
LESS WORSHIPPED THAN NOW; AND IT REALLY WAS TOO MUCH TO HOPE EVEN
OF HARRIET, THAT SHE COULD BE IN LOVE WITH MORE THAN _THREE_ MEN
IN ONE YEAR.



CHAPTER XVI


IT WAS A VERY GREAT RELIEF TO EMMA TO FIND HARRIET AS DESIROUS
AS HERSELF TO AVOID A MEETING.  THEIR INTERCOURSE WAS PAINFUL
ENOUGH BY LETTER.  HOW MUCH WORSE, HAD THEY BEEN OBLIGED TO MEET!

HARRIET EXPRESSED HERSELF VERY MUCH AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED,
WITHOUT REPROACHES, OR APPARENT SENSE OF ILL-USAGE; AND YET EMMA FANCIED
THERE WAS A SOMETHING OF RESENTMENT, A SOMETHING BORDERING ON IT IN
HER STYLE, WHICH INCREASED THE DESIRABLENESS OF THEIR BEING SEPARATE.--
IT MIGHT BE ONLY HER OWN CONSCIOUSNESS; BUT IT SEEMED AS IF AN
ANGEL ONLY COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE WITHOUT RESENTMENT UNDER SUCH A STROKE.

SHE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING ISABELLA'S INVITATION;
AND SHE WAS FORTUNATE IN HAVING A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR ASKING IT,
WITHOUT RESORTING TO INVENTION.--THERE WAS A TOOTH AMISS.
HARRIET REALLY WISHED, AND HAD WISHED SOME TIME, TO CONSULT A DENTIST.
MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WAS DELIGHTED TO BE OF USE; ANY THING OF ILL
HEALTH WAS A RECOMMENDATION TO HER--AND THOUGH NOT SO FOND OF A
DENTIST AS OF A MR. WINGFIELD, SHE WAS QUITE EAGER TO HAVE HARRIET
UNDER HER CARE.--WHEN IT WAS THUS SETTLED ON HER SISTER'S SIDE,
EMMA PROPOSED IT TO HER FRIEND, AND FOUND HER VERY PERSUADABLE.--
HARRIET WAS TO GO; SHE WAS INVITED FOR AT LEAST A FORTNIGHT; SHE WAS
TO BE CONVEYED IN MR. WOODHOUSE'S CARRIAGE.--IT WAS ALL ARRANGED,
IT WAS ALL COMPLETED, AND HARRIET WAS SAFE IN BRUNSWICK SQUARE.

NOW EMMA COULD, INDEED, ENJOY MR. KNIGHTLEY'S VISITS; NOW SHE
COULD TALK, AND SHE COULD LISTEN WITH TRUE HAPPINESS, UNCHECKED BY
THAT SENSE OF INJUSTICE, OF GUILT, OF SOMETHING MOST PAINFUL,
WHICH HAD HAUNTED HER WHEN REMEMBERING HOW DISAPPOINTED A HEART WAS
NEAR HER, HOW MUCH MIGHT AT THAT MOMENT, AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE,
BE ENDURING BY THE FEELINGS WHICH SHE HAD LED ASTRAY HERSELF.

THE DIFFERENCE OF HARRIET AT MRS. GODDARD'S, OR IN LONDON, MADE PERHAPS
AN UNREASONABLE DIFFERENCE IN EMMA'S SENSATIONS; BUT SHE COULD NOT
THINK OF HER IN LONDON WITHOUT OBJECTS OF CURIOSITY AND EMPLOYMENT,
WHICH MUST BE AVERTING THE PAST, AND CARRYING HER OUT OF HERSELF.

SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY OTHER ANXIETY TO SUCCEED DIRECTLY TO THE PLACE
IN HER MIND WHICH HARRIET HAD OCCUPIED.  THERE WAS A COMMUNICATION
BEFORE HER, ONE WHICH _SHE_ ONLY COULD BE COMPETENT TO MAKE--
THE CONFESSION OF HER ENGAGEMENT TO HER FATHER; BUT SHE WOULD
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AT PRESENT.--SHE HAD RESOLVED TO DEFER
THE DISCLOSURE TILL MRS. WESTON WERE SAFE AND WELL.  NO ADDITIONAL
AGITATION SHOULD BE THROWN AT THIS PERIOD AMONG THOSE SHE LOVED--
AND THE EVIL SHOULD NOT ACT ON HERSELF BY ANTICIPATION BEFORE THE
APPOINTED TIME.--A FORTNIGHT, AT LEAST, OF LEISURE AND PEACE OF MIND,
TO CROWN EVERY WARMER, BUT MORE AGITATING, DELIGHT, SHOULD BE HERS.

SHE SOON RESOLVED, EQUALLY AS A DUTY AND A PLEASURE, TO EMPLOY HALF
AN HOUR OF THIS HOLIDAY OF SPIRITS IN CALLING ON MISS FAIRFAX.--
SHE OUGHT TO GO--AND SHE WAS LONGING TO SEE HER; THE RESEMBLANCE OF
THEIR PRESENT SITUATIONS INCREASING EVERY OTHER MOTIVE OF GOODWILL.
IT WOULD BE A _SECRET_ SATISFACTION; BUT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A
SIMILARITY OF PROSPECT WOULD CERTAINLY ADD TO THE INTEREST WITH
WHICH SHE SHOULD ATTEND TO ANY THING JANE MIGHT COMMUNICATE.

SHE WENT--SHE HAD DRIVEN ONCE UNSUCCESSFULLY TO THE DOOR, BUT HAD
NOT BEEN INTO THE HOUSE SINCE THE MORNING AFTER BOX HILL, WHEN POOR
JANE HAD BEEN IN SUCH DISTRESS AS HAD FILLED HER WITH COMPASSION,
THOUGH ALL THE WORST OF HER SUFFERINGS HAD BEEN UNSUSPECTED.--
THE FEAR OF BEING STILL UNWELCOME, DETERMINED HER, THOUGH ASSURED
OF THEIR BEING AT HOME, TO WAIT IN THE PASSAGE, AND SEND UP HER NAME.--
SHE HEARD PATTY ANNOUNCING IT; BUT NO SUCH BUSTLE SUCCEEDED AS POOR
MISS BATES HAD BEFORE MADE SO HAPPILY INTELLIGIBLE.--NO; SHE HEARD
NOTHING BUT THE INSTANT REPLY OF, "BEG HER TO WALK UP;"--AND A MOMENT
AFTERWARDS SHE WAS MET ON THE STAIRS BY JANE HERSELF, COMING EAGERLY
FORWARD, AS IF NO OTHER RECEPTION OF HER WERE FELT SUFFICIENT.--
EMMA HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK SO WELL, SO LOVELY, SO ENGAGING.
THERE WAS CONSCIOUSNESS, ANIMATION, AND WARMTH; THERE WAS EVERY
THING WHICH HER COUNTENANCE OR MANNER COULD EVER HAVE WANTED.--
SHE CAME FORWARD WITH AN OFFERED HAND; AND SAID, IN A LOW, BUT VERY
FEELING TONE,

"THIS IS MOST KIND, INDEED!--MISS WOODHOUSE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ME TO EXPRESS--I HOPE YOU WILL BELIEVE--EXCUSE ME FOR BEING
SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT WORDS."

EMMA WAS GRATIFIED, AND WOULD SOON HAVE SHEWN NO WANT OF WORDS,
IF THE SOUND OF MRS. ELTON'S VOICE FROM THE SITTING-ROOM HAD NOT
CHECKED HER, AND MADE IT EXPEDIENT TO COMPRESS ALL HER FRIENDLY
AND ALL HER CONGRATULATORY SENSATIONS INTO A VERY, VERY EARNEST
SHAKE OF THE HAND.

MRS. BATES AND MRS. ELTON WERE TOGETHER.  MISS BATES WAS OUT,
WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE PREVIOUS TRANQUILLITY.  EMMA COULD HAVE
WISHED MRS. ELTON ELSEWHERE; BUT SHE WAS IN A HUMOUR TO HAVE PATIENCE
WITH EVERY BODY; AND AS MRS. ELTON MET HER WITH UNUSUAL GRACIOUSNESS,
SHE HOPED THE RENCONTRE WOULD DO THEM NO HARM.

SHE SOON BELIEVED HERSELF TO PENETRATE MRS. ELTON'S THOUGHTS,
AND UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WAS, LIKE HERSELF, IN HAPPY SPIRITS;
IT WAS BEING IN MISS FAIRFAX'S CONFIDENCE, AND FANCYING HERSELF
ACQUAINTED WITH WHAT WAS STILL A SECRET TO OTHER PEOPLE.
EMMA SAW SYMPTOMS OF IT IMMEDIATELY IN THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE;
AND WHILE PAYING HER OWN COMPLIMENTS TO MRS. BATES, AND APPEARING
TO ATTEND TO THE GOOD OLD LADY'S REPLIES, SHE SAW HER WITH A SORT
OF ANXIOUS PARADE OF MYSTERY FOLD UP A LETTER WHICH SHE HAD APPARENTLY
BEEN READING ALOUD TO MISS FAIRFAX, AND RETURN IT INTO THE PURPLE
AND GOLD RETICULE BY HER SIDE, SAYING, WITH SIGNIFICANT NODS,

"WE CAN FINISH THIS SOME OTHER TIME, YOU KNOW.  YOU AND I SHALL
NOT WANT OPPORTUNITIES.  AND, IN FACT, YOU HAVE HEARD ALL THE
ESSENTIAL ALREADY.  I ONLY WANTED TO PROVE TO YOU THAT MRS. S. ADMITS
OUR APOLOGY, AND IS NOT OFFENDED.  YOU SEE HOW DELIGHTFULLY
SHE WRITES.  OH! SHE IS A SWEET CREATURE!  YOU WOULD HAVE DOATED
ON HER, HAD YOU GONE.--BUT NOT A WORD MORE.  LET US BE DISCREET--
QUITE ON OUR GOOD BEHAVIOUR.--HUSH!--YOU REMEMBER THOSE LINES--
I FORGET THE POEM AT THIS MOMENT:

        "FOR WHEN A LADY'S IN THE CASE,
        "YOU KNOW ALL OTHER THINGS GIVE PLACE."

NOW I SAY, MY DEAR, IN _OUR_ CASE, FOR _LADY_, READ----MUM! A WORD
TO THE WISE.--I AM IN A FINE FLOW OF SPIRITS, AN'T I?  BUT I WANT
TO SET YOUR HEART AT EASE AS TO MRS. S.--_MY_ REPRESENTATION, YOU SEE,
HAS QUITE APPEASED HER."

AND AGAIN, ON EMMA'S MERELY TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK
AT MRS. BATES'S KNITTING, SHE ADDED, IN A HALF WHISPER,

"I MENTIONED NO _NAMES_, YOU WILL OBSERVE.--OH! NO; CAUTIOUS AS
A MINISTER OF STATE.  I MANAGED IT EXTREMELY WELL."

EMMA COULD NOT DOUBT.  IT WAS A PALPABLE DISPLAY, REPEATED ON EVERY
POSSIBLE OCCASION.  WHEN THEY HAD ALL TALKED A LITTLE WHILE IN HARMONY
OF THE WEATHER AND MRS. WESTON, SHE FOUND HERSELF ABRUPTLY ADDRESSED WITH,

"DO NOT YOU THINK, MISS WOODHOUSE, OUR SAUCY LITTLE FRIEND HERE IS
CHARMINGLY RECOVERED?--DO NOT YOU THINK HER CURE DOES PERRY THE
HIGHEST CREDIT?--(HERE WAS A SIDE-GLANCE OF GREAT MEANING AT JANE.)
UPON MY WORD, PERRY HAS RESTORED HER IN A WONDERFUL SHORT TIME!--
OH! IF YOU HAD SEEN HER, AS I DID, WHEN SHE WAS AT THE WORST!"--
AND WHEN MRS. BATES WAS SAYING SOMETHING TO EMMA, WHISPERED FARTHER,
"WE DO NOT SAY A WORD OF ANY _ASSISTANCE_ THAT PERRY MIGHT HAVE;
NOT A WORD OF A CERTAIN YOUNG PHYSICIAN FROM WINDSOR.--OH! NO;
PERRY SHALL HAVE ALL THE CREDIT."

"I HAVE SCARCE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE,"
SHE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BEGAN, "SINCE THE PARTY TO BOX HILL.
VERY PLEASANT PARTY.  BUT YET I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING WANTING.
THINGS DID NOT SEEM--THAT IS, THERE SEEMED A LITTLE CLOUD UPON
THE SPIRITS OF SOME.--SO IT APPEARED TO ME AT LEAST, BUT I MIGHT
BE MISTAKEN.  HOWEVER, I THINK IT ANSWERED SO FAR AS TO TEMPT ONE
TO GO AGAIN.  WHAT SAY YOU BOTH TO OUR COLLECTING THE SAME PARTY,
AND EXPLORING TO BOX HILL AGAIN, WHILE THE FINE WEATHER LASTS?--
IT MUST BE THE SAME PARTY, YOU KNOW, QUITE THE SAME PARTY,
NOT _ONE_ EXCEPTION."

SOON AFTER THIS MISS BATES CAME IN, AND EMMA COULD NOT HELP BEING DIVERTED
BY THE PERPLEXITY OF HER FIRST ANSWER TO HERSELF, RESULTING, SHE SUPPOSED,
FROM DOUBT OF WHAT MIGHT BE SAID, AND IMPATIENCE TO SAY EVERY THING.

"THANK YOU, DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU ARE ALL KINDNESS.--IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO SAY--YES, INDEED, I QUITE UNDERSTAND--DEAREST JANE'S PROSPECTS--
THAT IS, I DO NOT MEAN.--BUT SHE IS CHARMINGLY RECOVERED.--
HOW IS MR. WOODHOUSE?--I AM SO GLAD.--QUITE OUT OF MY POWER.--
SUCH A HAPPY LITTLE CIRCLE AS YOU FIND US HERE.--YES, INDEED.--
CHARMING YOUNG MAN!--THAT IS--SO VERY FRIENDLY; I MEAN GOOD MR. PERRY!--
SUCH ATTENTION TO JANE!"--AND FROM HER GREAT, HER MORE THAN COMMONLY
THANKFUL DELIGHT TOWARDS MRS. ELTON FOR BEING THERE, EMMA GUESSED
THAT THERE HAD BEEN A LITTLE SHOW OF RESENTMENT TOWARDS JANE,
FROM THE VICARAGE QUARTER, WHICH WAS NOW GRACIOUSLY OVERCOME.--
AFTER A FEW WHISPERS, INDEED, WHICH PLACED IT BEYOND A GUESS,
MRS. ELTON, SPEAKING LOUDER, SAID,

"YES, HERE I AM, MY GOOD FRIEND; AND HERE I HAVE BEEN SO LONG,
THAT ANYWHERE ELSE I SHOULD THINK IT NECESSARY TO APOLOGISE;
BUT, THE TRUTH IS, THAT I AM WAITING FOR MY LORD AND MASTER.
HE PROMISED TO JOIN ME HERE, AND PAY HIS RESPECTS TO YOU."

"WHAT! ARE WE TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF A CALL FROM MR. ELTON?--
THAT WILL BE A FAVOUR INDEED! FOR I KNOW GENTLEMEN DO NOT LIKE
MORNING VISITS, AND MR. ELTON'S TIME IS SO ENGAGED."

"UPON MY WORD IT IS, MISS BATES.--HE REALLY IS ENGAGED FROM MORNING
TO NIGHT.--THERE IS NO END OF PEOPLE'S COMING TO HIM, ON SOME PRETENCE
OR OTHER.--THE MAGISTRATES, AND OVERSEERS, AND CHURCHWARDENS,
ARE ALWAYS WANTING HIS OPINION.  THEY SEEM NOT ABLE TO DO ANY THING
WITHOUT HIM.--`UPON MY WORD, MR. E.,' I OFTEN SAY, `RATHER YOU THAN I.--
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WOULD BECOME OF MY CRAYONS AND MY INSTRUMENT,
IF I HAD HALF SO MANY APPLICANTS.'--BAD ENOUGH AS IT IS, FOR I
ABSOLUTELY NEGLECT THEM BOTH TO AN UNPARDONABLE DEGREE.--I BELIEVE
I HAVE NOT PLAYED A BAR THIS FORTNIGHT.--HOWEVER, HE IS COMING,
I ASSURE YOU:  YES, INDEED, ON PURPOSE TO WAIT ON YOU ALL."  AND PUTTING
UP HER HAND TO SCREEN HER WORDS FROM EMMA--"A CONGRATULATORY VISIT,
YOU KNOW.--OH! YES, QUITE INDISPENSABLE."

MISS BATES LOOKED ABOUT HER, SO HAPPILY!--

"HE PROMISED TO COME TO ME AS SOON AS HE COULD DISENGAGE HIMSELF
FROM KNIGHTLEY; BUT HE AND KNIGHTLEY ARE SHUT UP TOGETHER
IN DEEP CONSULTATION.--MR. E. IS KNIGHTLEY'S RIGHT HAND."

EMMA WOULD NOT HAVE SMILED FOR THE WORLD, AND ONLY SAID, "IS MR. ELTON
GONE ON FOOT TO DONWELL?--HE WILL HAVE A HOT WALK."

"OH! NO, IT IS A MEETING AT THE CROWN, A REGULAR MEETING.
WESTON AND COLE WILL BE THERE TOO; BUT ONE IS APT TO SPEAK ONLY
OF THOSE WHO LEAD.--I FANCY MR. E. AND KNIGHTLEY HAVE EVERY THING
THEIR OWN WAY."

"HAVE NOT YOU MISTAKEN THE DAY?" SAID EMMA.  "I AM ALMOST CERTAIN
THAT THE MEETING AT THE CROWN IS NOT TILL TO-MORROW.--MR. KNIGHTLEY
WAS AT HARTFIELD YESTERDAY, AND SPOKE OF IT AS FOR SATURDAY."

"OH! NO, THE MEETING IS CERTAINLY TO-DAY," WAS THE ABRUPT ANSWER,
WHICH DENOTED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ANY BLUNDER ON MRS. ELTON'S SIDE.--
"I DO BELIEVE," SHE CONTINUED, "THIS IS THE MOST TROUBLESOME PARISH
THAT EVER WAS.  WE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH THINGS AT MAPLE GROVE."

"YOUR PARISH THERE WAS SMALL," SAID JANE.

"UPON MY WORD, MY DEAR, I DO NOT KNOW, FOR I NEVER HEARD THE SUBJECT
TALKED OF."

"BUT IT IS PROVED BY THE SMALLNESS OF THE SCHOOL, WHICH I HAVE HEARD
YOU SPEAK OF, AS UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF YOUR SISTER AND MRS. BRAGGE;
THE ONLY SCHOOL, AND NOT MORE THAN FIVE-AND-TWENTY CHILDREN."

"AH! YOU CLEVER CREATURE, THAT'S VERY TRUE.  WHAT A THINKING BRAIN
YOU HAVE!  I SAY, JANE, WHAT A PERFECT CHARACTER YOU AND I SHOULD MAKE,
IF WE COULD BE SHAKEN TOGETHER.  MY LIVELINESS AND YOUR SOLIDITY
WOULD PRODUCE PERFECTION.--NOT THAT I PRESUME TO INSINUATE, HOWEVER,
THAT _SOME_ PEOPLE MAY NOT THINK _YOU_ PERFECTION ALREADY.--BUT HUSH!--
NOT A WORD, IF YOU PLEASE."

IT SEEMED AN UNNECESSARY CAUTION; JANE WAS WANTING TO GIVE HER WORDS,
NOT TO MRS. ELTON, BUT TO MISS WOODHOUSE, AS THE LATTER PLAINLY SAW.
THE WISH OF DISTINGUISHING HER, AS FAR AS CIVILITY PERMITTED,
WAS VERY EVIDENT, THOUGH IT COULD NOT OFTEN PROCEED BEYOND A LOOK.

MR. ELTON MADE HIS APPEARANCE.  HIS LADY GREETED HIM WITH SOME
OF HER SPARKLING VIVACITY.

"VERY PRETTY, SIR, UPON MY WORD; TO SEND ME ON HERE, TO BE AN
ENCUMBRANCE TO MY FRIENDS, SO LONG BEFORE YOU VOUCHSAFE TO COME!--
BUT YOU KNEW WHAT A DUTIFUL CREATURE YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH.
YOU KNEW I SHOULD NOT STIR TILL MY LORD AND MASTER APPEARED.--
HERE HAVE I BEEN SITTING THIS HOUR, GIVING THESE YOUNG LADIES
A SAMPLE OF TRUE CONJUGAL OBEDIENCE--FOR WHO CAN SAY, YOU KNOW,
HOW SOON IT MAY BE WANTED?"

MR. ELTON WAS SO HOT AND TIRED, THAT ALL THIS WIT SEEMED THROWN AWAY.
HIS CIVILITIES TO THE OTHER LADIES MUST BE PAID; BUT HIS SUBSEQUENT
OBJECT WAS TO LAMENT OVER HIMSELF FOR THE HEAT HE WAS SUFFERING,
AND THE WALK HE HAD HAD FOR NOTHING.

"WHEN I GOT TO DONWELL," SAID HE, "KNIGHTLEY COULD NOT BE FOUND.
VERY ODD! VERY UNACCOUNTABLE! AFTER THE NOTE I SENT HIM THIS MORNING,
AND THE MESSAGE HE RETURNED, THAT HE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE AT HOME
TILL ONE."

"DONWELL!" CRIED HIS WIFE.--"MY DEAR MR. E., YOU HAVE NOT BEEN
TO DONWELL!--YOU MEAN THE CROWN; YOU COME FROM THE MEETING AT THE CROWN."

"NO, NO, THAT'S TO-MORROW; AND I PARTICULARLY WANTED TO SEE KNIGHTLEY
TO-DAY ON THAT VERY ACCOUNT.--SUCH A DREADFUL BROILING MORNING!--
I WENT OVER THE FIELDS TOO--(SPEAKING IN A TONE OF GREAT ILL-USAGE,)
WHICH MADE IT SO MUCH THE WORSE.  AND THEN NOT TO FIND HIM AT HOME!
I ASSURE YOU I AM NOT AT ALL PLEASED.  AND NO APOLOGY LEFT, NO MESSAGE
FOR ME.  THE HOUSEKEEPER DECLARED SHE KNEW NOTHING OF MY BEING EXPECTED.--
VERY EXTRAORDINARY!--AND NOBODY KNEW AT ALL WHICH WAY HE WAS GONE.
PERHAPS TO HARTFIELD, PERHAPS TO THE ABBEY MILL, PERHAPS INTO HIS WOODS.--
MISS WOODHOUSE, THIS IS NOT LIKE OUR FRIEND KNIGHTLEY!--CAN YOU
EXPLAIN IT?"

EMMA AMUSED HERSELF BY PROTESTING THAT IT WAS VERY EXTRAORDINARY,
INDEED, AND THAT SHE HAD NOT A SYLLABLE TO SAY FOR HIM.

"I CANNOT IMAGINE," SAID MRS. ELTON, (FEELING THE INDIGNITY AS A WIFE
OUGHT TO DO,) "I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HE COULD DO SUCH A THING BY YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD!  THE VERY LAST PERSON WHOM ONE SHOULD EXPECT
TO BE FORGOTTEN!--MY DEAR MR. E., HE MUST HAVE LEFT A MESSAGE FOR YOU,
I AM SURE HE MUST.--NOT EVEN KNIGHTLEY COULD BE SO VERY ECCENTRIC;--
AND HIS SERVANTS FORGOT IT.  DEPEND UPON IT, THAT WAS THE CASE:
AND VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN WITH THE DONWELL SERVANTS, WHO ARE ALL,
I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED, EXTREMELY AWKWARD AND REMISS.--I AM SURE I
WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH A CREATURE AS HIS HARRY STAND AT OUR SIDEBOARD
FOR ANY CONSIDERATION.  AND AS FOR MRS. HODGES, WRIGHT HOLDS
HER VERY CHEAP INDEED.--SHE PROMISED WRIGHT A RECEIPT, AND NEVER
SENT IT."

"I MET WILLIAM LARKINS," CONTINUED MR. ELTON, "AS I GOT NEAR
THE HOUSE, AND HE TOLD ME I SHOULD NOT FIND HIS MASTER AT HOME,
BUT I DID NOT BELIEVE HIM.--WILLIAM SEEMED RATHER OUT OF HUMOUR.
HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS COME TO HIS MASTER LATELY, HE SAID, BUT HE
COULD HARDLY EVER GET THE SPEECH OF HIM.  I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
WILLIAM'S WANTS, BUT IT REALLY IS OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT _I_
SHOULD SEE KNIGHTLEY TO-DAY; AND IT BECOMES A MATTER, THEREFORE,
OF VERY SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS HOT WALK
TO NO PURPOSE."

EMMA FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN GO HOME DIRECTLY.
IN ALL PROBABILITY SHE WAS AT THIS VERY TIME WAITED FOR THERE;
AND MR. KNIGHTLEY MIGHT BE PRESERVED FROM SINKING DEEPER IN AGGRESSION
TOWARDS MR. ELTON, IF NOT TOWARDS WILLIAM LARKINS.

SHE WAS PLEASED, ON TAKING LEAVE, TO FIND MISS FAIRFAX DETERMINED
TO ATTEND HER OUT OF THE ROOM, TO GO WITH HER EVEN DOWNSTAIRS;
IT GAVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH SHE IMMEDIATELY MADE USE OF,
TO SAY,

"IT IS AS WELL, PERHAPS, THAT I HAVE NOT HAD THE POSSIBILITY.
HAD YOU NOT BEEN SURROUNDED BY OTHER FRIENDS, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
TEMPTED TO INTRODUCE A SUBJECT, TO ASK QUESTIONS, TO SPEAK MORE
OPENLY THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN STRICTLY CORRECT.--I FEEL THAT I SHOULD
CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN IMPERTINENT."

"OH!" CRIED JANE, WITH A BLUSH AND AN HESITATION WHICH EMMA THOUGHT
INFINITELY MORE BECOMING TO HER THAN ALL THE ELEGANCE OF ALL HER
USUAL COMPOSURE--"THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DANGER.  THE DANGER
WOULD HAVE BEEN OF MY WEARYING YOU.  YOU COULD NOT HAVE GRATIFIED
ME MORE THAN BY EXPRESSING AN INTEREST--.  INDEED, MISS WOODHOUSE,
(SPEAKING MORE COLLECTEDLY,) WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH I
HAVE OF MISCONDUCT, VERY GREAT MISCONDUCT, IT IS PARTICULARLY
CONSOLING TO ME TO KNOW THAT THOSE OF MY FRIENDS, WHOSE GOOD
OPINION IS MOST WORTH PRESERVING, ARE NOT DISGUSTED TO SUCH A
DEGREE AS TO--I HAVE NOT TIME FOR HALF THAT I COULD WISH TO SAY.
I LONG TO MAKE APOLOGIES, EXCUSES, TO URGE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF.
I FEEL IT SO VERY DUE.  BUT, UNFORTUNATELY--IN SHORT, IF YOUR
COMPASSION DOES NOT STAND MY FRIEND--"

"OH! YOU ARE TOO SCRUPULOUS, INDEED YOU ARE," CRIED EMMA WARMLY,
AND TAKING HER HAND.  "YOU OWE ME NO APOLOGIES; AND EVERY BODY TO
WHOM YOU MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO OWE THEM, IS SO PERFECTLY SATISFIED,
SO DELIGHTED EVEN--"

"YOU ARE VERY KIND, BUT I KNOW WHAT MY MANNERS WERE TO YOU.--
SO COLD AND ARTIFICIAL!--I HAD ALWAYS A PART TO ACT.--IT WAS A LIFE
OF DECEIT!--I KNOW THAT I MUST HAVE DISGUSTED YOU."

"PRAY SAY NO MORE.  I FEEL THAT ALL THE APOLOGIES SHOULD BE ON MY SIDE.
LET US FORGIVE EACH OTHER AT ONCE.  WE MUST DO WHATEVER IS TO BE
DONE QUICKEST, AND I THINK OUR FEELINGS WILL LOSE NO TIME THERE.
I HOPE YOU HAVE PLEASANT ACCOUNTS FROM WINDSOR?"

"VERY."

"AND THE NEXT NEWS, I SUPPOSE, WILL BE, THAT WE ARE TO LOSE YOU--
JUST AS I BEGIN TO KNOW YOU."

"OH! AS TO ALL THAT, OF COURSE NOTHING CAN BE THOUGHT OF YET.
I AM HERE TILL CLAIMED BY COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL."

"NOTHING CAN BE ACTUALLY SETTLED YET, PERHAPS," REPLIED EMMA,
SMILING--"BUT, EXCUSE ME, IT MUST BE THOUGHT OF."

THE SMILE WAS RETURNED AS JANE ANSWERED,

"YOU ARE VERY RIGHT; IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT OF.  AND I WILL OWN
TO YOU, (I AM SURE IT WILL BE SAFE), THAT SO FAR AS OUR LIVING
WITH MR. CHURCHILL AT ENSCOMBE, IT IS SETTLED.  THERE MUST BE
THREE MONTHS, AT LEAST, OF DEEP MOURNING; BUT WHEN THEY ARE OVER,
I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE NOTHING MORE TO WAIT FOR."

"THANK YOU, THANK YOU.--THIS IS JUST WHAT I WANTED TO BE ASSURED OF.--
OH! IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH I LOVE EVERY THING THAT IS DECIDED AND OPEN!--
GOOD-BYE, GOOD-BYE."



CHAPTER XVII


MRS. WESTON'S FRIENDS WERE ALL MADE HAPPY BY HER SAFETY;
AND IF THE SATISFACTION OF HER WELL-DOING COULD BE INCREASED
TO EMMA, IT WAS BY KNOWING HER TO BE THE MOTHER OF A LITTLE GIRL.
SHE HAD BEEN DECIDED IN WISHING FOR A MISS WESTON.  SHE WOULD
NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS WITH ANY VIEW OF MAKING A MATCH
FOR HER, HEREAFTER, WITH EITHER OF ISABELLA'S SONS; BUT SHE WAS
CONVINCED THAT A DAUGHTER WOULD SUIT BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER BEST.
IT WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT TO MR. WESTON, AS HE GREW OLDER--
AND EVEN MR. WESTON MIGHT BE GROWING OLDER TEN YEARS HENCE--TO HAVE
HIS FIRESIDE ENLIVENED BY THE SPORTS AND THE NONSENSE, THE FREAKS
AND THE FANCIES OF A CHILD NEVER BANISHED FROM HOME; AND MRS. WESTON--
NO ONE COULD DOUBT THAT A DAUGHTER WOULD BE MOST TO HER; AND IT
WOULD BE QUITE A PITY THAT ANY ONE WHO SO WELL KNEW HOW TO TEACH,
SHOULD NOT HAVE THEIR POWERS IN EXERCISE AGAIN.

"SHE HAS HAD THE ADVANTAGE, YOU KNOW, OF PRACTISING ON ME,"
SHE CONTINUED--"LIKE LA BARONNE D'ALMANE ON LA COMTESSE D'OSTALIS,
IN MADAME DE GENLIS' ADELAIDE AND THEODORE, AND WE SHALL NOW SEE
HER OWN LITTLE ADELAIDE EDUCATED ON A MORE PERFECT PLAN."

"THAT IS," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY, "SHE WILL INDULGE HER EVEN MORE
THAN SHE DID YOU, AND BELIEVE THAT SHE DOES NOT INDULGE HER AT ALL.
IT WILL BE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE."

"POOR CHILD!" CRIED EMMA; "AT THAT RATE, WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER?"

"NOTHING VERY BAD.--THE FATE OF THOUSANDS.  SHE WILL BE DISAGREEABLE
IN INFANCY, AND CORRECT HERSELF AS SHE GROWS OLDER.  I AM LOSING
ALL MY BITTERNESS AGAINST SPOILT CHILDREN, MY DEAREST EMMA.
I, WHO AM OWING ALL MY HAPPINESS TO _YOU_, WOULD NOT IT BE HORRIBLE
INGRATITUDE IN ME TO BE SEVERE ON THEM?"

EMMA LAUGHED, AND REPLIED:  "BUT I HAD THE ASSISTANCE OF ALL
YOUR ENDEAVOURS TO COUNTERACT THE INDULGENCE OF OTHER PEOPLE.
I DOUBT WHETHER MY OWN SENSE WOULD HAVE CORRECTED ME WITHOUT IT."

"DO YOU?--I HAVE NO DOUBT.  NATURE GAVE YOU UNDERSTANDING:--
MISS TAYLOR GAVE YOU PRINCIPLES.  YOU MUST HAVE DONE WELL.
MY INTERFERENCE WAS QUITE AS LIKELY TO DO HARM AS GOOD.  IT WAS
VERY NATURAL FOR YOU TO SAY, WHAT RIGHT HAS HE TO LECTURE ME?--
AND I AM AFRAID VERY NATURAL FOR YOU TO FEEL THAT IT WAS DONE
IN A DISAGREEABLE MANNER.  I DO NOT BELIEVE I DID YOU ANY GOOD.
THE GOOD WAS ALL TO MYSELF, BY MAKING YOU AN OBJECT OF THE TENDEREST
AFFECTION TO ME.  I COULD NOT THINK ABOUT YOU SO MUCH WITHOUT DOATING
ON YOU, FAULTS AND ALL; AND BY DINT OF FANCYING SO MANY ERRORS,
HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU EVER SINCE YOU WERE THIRTEEN AT LEAST."

"I AM SURE YOU WERE OF USE TO ME," CRIED EMMA.  "I WAS VERY OFTEN
INFLUENCED RIGHTLY BY YOU--OFTENER THAN I WOULD OWN AT THE TIME.
I AM VERY SURE YOU DID ME GOOD.  AND IF POOR LITTLE ANNA WESTON IS
TO BE SPOILED, IT WILL BE THE GREATEST HUMANITY IN YOU TO DO AS MUCH
FOR HER AS YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME, EXCEPT FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER
WHEN SHE IS THIRTEEN."

"HOW OFTEN, WHEN YOU WERE A GIRL, HAVE YOU SAID TO ME, WITH ONE
OF YOUR SAUCY LOOKS--`MR. KNIGHTLEY, I AM GOING TO DO SO-AND-SO;
PAPA SAYS I MAY, OR I HAVE MISS TAYLOR'S LEAVE'--SOMETHING WHICH,
YOU KNEW, I DID NOT APPROVE.  IN SUCH CASES MY INTERFERENCE WAS GIVING
YOU TWO BAD FEELINGS INSTEAD OF ONE."

"WHAT AN AMIABLE CREATURE I WAS!--NO WONDER YOU SHOULD HOLD
MY SPEECHES IN SUCH AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE."

"`MR. KNIGHTLEY.'--YOU ALWAYS CALLED ME, `MR. KNIGHTLEY;' AND,
FROM HABIT, IT HAS NOT SO VERY FORMAL A SOUND.--AND YET IT IS FORMAL.
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME SOMETHING ELSE, BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT."

"I REMEMBER ONCE CALLING YOU `GEORGE,' IN ONE OF MY AMIABLE FITS,
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO.  I DID IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD OFFEND YOU;
BUT, AS YOU MADE NO OBJECTION, I NEVER DID IT AGAIN."

"AND CANNOT YOU CALL ME `GEORGE' NOW?"

"IMPOSSIBLE!--I NEVER CAN CALL YOU ANY THING BUT `MR. KNIGHTLEY.'
I WILL NOT PROMISE EVEN TO EQUAL THE ELEGANT TERSENESS OF MRS. ELTON,
BY CALLING YOU MR. K.--BUT I WILL PROMISE," SHE ADDED PRESENTLY,
LAUGHING AND BLUSHING--"I WILL PROMISE TO CALL YOU ONCE BY YOUR
CHRISTIAN NAME.  I DO NOT SAY WHEN, BUT PERHAPS YOU MAY GUESS
WHERE;--IN THE BUILDING IN WHICH N. TAKES M. FOR BETTER, FOR WORSE."

EMMA GRIEVED THAT SHE COULD NOT BE MORE OPENLY JUST TO ONE
IMPORTANT SERVICE WHICH HIS BETTER SENSE WOULD HAVE RENDERED HER,
TO THE ADVICE WHICH WOULD HAVE SAVED HER FROM THE WORST OF ALL
HER WOMANLY FOLLIES--HER WILFUL INTIMACY WITH HARRIET SMITH;
BUT IT WAS TOO TENDER A SUBJECT.--SHE COULD NOT ENTER ON IT.--
HARRIET WAS VERY SELDOM MENTIONED BETWEEN THEM.  THIS, ON HIS SIDE,
MIGHT MERELY PROCEED FROM HER NOT BEING THOUGHT OF; BUT EMMA
WAS RATHER INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO DELICACY, AND A SUSPICION,
FROM SOME APPEARANCES, THAT THEIR FRIENDSHIP WERE DECLINING.
SHE WAS AWARE HERSELF, THAT, PARTING UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES,
THEY CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE CORRESPONDED MORE, AND THAT HER
INTELLIGENCE WOULD NOT HAVE RESTED, AS IT NOW ALMOST WHOLLY DID,
ON ISABELLA'S LETTERS.  HE MIGHT OBSERVE THAT IT WAS SO.  THE PAIN
OF BEING OBLIGED TO PRACTISE CONCEALMENT TOWARDS HIM, WAS VERY LITTLE
INFERIOR TO THE PAIN OF HAVING MADE HARRIET UNHAPPY.

ISABELLA SENT QUITE AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF HER VISITOR AS COULD
BE EXPECTED; ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL SHE HAD THOUGHT HER OUT OF SPIRITS,
WHICH APPEARED PERFECTLY NATURAL, AS THERE WAS A DENTIST TO
BE CONSULTED; BUT, SINCE THAT BUSINESS HAD BEEN OVER, SHE DID NOT
APPEAR TO FIND HARRIET DIFFERENT FROM WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN HER BEFORE.--
ISABELLA, TO BE SURE, WAS NO VERY QUICK OBSERVER; YET IF HARRIET
HAD NOT BEEN EQUAL TO PLAYING WITH THE CHILDREN, IT WOULD NOT HAVE
ESCAPED HER.  EMMA'S COMFORTS AND HOPES WERE MOST AGREEABLY CARRIED ON,
BY HARRIET'S BEING TO STAY LONGER; HER FORTNIGHT WAS LIKELY TO BE
A MONTH AT LEAST.  MR. AND MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WERE TO COME DOWN
IN AUGUST, AND SHE WAS INVITED TO REMAIN TILL THEY COULD BRING HER BACK.

"JOHN DOES NOT EVEN MENTION YOUR FRIEND," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY.
"HERE IS HIS ANSWER, IF YOU LIKE TO SEE IT."

IT WAS THE ANSWER TO THE COMMUNICATION OF HIS INTENDED MARRIAGE.
EMMA ACCEPTED IT WITH A VERY EAGER HAND, WITH AN IMPATIENCE ALL ALIVE
TO KNOW WHAT HE WOULD SAY ABOUT IT, AND NOT AT ALL CHECKED BY HEARING
THAT HER FRIEND WAS UNMENTIONED.

"JOHN ENTERS LIKE A BROTHER INTO MY HAPPINESS," CONTINUED MR. KNIGHTLEY,
"BUT HE IS NO COMPLIMENTER; AND THOUGH I WELL KNOW HIM TO HAVE,
LIKEWISE, A MOST BROTHERLY AFFECTION FOR YOU, HE IS SO FAR FROM
MAKING FLOURISHES, THAT ANY OTHER YOUNG WOMAN MIGHT THINK HIM RATHER
COOL IN HER PRAISE.  BUT I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOUR SEEING WHAT HE WRITES."

"HE WRITES LIKE A SENSIBLE MAN," REPLIED EMMA, WHEN SHE HAD READ
THE LETTER.  "I HONOUR HIS SINCERITY.  IT IS VERY PLAIN THAT HE
CONSIDERS THE GOOD FORTUNE OF THE ENGAGEMENT AS ALL ON MY SIDE,
BUT THAT HE IS NOT WITHOUT HOPE OF MY GROWING, IN TIME, AS WORTHY
OF YOUR AFFECTION, AS YOU THINK ME ALREADY.  HAD HE SAID ANY THING
TO BEAR A DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION, I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HIM."

"MY EMMA, HE MEANS NO SUCH THING.  HE ONLY MEANS--"

"HE AND I SHOULD DIFFER VERY LITTLE IN OUR ESTIMATION OF THE TWO,"
INTERRUPTED SHE, WITH A SORT OF SERIOUS SMILE--"MUCH LESS, PERHAPS,
THAN HE IS AWARE OF, IF WE COULD ENTER WITHOUT CEREMONY OR RESERVE
ON THE SUBJECT."

"EMMA, MY DEAR EMMA--"

"OH!" SHE CRIED WITH MORE THOROUGH GAIETY, "IF YOU FANCY YOUR
BROTHER DOES NOT DO ME JUSTICE, ONLY WAIT TILL MY DEAR FATHER IS IN
THE SECRET, AND HEAR HIS OPINION.  DEPEND UPON IT, HE WILL BE MUCH
FARTHER FROM DOING _YOU_ JUSTICE.  HE WILL THINK ALL THE HAPPINESS,
ALL THE ADVANTAGE, ON YOUR SIDE OF THE QUESTION; ALL THE MERIT
ON MINE.  I WISH I MAY NOT SINK INTO `POOR EMMA' WITH HIM AT ONCE.--
HIS TENDER COMPASSION TOWARDS OPPRESSED WORTH CAN GO NO FARTHER."

"AH!" HE CRIED, "I WISH YOUR FATHER MIGHT BE HALF AS EASILY CONVINCED
AS JOHN WILL BE, OF OUR HAVING EVERY RIGHT THAT EQUAL WORTH CAN GIVE,
TO BE HAPPY TOGETHER.  I AM AMUSED BY ONE PART OF JOHN'S LETTER--
DID YOU NOTICE IT?--WHERE HE SAYS, THAT MY INFORMATION DID NOT TAKE
HIM WHOLLY BY SURPRIZE, THAT HE WAS RATHER IN EXPECTATION OF HEARING
SOMETHING OF THE KIND."

"IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR BROTHER, HE ONLY MEANS SO FAR AS YOUR HAVING
SOME THOUGHTS OF MARRYING.  HE HAD NO IDEA OF ME.  HE SEEMS PERFECTLY
UNPREPARED FOR THAT."

"YES, YES--BUT I AM AMUSED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SEEN SO FAR INTO
MY FEELINGS.  WHAT HAS HE BEEN JUDGING BY?--I AM NOT CONSCIOUS
OF ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SPIRITS OR CONVERSATION THAT COULD PREPARE
HIM AT THIS TIME FOR MY MARRYING ANY MORE THAN AT ANOTHER.--
BUT IT WAS SO, I SUPPOSE.  I DARE SAY THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE WHEN I
WAS STAYING WITH THEM THE OTHER DAY.  I BELIEVE I DID NOT PLAY
WITH THE CHILDREN QUITE SO MUCH AS USUAL.  I REMEMBER ONE EVENING
THE POOR BOYS SAYING, `UNCLE SEEMS ALWAYS TIRED NOW.'"

THE TIME WAS COMING WHEN THE NEWS MUST SPREAD FARTHER, AND OTHER PERSONS'
RECEPTION OF IT TRIED.  AS SOON AS MRS. WESTON WAS SUFFICIENTLY
RECOVERED TO ADMIT MR. WOODHOUSE'S VISITS, EMMA HAVING IT IN VIEW
THAT HER GENTLE REASONINGS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN THE CAUSE,
RESOLVED FIRST TO ANNOUNCE IT AT HOME, AND THEN AT RANDALLS.--
BUT HOW TO BREAK IT TO HER FATHER AT LAST!--SHE HAD BOUND HERSELF
TO DO IT, IN SUCH AN HOUR OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S ABSENCE, OR WHEN IT
CAME TO THE POINT HER HEART WOULD HAVE FAILED HER, AND SHE MUST
HAVE PUT IT OFF; BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS TO COME AT SUCH A TIME,
AND FOLLOW UP THE BEGINNING SHE WAS TO MAKE.--SHE WAS FORCED
TO SPEAK, AND TO SPEAK CHEERFULLY TOO.  SHE MUST NOT MAKE IT A MORE
DECIDED SUBJECT OF MISERY TO HIM, BY A MELANCHOLY TONE HERSELF.
SHE MUST NOT APPEAR TO THINK IT A MISFORTUNE.--WITH ALL THE SPIRITS
SHE COULD COMMAND, SHE PREPARED HIM FIRST FOR SOMETHING STRANGE,
AND THEN, IN A FEW WORDS, SAID, THAT IF HIS CONSENT AND APPROBATION
COULD BE OBTAINED--WHICH, SHE TRUSTED, WOULD BE ATTENDED WITH
NO DIFFICULTY, SINCE IT WAS A PLAN TO PROMOTE THE HAPPINESS OF ALL--
SHE AND MR. KNIGHTLEY MEANT TO MARRY; BY WHICH MEANS HARTFIELD
WOULD RECEIVE THE CONSTANT ADDITION OF THAT PERSON'S COMPANY
WHOM SHE KNEW HE LOVED, NEXT TO HIS DAUGHTERS AND MRS. WESTON,
BEST IN THE WORLD.

POOR MAN!--IT WAS AT FIRST A CONSIDERABLE SHOCK TO HIM, AND HE TRIED
EARNESTLY TO DISSUADE HER FROM IT.  SHE WAS REMINDED, MORE THAN ONCE,
OF HAVING ALWAYS SAID SHE WOULD NEVER MARRY, AND ASSURED THAT IT
WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER FOR HER TO REMAIN SINGLE; AND TOLD OF
POOR ISABELLA, AND POOR MISS TAYLOR.--BUT IT WOULD NOT DO.  EMMA HUNG
ABOUT HIM AFFECTIONATELY, AND SMILED, AND SAID IT MUST BE SO; AND THAT
HE MUST NOT CLASS HER WITH ISABELLA AND MRS. WESTON, WHOSE MARRIAGES
TAKING THEM FROM HARTFIELD, HAD, INDEED, MADE A MELANCHOLY CHANGE:
BUT SHE WAS NOT GOING FROM HARTFIELD; SHE SHOULD BE ALWAYS THERE;
SHE WAS INTRODUCING NO CHANGE IN THEIR NUMBERS OR THEIR COMFORTS BUT
FOR THE BETTER; AND SHE WAS VERY SURE THAT HE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL
THE HAPPIER FOR HAVING MR. KNIGHTLEY ALWAYS AT HAND, WHEN HE WERE ONCE
GOT USED TO THE IDEA.--DID HE NOT LOVE MR. KNIGHTLEY VERY MUCH?--
HE WOULD NOT DENY THAT HE DID, SHE WAS SURE.--WHOM DID HE EVER WANT
TO CONSULT ON BUSINESS BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY?--WHO WAS SO USEFUL TO HIM,
WHO SO READY TO WRITE HIS LETTERS, WHO SO GLAD TO ASSIST HIM?--
WHO SO CHEERFUL, SO ATTENTIVE, SO ATTACHED TO HIM?--WOULD NOT HE
LIKE TO HAVE HIM ALWAYS ON THE SPOT?--YES.  THAT WAS ALL VERY TRUE.
MR. KNIGHTLEY COULD NOT BE THERE TOO OFTEN; HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE
HIM EVERY DAY;--BUT THEY DID SEE HIM EVERY DAY AS IT WAS.--WHY COULD
NOT THEY GO ON AS THEY HAD DONE?

MR. WOODHOUSE COULD NOT BE SOON RECONCILED; BUT THE WORST WAS OVERCOME,
THE IDEA WAS GIVEN; TIME AND CONTINUAL REPETITION MUST DO THE REST.--
TO EMMA'S ENTREATIES AND ASSURANCES SUCCEEDED MR. KNIGHTLEY'S,
WHOSE FOND PRAISE OF HER GAVE THE SUBJECT EVEN A KIND OF WELCOME;
AND HE WAS SOON USED TO BE TALKED TO BY EACH, ON EVERY FAIR OCCASION.--
THEY HAD ALL THE ASSISTANCE WHICH ISABELLA COULD GIVE, BY LETTERS
OF THE STRONGEST APPROBATION; AND MRS. WESTON WAS READY,
ON THE FIRST MEETING, TO CONSIDER THE SUBJECT IN THE MOST
SERVICEABLE LIGHT--FIRST, AS A SETTLED, AND, SECONDLY, AS A GOOD ONE--
WELL AWARE OF THE NEARLY EQUAL IMPORTANCE OF THE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS
TO MR. WOODHOUSE'S MIND.--IT WAS AGREED UPON, AS WHAT WAS TO BE;
AND EVERY BODY BY WHOM HE WAS USED TO BE GUIDED ASSURING HIM THAT
IT WOULD BE FOR HIS HAPPINESS; AND HAVING SOME FEELINGS HIMSELF
WHICH ALMOST ADMITTED IT, HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SOME TIME OR OTHER--
IN ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO, PERHAPS--IT MIGHT NOT BE SO VERY BAD
IF THE MARRIAGE DID TAKE PLACE.

MRS. WESTON WAS ACTING NO PART, FEIGNING NO FEELINGS IN ALL THAT SHE
SAID TO HIM IN FAVOUR OF THE EVENT.--SHE HAD BEEN EXTREMELY SURPRIZED,
NEVER MORE SO, THAN WHEN EMMA FIRST OPENED THE AFFAIR TO HER;
BUT SHE SAW IN IT ONLY INCREASE OF HAPPINESS TO ALL, AND HAD
NO SCRUPLE IN URGING HIM TO THE UTMOST.--SHE HAD SUCH A REGARD
FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY, AS TO THINK HE DESERVED EVEN HER DEAREST EMMA;
AND IT WAS IN EVERY RESPECT SO PROPER, SUITABLE, AND UNEXCEPTIONABLE
A CONNEXION, AND IN ONE RESPECT, ONE POINT OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE,
SO PECULIARLY ELIGIBLE, SO SINGULARLY FORTUNATE, THAT NOW IT SEEMED
AS IF EMMA COULD NOT SAFELY HAVE ATTACHED HERSELF TO ANY OTHER CREATURE,
AND THAT SHE HAD HERSELF BEEN THE STUPIDEST OF BEINGS IN NOT HAVING
THOUGHT OF IT, AND WISHED IT LONG AGO.--HOW VERY FEW OF THOSE MEN
IN A RANK OF LIFE TO ADDRESS EMMA WOULD HAVE RENOUNCED THEIR OWN
HOME FOR HARTFIELD!  AND WHO BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY COULD KNOW AND BEAR
WITH MR. WOODHOUSE, SO AS TO MAKE SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT DESIRABLE!--
THE DIFFICULTY OF DISPOSING OF POOR MR. WOODHOUSE HAD BEEN ALWAYS
FELT IN HER HUSBAND'S PLANS AND HER OWN, FOR A MARRIAGE BETWEEN FRANK
AND EMMA.  HOW TO SETTLE THE CLAIMS OF ENSCOMBE AND HARTFIELD HAD
BEEN A CONTINUAL IMPEDIMENT--LESS ACKNOWLEDGED BY MR. WESTON THAN
BY HERSELF--BUT EVEN HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FINISH THE SUBJECT
BETTER THAN BY SAYING--"THOSE MATTERS WILL TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES;
THE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL FIND A WAY."  BUT HERE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE
SHIFTED OFF IN A WILD SPECULATION ON THE FUTURE.  IT WAS ALL RIGHT,
ALL OPEN, ALL EQUAL.  NO SACRIFICE ON ANY SIDE WORTH THE NAME.
IT WAS A UNION OF THE HIGHEST PROMISE OF FELICITY IN ITSELF,
AND WITHOUT ONE REAL, RATIONAL DIFFICULTY TO OPPOSE OR DELAY IT.

MRS. WESTON, WITH HER BABY ON HER KNEE, INDULGING IN SUCH REFLECTIONS
AS THESE, WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST WOMEN IN THE WORLD.  IF ANY THING
COULD INCREASE HER DELIGHT, IT WAS PERCEIVING THAT THE BABY WOULD
SOON HAVE OUTGROWN ITS FIRST SET OF CAPS.

THE NEWS WAS UNIVERSALLY A SURPRIZE WHEREVER IT SPREAD;
AND MR. WESTON HAD HIS FIVE MINUTES SHARE OF IT; BUT FIVE MINUTES
WERE ENOUGH TO FAMILIARISE THE IDEA TO HIS QUICKNESS OF MIND.--
HE SAW THE ADVANTAGES OF THE MATCH, AND REJOICED IN THEM WITH ALL
THE CONSTANCY OF HIS WIFE; BUT THE WONDER OF IT WAS VERY SOON NOTHING;
AND BY THE END OF AN HOUR HE WAS NOT FAR FROM BELIEVING THAT HE
HAD ALWAYS FORESEEN IT.

"IT IS TO BE A SECRET, I CONCLUDE," SAID HE.  "THESE MATTERS ARE
ALWAYS A SECRET, TILL IT IS FOUND OUT THAT EVERY BODY KNOWS THEM.
ONLY LET ME BE TOLD WHEN I MAY SPEAK OUT.--I WONDER WHETHER JANE HAS
ANY SUSPICION."

HE WENT TO HIGHBURY THE NEXT MORNING, AND SATISFIED HIMSELF ON
THAT POINT.  HE TOLD HER THE NEWS.  WAS NOT SHE LIKE A DAUGHTER,
HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER?--HE MUST TELL HER; AND MISS BATES BEING PRESENT,
IT PASSED, OF COURSE, TO MRS. COLE, MRS. PERRY, AND MRS. ELTON,
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS.  IT WAS NO MORE THAN THE PRINCIPALS WERE
PREPARED FOR; THEY HAD CALCULATED FROM THE TIME OF ITS BEING KNOWN
AT RANDALLS, HOW SOON IT WOULD BE OVER HIGHBURY; AND WERE THINKING
OF THEMSELVES, AS THE EVENING WONDER IN MANY A FAMILY CIRCLE,
WITH GREAT SAGACITY.

IN GENERAL, IT WAS A VERY WELL APPROVED MATCH.  SOME MIGHT THINK HIM,
AND OTHERS MIGHT THINK HER, THE MOST IN LUCK.  ONE SET MIGHT
RECOMMEND THEIR ALL REMOVING TO DONWELL, AND LEAVING HARTFIELD
FOR THE JOHN KNIGHTLEYS; AND ANOTHER MIGHT PREDICT DISAGREEMENTS
AMONG THEIR SERVANTS; BUT YET, UPON THE WHOLE, THERE WAS NO SERIOUS
OBJECTION RAISED, EXCEPT IN ONE HABITATION, THE VICARAGE.--THERE,
THE SURPRIZE WAS NOT SOFTENED BY ANY SATISFACTION.  MR. ELTON
CARED LITTLE ABOUT IT, COMPARED WITH HIS WIFE; HE ONLY HOPED "THE
YOUNG LADY'S PRIDE WOULD NOW BE CONTENTED;" AND SUPPOSED "SHE HAD
ALWAYS MEANT TO CATCH KNIGHTLEY IF SHE COULD;" AND, ON THE POINT
OF LIVING AT HARTFIELD, COULD DARINGLY EXCLAIM, "RATHER HE THAN I!"--
BUT MRS. ELTON WAS VERY MUCH DISCOMPOSED INDEED.--"POOR KNIGHTLEY!
POOR FELLOW!--SAD BUSINESS FOR HIM.--SHE WAS EXTREMELY CONCERNED;
FOR, THOUGH VERY ECCENTRIC, HE HAD A THOUSAND GOOD QUALITIES.--
HOW COULD HE BE SO TAKEN IN?--DID NOT THINK HIM AT ALL IN LOVE--
NOT IN THE LEAST.--POOR KNIGHTLEY!--THERE WOULD BE AN END OF ALL
PLEASANT INTERCOURSE WITH HIM.--HOW HAPPY HE HAD BEEN TO COME AND DINE
WITH THEM WHENEVER THEY ASKED HIM!  BUT THAT WOULD BE ALL OVER NOW.--
POOR FELLOW!--NO MORE EXPLORING PARTIES TO DONWELL MADE FOR _HER_.
OH! NO; THERE WOULD BE A MRS. KNIGHTLEY TO THROW COLD WATER ON
EVERY THING.--EXTREMELY DISAGREEABLE!  BUT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL SORRY
THAT SHE HAD ABUSED THE HOUSEKEEPER THE OTHER DAY.--SHOCKING PLAN,
LIVING TOGETHER.  IT WOULD NEVER DO.  SHE KNEW A FAMILY NEAR MAPLE
GROVE WHO HAD TRIED IT, AND BEEN OBLIGED TO SEPARATE BEFORE THE END
OF THE FIRST QUARTER.



CHAPTER XVIII


TIME PASSED ON.  A FEW MORE TO-MORROWS, AND THE PARTY FROM LONDON
WOULD BE ARRIVING.  IT WAS AN ALARMING CHANGE; AND EMMA WAS THINKING
OF IT ONE MORNING, AS WHAT MUST BRING A GREAT DEAL TO AGITATE AND
GRIEVE HER, WHEN MR. KNIGHTLEY CAME IN, AND DISTRESSING THOUGHTS
WERE PUT BY.  AFTER THE FIRST CHAT OF PLEASURE HE WAS SILENT;
AND THEN, IN A GRAVER TONE, BEGAN WITH,

"I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU, EMMA; SOME NEWS."

"GOOD OR BAD?" SAID SHE, QUICKLY, LOOKING UP IN HIS FACE.

"I DO NOT KNOW WHICH IT OUGHT TO BE CALLED."

"OH! GOOD I AM SURE.--I SEE IT IN YOUR COUNTENANCE.  YOU ARE TRYING
NOT TO SMILE."

"I AM AFRAID," SAID HE, COMPOSING HIS FEATURES, "I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID,
MY DEAR EMMA, THAT YOU WILL NOT SMILE WHEN YOU HEAR IT."

"INDEED! BUT WHY SO?--I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE THAT ANY THING WHICH
PLEASES OR AMUSES YOU, SHOULD NOT PLEASE AND AMUSE ME TOO."

"THERE IS ONE SUBJECT," HE REPLIED, "I HOPE BUT ONE, ON WHICH
WE DO NOT THINK ALIKE."  HE PAUSED A MOMENT, AGAIN SMILING,
WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON HER FACE.  "DOES NOTHING OCCUR TO YOU?--
DO NOT YOU RECOLLECT?--HARRIET SMITH."

HER CHEEKS FLUSHED AT THE NAME, AND SHE FELT AFRAID OF SOMETHING,
THOUGH SHE KNEW NOT WHAT.

"HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HER YOURSELF THIS MORNING?" CRIED HE.
"YOU HAVE, I BELIEVE, AND KNOW THE WHOLE."

"NO, I HAVE NOT; I KNOW NOTHING; PRAY TELL ME."

"YOU ARE PREPARED FOR THE WORST, I SEE--AND VERY BAD IT IS.
HARRIET SMITH MARRIES ROBERT MARTIN."

EMMA GAVE A START, WHICH DID NOT SEEM LIKE BEING PREPARED--
AND HER EYES, IN EAGER GAZE, SAID, "NO, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!"
BUT HER LIPS WERE CLOSED.

"IT IS SO, INDEED," CONTINUED MR. KNIGHTLEY; "I HAVE IT FROM ROBERT
MARTIN HIMSELF.  HE LEFT ME NOT HALF AN HOUR AGO."

SHE WAS STILL LOOKING AT HIM WITH THE MOST SPEAKING AMAZEMENT.

"YOU LIKE IT, MY EMMA, AS LITTLE AS I FEARED.--I WISH OUR OPINIONS WERE
THE SAME.  BUT IN TIME THEY WILL.  TIME, YOU MAY BE SURE, WILL MAKE
ONE OR THE OTHER OF US THINK DIFFERENTLY; AND, IN THE MEANWHILE,
WE NEED NOT TALK MUCH ON THE SUBJECT."

"YOU MISTAKE ME, YOU QUITE MISTAKE ME," SHE REPLIED, EXERTING HERSELF.
"IT IS NOT THAT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD NOW MAKE ME UNHAPPY,
BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE IT.  IT SEEMS AN IMPOSSIBILITY!--YOU CANNOT MEAN
TO SAY, THAT HARRIET SMITH HAS ACCEPTED ROBERT MARTIN.  YOU CANNOT
MEAN THAT HE HAS EVEN PROPOSED TO HER AGAIN--YET.  YOU ONLY MEAN,
THAT HE INTENDS IT."

"I MEAN THAT HE HAS DONE IT," ANSWERED MR. KNIGHTLEY, WITH SMILING
BUT DETERMINED DECISION, "AND BEEN ACCEPTED."

"GOOD GOD!" SHE CRIED.--"WELL!"--THEN HAVING RECOURSE TO HER WORKBASKET,
IN EXCUSE FOR LEANING DOWN HER FACE, AND CONCEALING ALL THE
EXQUISITE FEELINGS OF DELIGHT AND ENTERTAINMENT WHICH SHE KNEW SHE
MUST BE EXPRESSING, SHE ADDED, "WELL, NOW TELL ME EVERY THING;
MAKE THIS INTELLIGIBLE TO ME.  HOW, WHERE, WHEN?--LET ME KNOW IT ALL.
I NEVER WAS MORE SURPRIZED--BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE ME UNHAPPY,
I ASSURE YOU.--HOW--HOW HAS IT BEEN POSSIBLE?"

"IT IS A VERY SIMPLE STORY.  HE WENT TO TOWN ON BUSINESS THREE DAYS AGO,
AND I GOT HIM TO TAKE CHARGE OF SOME PAPERS WHICH I WAS WANTING
TO SEND TO JOHN.--HE DELIVERED THESE PAPERS TO JOHN, AT HIS CHAMBERS,
AND WAS ASKED BY HIM TO JOIN THEIR PARTY THE SAME EVENING TO ASTLEY'S.
THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE THE TWO ELDEST BOYS TO ASTLEY'S. THE PARTY
WAS TO BE OUR BROTHER AND SISTER, HENRY, JOHN--AND MISS SMITH.
MY FRIEND ROBERT COULD NOT RESIST.  THEY CALLED FOR HIM IN THEIR WAY;
WERE ALL EXTREMELY AMUSED; AND MY BROTHER ASKED HIM TO DINE WITH
THEM THE NEXT DAY--WHICH HE DID--AND IN THE COURSE OF THAT VISIT
(AS I UNDERSTAND) HE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO HARRIET;
AND CERTAINLY DID NOT SPEAK IN VAIN.--SHE MADE HIM, BY HER ACCEPTANCE,
AS HAPPY EVEN AS HE IS DESERVING.  HE CAME DOWN BY YESTERDAY'S COACH,
AND WAS WITH ME THIS MORNING IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST, TO REPORT
HIS PROCEEDINGS, FIRST ON MY AFFAIRS, AND THEN ON HIS OWN.
THIS IS ALL THAT I CAN RELATE OF THE HOW, WHERE, AND WHEN.
YOUR FRIEND HARRIET WILL MAKE A MUCH LONGER HISTORY WHEN YOU SEE HER.--
SHE WILL GIVE YOU ALL THE MINUTE PARTICULARS, WHICH ONLY WOMAN'S
LANGUAGE CAN MAKE INTERESTING.--IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS WE DEAL ONLY
IN THE GREAT.--HOWEVER, I MUST SAY, THAT ROBERT MARTIN'S HEART SEEMED
FOR _HIM_, AND TO _ME_, VERY OVERFLOWING; AND THAT HE DID MENTION,
WITHOUT ITS BEING MUCH TO THE PURPOSE, THAT ON QUITTING THEIR
BOX AT ASTLEY'S, MY BROTHER TOOK CHARGE OF MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY
AND LITTLE JOHN, AND HE FOLLOWED WITH MISS SMITH AND HENRY;
AND THAT AT ONE TIME THEY WERE IN SUCH A CROWD, AS TO MAKE MISS SMITH
RATHER UNEASY."

HE STOPPED.--EMMA DARED NOT ATTEMPT ANY IMMEDIATE REPLY.  TO SPEAK,
SHE WAS SURE WOULD BE TO BETRAY A MOST UNREASONABLE DEGREE
OF HAPPINESS.  SHE MUST WAIT A MOMENT, OR HE WOULD THINK HER MAD.
HER SILENCE DISTURBED HIM; AND AFTER OBSERVING HER A LITTLE WHILE,
HE ADDED,

"EMMA, MY LOVE, YOU SAID THAT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD NOT NOW MAKE
YOU UNHAPPY; BUT I AM AFRAID IT GIVES YOU MORE PAIN THAN YOU EXPECTED.
HIS SITUATION IS AN EVIL--BUT YOU MUST CONSIDER IT AS WHAT SATISFIES
YOUR FRIEND; AND I WILL ANSWER FOR YOUR THINKING BETTER AND BETTER
OF HIM AS YOU KNOW HIM MORE.  HIS GOOD SENSE AND GOOD PRINCIPLES WOULD
DELIGHT YOU.--AS FAR AS THE MAN IS CONCERNED, YOU COULD NOT WISH YOUR
FRIEND IN BETTER HANDS.  HIS RANK IN SOCIETY I WOULD ALTER IF I COULD,
WHICH IS SAYING A GREAT DEAL I ASSURE YOU, EMMA.--YOU LAUGH AT ME
ABOUT WILLIAM LARKINS; BUT I COULD QUITE AS ILL SPARE ROBERT MARTIN."

HE WANTED HER TO LOOK UP AND SMILE; AND HAVING NOW BROUGHT HERSELF
NOT TO SMILE TOO BROADLY--SHE DID--CHEERFULLY ANSWERING,

"YOU NEED NOT BE AT ANY PAINS TO RECONCILE ME TO THE MATCH.  I THINK
HARRIET IS DOING EXTREMELY WELL.  _HER_ CONNEXIONS MAY BE WORSE THAN _HIS_.
IN RESPECTABILITY OF CHARACTER, THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THEY ARE.
I HAVE BEEN SILENT FROM SURPRIZE MERELY, EXCESSIVE SURPRIZE.
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW SUDDENLY IT HAS COME ON ME! HOW PECULIARLY
UNPREPARED I WAS!--FOR I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HER VERY LATELY MORE
DETERMINED AGAINST HIM, MUCH MORE, THAN SHE WAS BEFORE."

"YOU OUGHT TO KNOW YOUR FRIEND BEST," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY;
"BUT I SHOULD SAY SHE WAS A GOOD-TEMPERED, SOFT-HEARTED GIRL,
NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY, VERY DETERMINED AGAINST ANY YOUNG MAN WHO TOLD
HER HE LOVED HER."

EMMA COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AS SHE ANSWERED, "UPON MY WORD,
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW HER QUITE AS WELL AS I DO.--BUT, MR. KNIGHTLEY,
ARE YOU PERFECTLY SURE THAT SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY AND DOWNRIGHT
_ACCEPTED_ HIM.  I COULD SUPPOSE SHE MIGHT IN TIME--BUT CAN SHE ALREADY?--
DID NOT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM?--YOU WERE BOTH TALKING OF OTHER THINGS;
OF BUSINESS, SHOWS OF CATTLE, OR NEW DRILLS--AND MIGHT NOT YOU,
IN THE CONFUSION OF SO MANY SUBJECTS, MISTAKE HIM?--IT WAS NOT
HARRIET'S HAND THAT HE WAS CERTAIN OF--IT WAS THE DIMENSIONS OF SOME
FAMOUS OX."

THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE COUNTENANCE AND AIR OF MR. KNIGHTLEY AND
ROBERT MARTIN WAS, AT THIS MOMENT, SO STRONG TO EMMA'S FEELINGS,
AND SO STRONG WAS THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL THAT HAD SO RECENTLY
PASSED ON HARRIET'S SIDE, SO FRESH THE SOUND OF THOSE WORDS,
SPOKEN WITH SUCH EMPHASIS, "NO, I HOPE I KNOW BETTER THAN TO THINK
OF ROBERT MARTIN," THAT SHE WAS REALLY EXPECTING THE INTELLIGENCE
TO PROVE, IN SOME MEASURE, PREMATURE.  IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE.

"DO YOU DARE SAY THIS?" CRIED MR. KNIGHTLEY.  "DO YOU DARE TO SUPPOSE
ME SO GREAT A BLOCKHEAD, AS NOT TO KNOW WHAT A MAN IS TALKING OF?--
WHAT DO YOU DESERVE?"

"OH!  I ALWAYS DESERVE THE BEST TREATMENT, BECAUSE I NEVER PUT
UP WITH ANY OTHER; AND, THEREFORE, YOU MUST GIVE ME A PLAIN,
DIRECT ANSWER.  ARE YOU QUITE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE TERMS
ON WHICH MR. MARTIN AND HARRIET NOW ARE?"

"I AM QUITE SURE," HE REPLIED, SPEAKING VERY DISTINCTLY, "THAT HE
TOLD ME SHE HAD ACCEPTED HIM; AND THAT THERE WAS NO OBSCURITY,
NOTHING DOUBTFUL, IN THE WORDS HE USED; AND I THINK I CAN GIVE YOU
A PROOF THAT IT MUST BE SO.  HE ASKED MY OPINION AS TO WHAT HE
WAS NOW TO DO.  HE KNEW OF NO ONE BUT MRS. GODDARD TO WHOM HE
COULD APPLY FOR INFORMATION OF HER RELATIONS OR FRIENDS.  COULD I
MENTION ANY THING MORE FIT TO BE DONE, THAN TO GO TO MRS. GODDARD?
I ASSURED HIM THAT I COULD NOT.  THEN, HE SAID, HE WOULD ENDEAVOUR
TO SEE HER IN THE COURSE OF THIS DAY."

"I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED," REPLIED EMMA, WITH THE BRIGHTEST SMILES,
"AND MOST SINCERELY WISH THEM HAPPY."

"YOU ARE MATERIALLY CHANGED SINCE WE TALKED ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE."

"I HOPE SO--FOR AT THAT TIME I WAS A FOOL."

"AND I AM CHANGED ALSO; FOR I AM NOW VERY WILLING TO GRANT YOU ALL
HARRIET'S GOOD QUALITIES.  I HAVE TAKEN SOME PAINS FOR YOUR SAKE,
AND FOR ROBERT MARTIN'S SAKE, (WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS HAD REASON TO BELIEVE
AS MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER AS EVER,) TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH HER.
I HAVE OFTEN TALKED TO HER A GOOD DEAL.  YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THAT
I DID.  SOMETIMES, INDEED, I HAVE THOUGHT YOU WERE HALF SUSPECTING ME
OF PLEADING POOR MARTIN'S CAUSE, WHICH WAS NEVER THE CASE; BUT, FROM ALL
MY OBSERVATIONS, I AM CONVINCED OF HER BEING AN ARTLESS, AMIABLE GIRL,
WITH VERY GOOD NOTIONS, VERY SERIOUSLY GOOD PRINCIPLES, AND PLACING
HER HAPPINESS IN THE AFFECTIONS AND UTILITY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.--
MUCH OF THIS, I HAVE NO DOUBT, SHE MAY THANK YOU FOR."

"ME!" CRIED EMMA, SHAKING HER HEAD.--"AH! POOR HARRIET!"

SHE CHECKED HERSELF, HOWEVER, AND SUBMITTED QUIETLY TO A LITTLE
MORE PRAISE THAN SHE DESERVED.

THEIR CONVERSATION WAS SOON AFTERWARDS CLOSED BY THE ENTRANCE OF
HER FATHER.  SHE WAS NOT SORRY.  SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE.  HER MIND
WAS IN A STATE OF FLUTTER AND WONDER, WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER
TO BE COLLECTED.  SHE WAS IN DANCING, SINGING, EXCLAIMING SPIRITS;
AND TILL SHE HAD MOVED ABOUT, AND TALKED TO HERSELF, AND LAUGHED
AND REFLECTED, SHE COULD BE FIT FOR NOTHING RATIONAL.

HER FATHER'S BUSINESS WAS TO ANNOUNCE JAMES'S BEING GONE OUT TO PUT
THE HORSES TO, PREPARATORY TO THEIR NOW DAILY DRIVE TO RANDALLS;
AND SHE HAD, THEREFORE, AN IMMEDIATE EXCUSE FOR DISAPPEARING.

THE JOY, THE GRATITUDE, THE EXQUISITE DELIGHT OF HER SENSATIONS
MAY BE IMAGINED.  THE SOLE GRIEVANCE AND ALLOY THUS REMOVED IN THE
PROSPECT OF HARRIET'S WELFARE, SHE WAS REALLY IN DANGER OF BECOMING
TOO HAPPY FOR SECURITY.--WHAT HAD SHE TO WISH FOR?  NOTHING, BUT TO
GROW MORE WORTHY OF HIM, WHOSE INTENTIONS AND JUDGMENT HAD BEEN
EVER SO SUPERIOR TO HER OWN.  NOTHING, BUT THAT THE LESSONS
OF HER PAST FOLLY MIGHT TEACH HER HUMILITY AND CIRCUMSPECTION IN FUTURE.

SERIOUS SHE WAS, VERY SERIOUS IN HER THANKFULNESS, AND IN HER RESOLUTIONS;
AND YET THERE WAS NO PREVENTING A LAUGH, SOMETIMES IN THE VERY MIDST
OF THEM.  SHE MUST LAUGH AT SUCH A CLOSE!  SUCH AN END OF THE DOLEFUL
DISAPPOINTMENT OF FIVE WEEKS BACK!  SUCH A HEART--SUCH A HARRIET!

NOW THERE WOULD BE PLEASURE IN HER RETURNING--EVERY THING WOULD
BE A PLEASURE.  IT WOULD BE A GREAT PLEASURE TO KNOW ROBERT MARTIN.

HIGH IN THE RANK OF HER MOST SERIOUS AND HEARTFELT FELICITIES,
WAS THE REFLECTION THAT ALL NECESSITY OF CONCEALMENT FROM
MR. KNIGHTLEY WOULD SOON BE OVER.  THE DISGUISE, EQUIVOCATION,
MYSTERY, SO HATEFUL TO HER TO PRACTISE, MIGHT SOON BE OVER.
SHE COULD NOW LOOK FORWARD TO GIVING HIM THAT FULL AND PERFECT
CONFIDENCE WHICH HER DISPOSITION WAS MOST READY TO WELCOME AS A DUTY.

IN THE GAYEST AND HAPPIEST SPIRITS SHE SET FORWARD WITH HER FATHER;
NOT ALWAYS LISTENING, BUT ALWAYS AGREEING TO WHAT HE SAID;
AND, WHETHER IN SPEECH OR SILENCE, CONNIVING AT THE COMFORTABLE
PERSUASION OF HIS BEING OBLIGED TO GO TO RANDALLS EVERY DAY,
OR POOR MRS. WESTON WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED.

THEY ARRIVED.--MRS. WESTON WAS ALONE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM:--
BUT HARDLY HAD THEY BEEN TOLD OF THE BABY, AND MR. WOODHOUSE
RECEIVED THE THANKS FOR COMING, WHICH HE ASKED FOR, WHEN A GLIMPSE
WAS CAUGHT THROUGH THE BLIND, OF TWO FIGURES PASSING NEAR THE WINDOW.

"IT IS FRANK AND MISS FAIRFAX," SAID MRS. WESTON.  "I WAS JUST
GOING TO TELL YOU OF OUR AGREEABLE SURPRIZE IN SEEING HIM ARRIVE
THIS MORNING.  HE STAYS TILL TO-MORROW, AND MISS FAIRFAX HAS BEEN
PERSUADED TO SPEND THE DAY WITH US.--THEY ARE COMING IN, I HOPE."

IN HALF A MINUTE THEY WERE IN THE ROOM.  EMMA WAS EXTREMELY GLAD
TO SEE HIM--BUT THERE WAS A DEGREE OF CONFUSION--A NUMBER OF
EMBARRASSING RECOLLECTIONS ON EACH SIDE.  THEY MET READILY AND SMILING,
BUT WITH A CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH AT FIRST ALLOWED LITTLE TO BE SAID;
AND HAVING ALL SAT DOWN AGAIN, THERE WAS FOR SOME TIME SUCH A BLANK
IN THE CIRCLE, THAT EMMA BEGAN TO DOUBT WHETHER THE WISH NOW INDULGED,
WHICH SHE HAD LONG FELT, OF SEEING FRANK CHURCHILL ONCE MORE,
AND OF SEEING HIM WITH JANE, WOULD YIELD ITS PROPORTION OF PLEASURE.
WHEN MR. WESTON JOINED THE PARTY, HOWEVER, AND WHEN THE BABY
WAS FETCHED, THERE WAS NO LONGER A WANT OF SUBJECT OR ANIMATION--
OR OF COURAGE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR FRANK CHURCHILL TO DRAW NEAR HER
AND SAY,

"I HAVE TO THANK YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, FOR A VERY KIND FORGIVING
MESSAGE IN ONE OF MRS. WESTON'S LETTERS.  I HOPE TIME HAS NOT MADE
YOU LESS WILLING TO PARDON.  I HOPE YOU DO NOT RETRACT WHAT YOU
THEN SAID."

"NO, INDEED," CRIED EMMA, MOST HAPPY TO BEGIN, "NOT IN THE LEAST.
I AM PARTICULARLY GLAD TO SEE AND SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU--AND TO GIVE
YOU JOY IN PERSON."

HE THANKED HER WITH ALL HIS HEART, AND CONTINUED SOME TIME TO SPEAK
WITH SERIOUS FEELING OF HIS GRATITUDE AND HAPPINESS.

"IS NOT SHE LOOKING WELL?" SAID HE, TURNING HIS EYES TOWARDS JANE.
"BETTER THAN SHE EVER USED TO DO?--YOU SEE HOW MY FATHER AND
MRS. WESTON DOAT UPON HER."

BUT HIS SPIRITS WERE SOON RISING AGAIN, AND WITH LAUGHING EYES,
AFTER MENTIONING THE EXPECTED RETURN OF THE CAMPBELLS, HE NAMED
THE NAME OF DIXON.--EMMA BLUSHED, AND FORBADE ITS BEING PRONOUNCED
IN HER HEARING.

"I CAN NEVER THINK OF IT," SHE CRIED, "WITHOUT EXTREME SHAME."

"THE SHAME," HE ANSWERED, "IS ALL MINE, OR OUGHT TO BE.  BUT IS IT
POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAD NO SUSPICION?--I MEAN OF LATE.  EARLY, I KNOW,
YOU HAD NONE."

"I NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST, I ASSURE YOU."

"THAT APPEARS QUITE WONDERFUL.  I WAS ONCE VERY NEAR--AND I WISH I HAD--
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.  BUT THOUGH I WAS ALWAYS DOING WRONG THINGS,
THEY WERE VERY BAD WRONG THINGS, AND SUCH AS DID ME NO SERVICE.--
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER TRANSGRESSION HAD I BROKEN THE BOND
OF SECRECY AND TOLD YOU EVERY THING."

"IT IS NOT NOW WORTH A REGRET," SAID EMMA.

"I HAVE SOME HOPE," RESUMED HE, "OF MY UNCLE'S BEING PERSUADED
TO PAY A VISIT AT RANDALLS; HE WANTS TO BE INTRODUCED TO HER.
WHEN THE CAMPBELLS ARE RETURNED, WE SHALL MEET THEM IN LONDON,
AND CONTINUE THERE, I TRUST, TILL WE MAY CARRY HER NORTHWARD.--BUT NOW,
I AM AT SUCH A DISTANCE FROM HER--IS NOT IT HARD, MISS WOODHOUSE?--
TILL THIS MORNING, WE HAVE NOT ONCE MET SINCE THE DAY OF RECONCILIATION.
DO NOT YOU PITY ME?"

EMMA SPOKE HER PITY SO VERY KINDLY, THAT WITH A SUDDEN ACCESSION
OF GAY THOUGHT, HE CRIED,

"AH! BY THE BYE," THEN SINKING HIS VOICE, AND LOOKING DEMURE FOR
THE MOMENT--"I HOPE MR. KNIGHTLEY IS WELL?"  HE PAUSED.--SHE COLOURED
AND LAUGHED.--"I KNOW YOU SAW MY LETTER, AND THINK YOU MAY REMEMBER
MY WISH IN YOUR FAVOUR.  LET ME RETURN YOUR CONGRATULATIONS.--
I ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE HEARD THE NEWS WITH THE WARMEST INTEREST
AND SATISFACTION.--HE IS A MAN WHOM I CANNOT PRESUME TO PRAISE."

EMMA WAS DELIGHTED, AND ONLY WANTED HIM TO GO ON IN THE SAME STYLE;
BUT HIS MIND WAS THE NEXT MOMENT IN HIS OWN CONCERNS AND WITH HIS
OWN JANE, AND HIS NEXT WORDS WERE,

"DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A SKIN?--SUCH SMOOTHNESS! SUCH DELICACY!--
AND YET WITHOUT BEING ACTUALLY FAIR.--ONE CANNOT CALL HER FAIR.
IT IS A MOST UNCOMMON COMPLEXION, WITH HER DARK EYE-LASHES AND HAIR--
A MOST DISTINGUISHING COMPLEXION!  SO PECULIARLY THE LADY IN IT.--
JUST COLOUR ENOUGH FOR BEAUTY."

"I HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED HER COMPLEXION," REPLIED EMMA, ARCHLY; "BUT DO NOT
I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN YOU FOUND FAULT WITH HER FOR BEING SO PALE?--
WHEN WE FIRST BEGAN TO TALK OF HER.--HAVE YOU QUITE FORGOTTEN?"

"OH! NO--WHAT AN IMPUDENT DOG I WAS!--HOW COULD I DARE--"

BUT HE LAUGHED SO HEARTILY AT THE RECOLLECTION, THAT EMMA COULD
NOT HELP SAYING,

"I DO SUSPECT THAT IN THE MIDST OF YOUR PERPLEXITIES AT THAT TIME,
YOU HAD VERY GREAT AMUSEMENT IN TRICKING US ALL.--I AM SURE YOU HAD.--
I AM SURE IT WAS A CONSOLATION TO YOU."

"OH! NO, NO, NO--HOW CAN YOU SUSPECT ME OF SUCH A THING?
I WAS THE MOST MISERABLE WRETCH!"

"NOT QUITE SO MISERABLE AS TO BE INSENSIBLE TO MIRTH.  I AM SURE IT
WAS A SOURCE OF HIGH ENTERTAINMENT TO YOU, TO FEEL THAT YOU WERE TAKING
US ALL IN.--PERHAPS I AM THE READIER TO SUSPECT, BECAUSE, TO TELL
YOU THE TRUTH, I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME AMUSEMENT TO MYSELF
IN THE SAME SITUATION.  I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE LIKENESS BETWEEN US."

HE BOWED.

"IF NOT IN OUR DISPOSITIONS," SHE PRESENTLY ADDED, WITH A LOOK OF
TRUE SENSIBILITY, "THERE IS A LIKENESS IN OUR DESTINY; THE DESTINY
WHICH BIDS FAIR TO CONNECT US WITH TWO CHARACTERS SO MUCH SUPERIOR
TO OUR OWN."

"TRUE, TRUE," HE ANSWERED, WARMLY.  "NO, NOT TRUE ON YOUR SIDE.  YOU CAN
HAVE NO SUPERIOR, BUT MOST TRUE ON MINE.--SHE IS A COMPLETE ANGEL.
LOOK AT HER.  IS NOT SHE AN ANGEL IN EVERY GESTURE?  OBSERVE THE TURN
OF HER THROAT.  OBSERVE HER EYES, AS SHE IS LOOKING UP AT MY FATHER.--
YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR (INCLINING HIS HEAD, AND WHISPERING SERIOUSLY)
THAT MY UNCLE MEANS TO GIVE HER ALL MY AUNT'S JEWELS.  THEY ARE TO BE
NEW SET.  I AM RESOLVED TO HAVE SOME IN AN ORNAMENT FOR THE HEAD.
WILL NOT IT BE BEAUTIFUL IN HER DARK HAIR?"

"VERY BEAUTIFUL, INDEED," REPLIED EMMA; AND SHE SPOKE SO KINDLY,
THAT HE GRATEFULLY BURST OUT,

"HOW DELIGHTED I AM TO SEE YOU AGAIN! AND TO SEE YOU IN SUCH
EXCELLENT LOOKS!--I WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED THIS MEETING FOR THE WORLD.
I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE CALLED AT HARTFIELD, HAD YOU FAILED TO COME."

THE OTHERS HAD BEEN TALKING OF THE CHILD, MRS. WESTON GIVING AN
ACCOUNT OF A LITTLE ALARM SHE HAD BEEN UNDER, THE EVENING BEFORE,
FROM THE INFANT'S APPEARING NOT QUITE WELL.  SHE BELIEVED SHE HAD
BEEN FOOLISH, BUT IT HAD ALARMED HER, AND SHE HAD BEEN WITHIN HALF
A MINUTE OF SENDING FOR MR. PERRY.  PERHAPS SHE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED,
BUT MR. WESTON HAD BEEN ALMOST AS UNEASY AS HERSELF.--IN TEN MINUTES,
HOWEVER, THE CHILD HAD BEEN PERFECTLY WELL AGAIN.  THIS WAS
HER HISTORY; AND PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IT WAS TO MR. WOODHOUSE,
WHO COMMENDED HER VERY MUCH FOR THINKING OF SENDING FOR PERRY,
AND ONLY REGRETTED THAT SHE HAD NOT DONE IT.  "SHE SHOULD ALWAYS SEND
FOR PERRY, IF THE CHILD APPEARED IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE DISORDERED,
WERE IT ONLY FOR A MOMENT.  SHE COULD NOT BE TOO SOON ALARMED,
NOR SEND FOR PERRY TOO OFTEN.  IT WAS A PITY, PERHAPS, THAT HE
HAD NOT COME LAST NIGHT; FOR, THOUGH THE CHILD SEEMED WELL NOW,
VERY WELL CONSIDERING, IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN BETTER IF PERRY
HAD SEEN IT."

FRANK CHURCHILL CAUGHT THE NAME.

"PERRY!" SAID HE TO EMMA, AND TRYING, AS HE SPOKE, TO CATCH MISS
FAIRFAX'S EYE.  "MY FRIEND MR. PERRY!  WHAT ARE THEY SAYING
ABOUT MR. PERRY?--HAS HE BEEN HERE THIS MORNING?--AND HOW DOES
HE TRAVEL NOW?--HAS HE SET UP HIS CARRIAGE?"

EMMA SOON RECOLLECTED, AND UNDERSTOOD HIM; AND WHILE SHE JOINED
IN THE LAUGH, IT WAS EVIDENT FROM JANE'S COUNTENANCE THAT SHE
TOO WAS REALLY HEARING HIM, THOUGH TRYING TO SEEM DEAF.

"SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY DREAM OF MINE!" HE CRIED.  "I CAN NEVER THINK
OF IT WITHOUT LAUGHING.--SHE HEARS US, SHE HEARS US, MISS WOODHOUSE.
I SEE IT IN HER CHEEK, HER SMILE, HER VAIN ATTEMPT TO FROWN.
LOOK AT HER.  DO NOT YOU SEE THAT, AT THIS INSTANT, THE VERY PASSAGE
OF HER OWN LETTER, WHICH SENT ME THE REPORT, IS PASSING UNDER HER EYE--
THAT THE WHOLE BLUNDER IS SPREAD BEFORE HER--THAT SHE CAN ATTEND TO
NOTHING ELSE, THOUGH PRETENDING TO LISTEN TO THE OTHERS?"

JANE WAS FORCED TO SMILE COMPLETELY, FOR A MOMENT; AND THE SMILE
PARTLY REMAINED AS SHE TURNED TOWARDS HIM, AND SAID IN A CONSCIOUS,
LOW, YET STEADY VOICE,

"HOW YOU CAN BEAR SUCH RECOLLECTIONS, IS ASTONISHING TO ME!--
THEY _WILL_ SOMETIMES OBTRUDE--BUT HOW YOU CAN COURT THEM!"

HE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO SAY IN RETURN, AND VERY ENTERTAININGLY;
BUT EMMA'S FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY WITH JANE, IN THE ARGUMENT; AND ON
LEAVING RANDALLS, AND FALLING NATURALLY INTO A COMPARISON OF THE TWO MEN,
SHE FELT, THAT PLEASED AS SHE HAD BEEN TO SEE FRANK CHURCHILL,
AND REALLY REGARDING HIM AS SHE DID WITH FRIENDSHIP, SHE HAD NEVER
BEEN MORE SENSIBLE OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S HIGH SUPERIORITY OF CHARACTER.
THE HAPPINESS OF THIS MOST HAPPY DAY, RECEIVED ITS COMPLETION, IN THE
ANIMATED CONTEMPLATION OF HIS WORTH WHICH THIS COMPARISON PRODUCED.



CHAPTER XIX


IF EMMA HAD STILL, AT INTERVALS, AN ANXIOUS FEELING FOR HARRIET,
A MOMENTARY DOUBT OF ITS BEING POSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE REALLY CURED
OF HER ATTACHMENT TO MR. KNIGHTLEY, AND REALLY ABLE TO ACCEPT
ANOTHER MAN FROM UNBIASED INCLINATION, IT WAS NOT LONG THAT SHE
HAD TO SUFFER FROM THE RECURRENCE OF ANY SUCH UNCERTAINTY.
A VERY FEW DAYS BROUGHT THE PARTY FROM LONDON, AND SHE HAD NO
SOONER AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING ONE HOUR ALONE WITH HARRIET,
THAN SHE BECAME PERFECTLY SATISFIED--UNACCOUNTABLE AS IT WAS!--
THAT ROBERT MARTIN HAD THOROUGHLY SUPPLANTED MR. KNIGHTLEY,
AND WAS NOW FORMING ALL HER VIEWS OF HAPPINESS.

HARRIET WAS A LITTLE DISTRESSED--DID LOOK A LITTLE FOOLISH AT FIRST:
BUT HAVING ONCE OWNED THAT SHE HAD BEEN PRESUMPTUOUS AND SILLY,
AND SELF-DECEIVED, BEFORE, HER PAIN AND CONFUSION SEEMED TO DIE
AWAY WITH THE WORDS, AND LEAVE HER WITHOUT A CARE FOR THE PAST,
AND WITH THE FULLEST EXULTATION IN THE PRESENT AND FUTURE; FOR, AS TO
HER FRIEND'S APPROBATION, EMMA HAD INSTANTLY REMOVED EVERY FEAR OF
THAT NATURE, BY MEETING HER WITH THE MOST UNQUALIFIED CONGRATULATIONS.--
HARRIET WAS MOST HAPPY TO GIVE EVERY PARTICULAR OF THE EVENING AT
ASTLEY'S, AND THE DINNER THE NEXT DAY; SHE COULD DWELL ON IT ALL
WITH THE UTMOST DELIGHT.  BUT WHAT DID SUCH PARTICULARS EXPLAIN?--
THE FACT WAS, AS EMMA COULD NOW ACKNOWLEDGE, THAT HARRIET HAD
ALWAYS LIKED ROBERT MARTIN; AND THAT HIS CONTINUING TO LOVE HER HAD
BEEN IRRESISTIBLE.--BEYOND THIS, IT MUST EVER BE UNINTELLIGIBLE
TO EMMA.

THE EVENT, HOWEVER, WAS MOST JOYFUL; AND EVERY DAY WAS GIVING HER
FRESH REASON FOR THINKING SO.--HARRIET'S PARENTAGE BECAME KNOWN.
SHE PROVED TO BE THE DAUGHTER OF A TRADESMAN, RICH ENOUGH TO AFFORD
HER THE COMFORTABLE MAINTENANCE WHICH HAD EVER BEEN HERS, AND DECENT
ENOUGH TO HAVE ALWAYS WISHED FOR CONCEALMENT.--SUCH WAS THE BLOOD
OF GENTILITY WHICH EMMA HAD FORMERLY BEEN SO READY TO VOUCH FOR!--
IT WAS LIKELY TO BE AS UNTAINTED, PERHAPS, AS THE BLOOD OF MANY
A GENTLEMAN:  BUT WHAT A CONNEXION HAD SHE BEEN PREPARING FOR
MR. KNIGHTLEY--OR FOR THE CHURCHILLS--OR EVEN FOR MR. ELTON!--
THE STAIN OF ILLEGITIMACY, UNBLEACHED BY NOBILITY OR WEALTH,
WOULD HAVE BEEN A STAIN INDEED.

NO OBJECTION WAS RAISED ON THE FATHER'S SIDE; THE YOUNG MAN WAS
TREATED LIBERALLY; IT WAS ALL AS IT SHOULD BE:  AND AS EMMA BECAME
ACQUAINTED WITH ROBERT MARTIN, WHO WAS NOW INTRODUCED AT HARTFIELD,
SHE FULLY ACKNOWLEDGED IN HIM ALL THE APPEARANCE OF SENSE AND WORTH
WHICH COULD BID FAIREST FOR HER LITTLE FRIEND.  SHE HAD NO DOUBT
OF HARRIET'S HAPPINESS WITH ANY GOOD-TEMPERED MAN; BUT WITH HIM,
AND IN THE HOME HE OFFERED, THERE WOULD BE THE HOPE OF MORE,
OF SECURITY, STABILITY, AND IMPROVEMENT.  SHE WOULD BE PLACED IN THE
MIDST OF THOSE WHO LOVED HER, AND WHO HAD BETTER SENSE THAN HERSELF;
RETIRED ENOUGH FOR SAFETY, AND OCCUPIED ENOUGH FOR CHEERFULNESS.
SHE WOULD BE NEVER LED INTO TEMPTATION, NOR LEFT FOR IT TO FIND HER OUT.
SHE WOULD BE RESPECTABLE AND HAPPY; AND EMMA ADMITTED HER TO BE
THE LUCKIEST CREATURE IN THE WORLD, TO HAVE CREATED SO STEADY AND
PERSEVERING AN AFFECTION IN SUCH A MAN;--OR, IF NOT QUITE THE LUCKIEST,
TO YIELD ONLY TO HERSELF.

HARRIET, NECESSARILY DRAWN AWAY BY HER ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE MARTINS,
WAS LESS AND LESS AT HARTFIELD; WHICH WAS NOT TO BE REGRETTED.--
THE INTIMACY BETWEEN HER AND EMMA MUST SINK; THEIR FRIENDSHIP MUST
CHANGE INTO A CALMER SORT OF GOODWILL; AND, FORTUNATELY, WHAT OUGHT
TO BE, AND MUST BE, SEEMED ALREADY BEGINNING, AND IN THE MOST GRADUAL,
NATURAL MANNER.

BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER, EMMA ATTENDED HARRIET TO CHURCH, AND SAW
HER HAND BESTOWED ON ROBERT MARTIN WITH SO COMPLETE A SATISFACTION,
AS NO REMEMBRANCES, EVEN CONNECTED WITH MR. ELTON AS HE STOOD
BEFORE THEM, COULD IMPAIR.--PERHAPS, INDEED, AT THAT TIME SHE
SCARCELY SAW MR. ELTON, BUT AS THE CLERGYMAN WHOSE BLESSING AT THE
ALTAR MIGHT NEXT FALL ON HERSELF.--ROBERT MARTIN AND HARRIET SMITH,
THE LATEST COUPLE ENGAGED OF THE THREE, WERE THE FIRST TO BE MARRIED.

JANE FAIRFAX HAD ALREADY QUITTED HIGHBURY, AND WAS RESTORED TO THE
COMFORTS OF HER BELOVED HOME WITH THE CAMPBELLS.--THE MR. CHURCHILLS
WERE ALSO IN TOWN; AND THEY WERE ONLY WAITING FOR NOVEMBER.

THE INTERMEDIATE MONTH WAS THE ONE FIXED ON, AS FAR AS THEY DARED,
BY EMMA AND MR. KNIGHTLEY.--THEY HAD DETERMINED THAT THEIR MARRIAGE
OUGHT TO BE CONCLUDED WHILE JOHN AND ISABELLA WERE STILL AT HARTFIELD,
TO ALLOW THEM THE FORTNIGHT'S ABSENCE IN A TOUR TO THE SEASIDE,
WHICH WAS THE PLAN.--JOHN AND ISABELLA, AND EVERY OTHER FRIEND,
WERE AGREED IN APPROVING IT.  BUT MR. WOODHOUSE--HOW WAS MR. WOODHOUSE
TO BE INDUCED TO CONSENT?--HE, WHO HAD NEVER YET ALLUDED TO THEIR
MARRIAGE BUT AS A DISTANT EVENT.

WHEN FIRST SOUNDED ON THE SUBJECT, HE WAS SO MISERABLE, THAT THEY
WERE ALMOST HOPELESS.--A SECOND ALLUSION, INDEED, GAVE LESS PAIN.--
HE BEGAN TO THINK IT WAS TO BE, AND THAT HE COULD NOT PREVENT IT--
A VERY PROMISING STEP OF THE MIND ON ITS WAY TO RESIGNATION.
STILL, HOWEVER, HE WAS NOT HAPPY.  NAY, HE APPEARED SO MUCH OTHERWISE,
THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S COURAGE FAILED.  SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE
HIM SUFFERING, TO KNOW HIM FANCYING HIMSELF NEGLECTED; AND THOUGH
HER UNDERSTANDING ALMOST ACQUIESCED IN THE ASSURANCE OF BOTH THE
MR. KNIGHTLEYS, THAT WHEN ONCE THE EVENT WERE OVER, HIS DISTRESS
WOULD BE SOON OVER TOO, SHE HESITATED--SHE COULD NOT PROCEED.

IN THIS STATE OF SUSPENSE THEY WERE BEFRIENDED, NOT BY ANY SUDDEN
ILLUMINATION OF MR. WOODHOUSE'S MIND, OR ANY WONDERFUL CHANGE OF HIS
NERVOUS SYSTEM, BUT BY THE OPERATION OF THE SAME SYSTEM IN ANOTHER WAY.--
MRS. WESTON'S POULTRY-HOUSE WAS ROBBED ONE NIGHT OF ALL HER TURKEYS--
EVIDENTLY BY THE INGENUITY OF MAN.  OTHER POULTRY-YARDS IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD ALSO SUFFERED.--PILFERING WAS _HOUSEBREAKING_ TO
MR. WOODHOUSE'S FEARS.--HE WAS VERY UNEASY; AND BUT FOR THE SENSE
OF HIS SON-IN-LAW'S PROTECTION, WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER WRETCHED ALARM
EVERY NIGHT OF HIS LIFE.  THE STRENGTH, RESOLUTION, AND PRESENCE
OF MIND OF THE MR. KNIGHTLEYS, COMMANDED HIS FULLEST DEPENDENCE.
WHILE EITHER OF THEM PROTECTED HIM AND HIS, HARTFIELD WAS SAFE.--
BUT MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY MUST BE IN LONDON AGAIN BY THE END OF THE
FIRST WEEK IN NOVEMBER.

THE RESULT OF THIS DISTRESS WAS, THAT, WITH A MUCH MORE VOLUNTARY,
CHEERFUL CONSENT THAN HIS DAUGHTER HAD EVER PRESUMED TO HOPE FOR AT
THE MOMENT, SHE WAS ABLE TO FIX HER WEDDING-DAY--AND MR. ELTON WAS
CALLED ON, WITHIN A MONTH FROM THE MARRIAGE OF MR. AND MRS. ROBERT
MARTIN, TO JOIN THE HANDS OF MR. KNIGHTLEY AND MISS WOODHOUSE.

THE WEDDING WAS VERY MUCH LIKE OTHER WEDDINGS, WHERE THE PARTIES
HAVE NO TASTE FOR FINERY OR PARADE; AND MRS. ELTON, FROM THE
PARTICULARS DETAILED BY HER HUSBAND, THOUGHT IT ALL EXTREMELY SHABBY,
AND VERY INFERIOR TO HER OWN.--"VERY LITTLE WHITE SATIN, VERY FEW
LACE VEILS; A MOST PITIFUL BUSINESS!--SELINA WOULD STARE WHEN SHE
HEARD OF IT."--BUT, IN SPITE OF THESE DEFICIENCIES, THE WISHES,
THE HOPES, THE CONFIDENCE, THE PREDICTIONS OF THE SMALL BAND
OF TRUE FRIENDS WHO WITNESSED THE CEREMONY, WERE FULLY ANSWERED
IN THE PERFECT HAPPINESS OF THE UNION.

[PERSUASION BY JANE AUSTEN 1818]


CHAPTER 1


SIR WALTER ELLIOT, OF KELLYNCH HALL, IN SOMERSETSHIRE, WAS A MAN WHO,
FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT, NEVER TOOK UP ANY BOOK BUT THE BARONETAGE;
THERE HE FOUND OCCUPATION FOR AN IDLE HOUR, AND CONSOLATION IN A
DISTRESSED ONE; THERE HIS FACULTIES WERE ROUSED INTO ADMIRATION AND
RESPECT, BY CONTEMPLATING THE LIMITED REMNANT OF THE EARLIEST PATENTS;
THERE ANY UNWELCOME SENSATIONS, ARISING FROM DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
CHANGED NATURALLY INTO PITY AND CONTEMPT AS HE TURNED OVER
THE ALMOST ENDLESS CREATIONS OF THE LAST CENTURY; AND THERE,
IF EVERY OTHER LEAF WERE POWERLESS, HE COULD READ HIS OWN HISTORY
WITH AN INTEREST WHICH NEVER FAILED.  THIS WAS THE PAGE AT WHICH
THE FAVOURITE VOLUME ALWAYS OPENED:

           "ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.

"WALTER ELLIOT, BORN MARCH 1, 1760, MARRIED, JULY 15, 1784, ELIZABETH,
DAUGHTER OF JAMES STEVENSON, ESQ. OF SOUTH PARK, IN THE COUNTY OF
GLOUCESTER, BY WHICH LADY (WHO DIED 1800) HE HAS ISSUE ELIZABETH,
BORN JUNE 1, 1785; ANNE, BORN AUGUST 9, 1787; A STILL-BORN SON,
NOVEMBER 5, 1789; MARY, BORN NOVEMBER 20, 1791."

PRECISELY SUCH HAD THE PARAGRAPH ORIGINALLY STOOD FROM THE PRINTER'S HANDS;
BUT SIR WALTER HAD IMPROVED IT BY ADDING, FOR THE INFORMATION OF
HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY, THESE WORDS, AFTER THE DATE OF MARY'S BIRTH--
"MARRIED, DECEMBER 16, 1810, CHARLES, SON AND HEIR OF CHARLES
MUSGROVE, ESQ. OF UPPERCROSS, IN THE COUNTY OF SOMERSET,"
AND BY INSERTING MOST ACCURATELY THE DAY OF THE MONTH ON WHICH
HE HAD LOST HIS WIFE.

THEN FOLLOWED THE HISTORY AND RISE OF THE ANCIENT AND RESPECTABLE FAMILY,
IN THE USUAL TERMS; HOW IT HAD BEEN FIRST SETTLED IN CHESHIRE;
HOW MENTIONED IN DUGDALE, SERVING THE OFFICE OF HIGH SHERIFF,
REPRESENTING A BOROUGH IN THREE SUCCESSIVE PARLIAMENTS,
EXERTIONS OF LOYALTY, AND DIGNITY OF BARONET, IN THE FIRST YEAR
OF CHARLES II, WITH ALL THE MARYS AND ELIZABETHS THEY HAD MARRIED;
FORMING ALTOGETHER TWO HANDSOME DUODECIMO PAGES, AND CONCLUDING WITH
THE ARMS AND MOTTO:--"PRINCIPAL SEAT, KELLYNCH HALL, IN THE COUNTY
OF SOMERSET," AND SIR WALTER'S HANDWRITING AGAIN IN THIS FINALE:--

"HEIR PRESUMPTIVE, WILLIAM WALTER ELLIOT, ESQ., GREAT GRANDSON OF
THE SECOND SIR WALTER."

VANITY WAS THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT'S CHARACTER;
VANITY OF PERSON AND OF SITUATION.  HE HAD BEEN REMARKABLY HANDSOME
IN HIS YOUTH; AND, AT FIFTY-FOUR, WAS STILL A VERY FINE MAN.
FEW WOMEN COULD THINK MORE OF THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAN HE DID,
NOR COULD THE VALET OF ANY NEW MADE LORD BE MORE DELIGHTED WITH
THE PLACE HE HELD IN SOCIETY.  HE CONSIDERED THE BLESSING OF BEAUTY
AS INFERIOR ONLY TO THE BLESSING OF A BARONETCY; AND THE SIR WALTER ELLIOT,
WHO UNITED THESE GIFTS, WAS THE CONSTANT OBJECT OF HIS WARMEST RESPECT
AND DEVOTION.

HIS GOOD LOOKS AND HIS RANK HAD ONE FAIR CLAIM ON HIS ATTACHMENT;
SINCE TO THEM HE MUST HAVE OWED A WIFE OF VERY SUPERIOR CHARACTER
TO ANY THING DESERVED BY HIS OWN.  LADY ELLIOT HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT WOMAN,
SENSIBLE AND AMIABLE; WHOSE JUDGEMENT AND CONDUCT, IF THEY MIGHT BE
PARDONED THE YOUTHFUL INFATUATION WHICH MADE HER LADY ELLIOT,
HAD NEVER REQUIRED INDULGENCE AFTERWARDS.--SHE HAD HUMOURED,
OR SOFTENED, OR CONCEALED HIS FAILINGS, AND PROMOTED HIS REAL
RESPECTABILITY FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS; AND THOUGH NOT THE VERY HAPPIEST
BEING IN THE WORLD HERSELF, HAD FOUND ENOUGH IN HER DUTIES, HER FRIENDS,
AND HER CHILDREN, TO ATTACH HER TO LIFE, AND MAKE IT NO MATTER OF
INDIFFERENCE TO HER WHEN SHE WAS CALLED ON TO QUIT THEM.
--THREE GIRLS, THE TWO ELDEST SIXTEEN AND FOURTEEN, WAS AN AWFUL LEGACY
FOR A MOTHER TO BEQUEATH, AN AWFUL CHARGE RATHER, TO CONFIDE TO
THE AUTHORITY AND GUIDANCE OF A CONCEITED, SILLY FATHER.
SHE HAD, HOWEVER, ONE VERY INTIMATE FRIEND, A SENSIBLE, DESERVING WOMAN,
WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT, BY STRONG ATTACHMENT TO HERSELF, TO SETTLE
CLOSE BY HER, IN THE VILLAGE OF KELLYNCH; AND ON HER KINDNESS AND ADVICE,
LADY ELLIOT MAINLY RELIED FOR THE BEST HELP AND MAINTENANCE OF
THE GOOD PRINCIPLES AND INSTRUCTION WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ANXIOUSLY
GIVING HER DAUGHTERS.

THIS FRIEND, AND SIR WALTER, DID NOT MARRY, WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN
ANTICIPATED ON THAT HEAD BY THEIR ACQUAINTANCE.  THIRTEEN YEARS
HAD PASSED AWAY SINCE LADY ELLIOT'S DEATH, AND THEY WERE STILL
NEAR NEIGHBOURS AND INTIMATE FRIENDS, AND ONE REMAINED A WIDOWER,
THE OTHER A WIDOW.

THAT LADY RUSSELL, OF STEADY AGE AND CHARACTER, AND EXTREMELY
WELL PROVIDED FOR, SHOULD HAVE NO THOUGHT OF A SECOND MARRIAGE,
NEEDS NO APOLOGY TO THE PUBLIC, WHICH IS RATHER APT TO BE UNREASONABLY
DISCONTENTED WHEN A WOMAN DOES MARRY AGAIN, THAN WHEN SHE DOES NOT;
BUT SIR WALTER'S CONTINUING IN SINGLENESS REQUIRES EXPLANATION.
BE IT KNOWN THEN, THAT SIR WALTER, LIKE A GOOD FATHER, (HAVING MET WITH
ONE OR TWO PRIVATE DISAPPOINTMENTS IN VERY UNREASONABLE APPLICATIONS),
PRIDED HIMSELF ON REMAINING SINGLE FOR HIS DEAR DAUGHTERS' SAKE.
FOR ONE DAUGHTER, HIS ELDEST, HE WOULD REALLY HAVE GIVEN UP ANY THING,
WHICH HE HAD NOT BEEN VERY MUCH TEMPTED TO DO.  ELIZABETH HAD SUCCEEDED,
AT SIXTEEN, TO ALL THAT WAS POSSIBLE, OF HER MOTHER'S RIGHTS
AND CONSEQUENCE; AND BEING VERY HANDSOME, AND VERY LIKE HIMSELF,
HER INFLUENCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN GREAT, AND THEY HAD GONE ON TOGETHER
MOST HAPPILY.  HIS TWO OTHER CHILDREN WERE OF VERY INFERIOR VALUE.
MARY HAD ACQUIRED A LITTLE ARTIFICIAL IMPORTANCE, BY BECOMING
MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE; BUT ANNE, WITH AN ELEGANCE OF MIND AND SWEETNESS
OF CHARACTER, WHICH MUST HAVE PLACED HER HIGH WITH ANY PEOPLE
OF REAL UNDERSTANDING, WAS NOBODY WITH EITHER FATHER OR SISTER;
HER WORD HAD NO WEIGHT, HER CONVENIENCE WAS ALWAYS TO GIVE WAY--
SHE WAS ONLY ANNE.

TO LADY RUSSELL, INDEED, SHE WAS A MOST DEAR AND HIGHLY VALUED
GOD-DAUGHTER, FAVOURITE, AND FRIEND.  LADY RUSSELL LOVED THEM ALL;
BUT IT WAS ONLY IN ANNE THAT SHE COULD FANCY THE MOTHER TO REVIVE AGAIN.

A FEW YEARS BEFORE, ANNE ELLIOT HAD BEEN A VERY PRETTY GIRL,
BUT HER BLOOM HAD VANISHED EARLY; AND AS EVEN IN ITS HEIGHT,
HER FATHER HAD FOUND LITTLE TO ADMIRE IN HER, (SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT
WERE HER DELICATE FEATURES AND MILD DARK EYES FROM HIS OWN),
THERE COULD BE NOTHING IN THEM, NOW THAT SHE WAS FADED AND THIN,
TO EXCITE HIS ESTEEM. HE HAD NEVER INDULGED MUCH HOPE, HE HAD NOW NONE,
OF EVER READING HER NAME IN ANY OTHER PAGE OF HIS FAVOURITE WORK.
ALL EQUALITY OF ALLIANCE MUST REST WITH ELIZABETH, FOR MARY HAD MERELY
CONNECTED HERSELF WITH AN OLD COUNTRY FAMILY OF RESPECTABILITY AND
LARGE FORTUNE, AND HAD THEREFORE GIVEN ALL THE HONOUR AND RECEIVED NONE:
ELIZABETH WOULD, ONE DAY OR OTHER, MARRY SUITABLY.

IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT A WOMAN IS HANDSOMER AT TWENTY-NINE THAN
SHE WAS TEN YEARS BEFORE; AND, GENERALLY SPEAKING, IF THERE HAS BEEN
NEITHER ILL HEALTH NOR ANXIETY, IT IS A TIME OF LIFE AT WHICH SCARCELY ANY
CHARM IS LOST.  IT WAS SO WITH ELIZABETH, STILL THE SAME HANDSOME
MISS ELLIOT THAT SHE HAD BEGUN TO BE THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, AND SIR WALTER
MIGHT BE EXCUSED, THEREFORE, IN FORGETTING HER AGE, OR, AT LEAST,
BE DEEMED ONLY HALF A FOOL, FOR THINKING HIMSELF AND ELIZABETH
AS BLOOMING AS EVER, AMIDST THE WRECK OF THE GOOD LOOKS OF EVERYBODY ELSE;
FOR HE COULD PLAINLY SEE HOW OLD ALL THE REST OF HIS FAMILY AND
ACQUAINTANCE WERE GROWING.  ANNE HAGGARD, MARY COARSE, EVERY FACE
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WORSTING, AND THE RAPID INCREASE OF THE CROW'S FOOT
ABOUT LADY RUSSELL'S TEMPLES HAD LONG BEEN A DISTRESS TO HIM.

ELIZABETH DID NOT QUITE EQUAL HER FATHER IN PERSONAL CONTENTMENT.
THIRTEEN YEARS HAD SEEN HER MISTRESS OF KELLYNCH HALL, PRESIDING AND
DIRECTING WITH A SELF-POSSESSION AND DECISION WHICH COULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN
THE IDEA OF HER BEING YOUNGER THAN SHE WAS.  FOR THIRTEEN YEARS HAD
SHE BEEN DOING THE HONOURS, AND LAYING DOWN THE DOMESTIC LAW AT HOME,
AND LEADING THE WAY TO THE CHAISE AND FOUR, AND WALKING IMMEDIATELY AFTER
LADY RUSSELL OUT OF ALL THE DRAWING-ROOMS AND DINING-ROOMS IN THE COUNTRY.
THIRTEEN WINTERS' REVOLVING FROSTS HAD SEEN HER OPENING EVERY BALL
OF CREDIT WHICH A SCANTY NEIGHBOURHOOD AFFORDED, AND THIRTEEN SPRINGS
SHEWN THEIR BLOSSOMS, AS SHE TRAVELLED UP TO LONDON WITH HER FATHER,
FOR A FEW WEEKS' ANNUAL ENJOYMENT OF THE GREAT WORLD.  SHE HAD
THE REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THIS, SHE HAD THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING
NINE-AND-TWENTY TO GIVE HER SOME REGRETS AND SOME APPREHENSIONS;
SHE WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF BEING STILL QUITE AS HANDSOME AS EVER,
BUT SHE FELT HER APPROACH TO THE YEARS OF DANGER, AND WOULD HAVE REJOICED
TO BE CERTAIN OF BEING PROPERLY SOLICITED BY BARONET-BLOOD WITHIN
THE NEXT TWELVEMONTH OR TWO.  THEN MIGHT SHE AGAIN TAKE UP
THE BOOK OF BOOKS WITH AS MUCH ENJOYMENT AS IN HER EARLY YOUTH,
BUT NOW SHE LIKED IT NOT.  ALWAYS TO BE PRESENTED WITH THE DATE OF
HER OWN BIRTH AND SEE NO MARRIAGE FOLLOW BUT THAT OF A YOUNGEST SISTER,
MADE THE BOOK AN EVIL; AND MORE THAN ONCE, WHEN HER FATHER HAD LEFT IT
OPEN ON THE TABLE NEAR HER, HAD SHE CLOSED IT, WITH AVERTED EYES,
AND PUSHED IT AWAY.

SHE HAD HAD A DISAPPOINTMENT, MOREOVER, WHICH THAT BOOK,
AND ESPECIALLY THE HISTORY OF HER OWN FAMILY, MUST EVER PRESENT
THE REMEMBRANCE OF.  THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE, THE VERY WILLIAM WALTER
ELLIOT, ESQ., WHOSE RIGHTS HAD BEEN SO GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED
BY HER FATHER, HAD DISAPPOINTED HER.

SHE HAD, WHILE A VERY YOUNG GIRL, AS SOON AS SHE HAD KNOWN HIM TO BE,
IN THE EVENT OF HER HAVING NO BROTHER, THE FUTURE BARONET,
MEANT TO MARRY HIM, AND HER FATHER HAD ALWAYS MEANT THAT SHE SHOULD.
HE HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN TO THEM AS A BOY; BUT SOON AFTER LADY ELLIOT'S DEATH,
SIR WALTER HAD SOUGHT THE ACQUAINTANCE, AND THOUGH HIS OVERTURES
HAD NOT BEEN MET WITH ANY WARMTH, HE HAD PERSEVERED IN SEEKING IT,
MAKING ALLOWANCE FOR THE MODEST DRAWING-BACK OF YOUTH; AND, IN ONE OF
THEIR SPRING EXCURSIONS TO LONDON, WHEN ELIZABETH WAS IN HER FIRST BLOOM,
MR ELLIOT HAD BEEN FORCED INTO THE INTRODUCTION.

HE WAS AT THAT TIME A VERY YOUNG MAN, JUST ENGAGED IN THE STUDY OF THE LAW;
AND ELIZABETH FOUND HIM EXTREMELY AGREEABLE, AND EVERY PLAN IN HIS FAVOUR
WAS CONFIRMED.  HE WAS INVITED TO KELLYNCH HALL; HE WAS TALKED OF
AND EXPECTED ALL THE REST OF THE YEAR; BUT HE NEVER CAME.
THE FOLLOWING SPRING HE WAS SEEN AGAIN IN TOWN, FOUND EQUALLY AGREEABLE,
AGAIN ENCOURAGED, INVITED, AND EXPECTED, AND AGAIN HE DID NOT COME;
AND THE NEXT TIDINGS WERE THAT HE WAS MARRIED.  INSTEAD OF PUSHING
HIS FORTUNE IN THE LINE MARKED OUT FOR THE HEIR OF THE HOUSE OF ELLIOT,
HE HAD PURCHASED INDEPENDENCE BY UNITING HIMSELF TO A RICH WOMAN
OF INFERIOR BIRTH.

SIR WALTER HAS RESENTED IT.  AS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE, HE FELT THAT
HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CONSULTED, ESPECIALLY AFTER TAKING THE YOUNG MAN
SO PUBLICLY BY THE HAND; "FOR THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN TOGETHER,"
HE OBSERVED, "ONCE AT TATTERSALL'S, AND TWICE IN THE LOBBY OF
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS."  HIS DISAPPROBATION WAS EXPRESSED,
BUT APPARENTLY VERY LITTLE REGARDED.  MR ELLIOT HAD ATTEMPTED NO APOLOGY,
AND SHEWN HIMSELF AS UNSOLICITOUS OF BEING LONGER NOTICED BY THE FAMILY,
AS SIR WALTER CONSIDERED HIM UNWORTHY OF IT:  ALL ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN
THEM HAD CEASED.

THIS VERY AWKWARD HISTORY OF MR ELLIOT WAS STILL, AFTER AN INTERVAL
OF SEVERAL YEARS, FELT WITH ANGER BY ELIZABETH, WHO HAD LIKED THE MAN
FOR HIMSELF, AND STILL MORE FOR BEING HER FATHER'S HEIR, AND WHOSE
STRONG FAMILY PRIDE COULD SEE ONLY IN HIM A PROPER MATCH FOR SIR WALTER
ELLIOT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER.  THERE WAS NOT A BARONET FROM A TO Z WHOM
HER FEELINGS COULD HAVE SO WILLINGLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN EQUAL.
YET SO MISERABLY HAD HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF, THAT THOUGH SHE WAS
AT THIS PRESENT TIME (THE SUMMER OF 1814) WEARING BLACK RIBBONS
FOR HIS WIFE, SHE COULD NOT ADMIT HIM TO BE WORTH THINKING OF AGAIN.
THE DISGRACE OF HIS FIRST MARRIAGE MIGHT, PERHAPS, AS THERE WAS
NO REASON TO SUPPOSE IT PERPETUATED BY OFFSPRING, HAVE BEEN GOT OVER,
HAD HE NOT DONE WORSE; BUT HE HAD, AS BY THE ACCUSTOMARY INTERVENTION
OF KIND FRIENDS, THEY HAD BEEN INFORMED, SPOKEN MOST DISRESPECTFULLY
OF THEM ALL, MOST SLIGHTINGLY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY OF THE VERY BLOOD
HE BELONGED TO, AND THE HONOURS WHICH WERE HEREAFTER TO BE HIS OWN.
THIS COULD NOT BE PARDONED.

SUCH WERE ELIZABETH ELLIOT'S SENTIMENTS AND SENSATIONS; SUCH THE CARES
TO ALLOY, THE AGITATIONS TO VARY, THE SAMENESS AND THE ELEGANCE,
THE PROSPERITY AND THE NOTHINGNESS OF HER SCENE OF LIFE;
SUCH THE FEELINGS TO GIVE INTEREST TO A LONG, UNEVENTFUL RESIDENCE
IN ONE COUNTRY CIRCLE, TO FILL THE VACANCIES WHICH THERE WERE NO HABITS
OF UTILITY ABROAD, NO TALENTS OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR HOME, TO OCCUPY.

BUT NOW, ANOTHER OCCUPATION AND SOLICITUDE OF MIND WAS BEGINNING TO BE
ADDED TO THESE.  HER FATHER WAS GROWING DISTRESSED FOR MONEY.
SHE KNEW, THAT WHEN HE NOW TOOK UP THE BARONETAGE, IT WAS TO DRIVE
THE HEAVY BILLS OF HIS TRADESPEOPLE, AND THE UNWELCOME HINTS OF
MR SHEPHERD, HIS AGENT, FROM HIS THOUGHTS.  THE KELLYNCH PROPERTY WAS GOOD,
BUT NOT EQUAL TO SIR WALTER'S APPREHENSION OF THE STATE REQUIRED
IN ITS POSSESSOR.  WHILE LADY ELLIOT LIVED, THERE HAD BEEN METHOD,
MODERATION, AND ECONOMY, WHICH HAD JUST KEPT HIM WITHIN HIS INCOME;
BUT WITH HER HAD DIED ALL SUCH RIGHT-MINDEDNESS, AND FROM THAT PERIOD
HE HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY EXCEEDING IT.  IT HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO SPEND LESS; HE HAD DONE NOTHING BUT WHAT SIR WALTER ELLIOT
WAS IMPERIOUSLY CALLED ON TO DO; BUT BLAMELESS AS HE WAS, HE WAS
NOT ONLY GROWING DREADFULLY IN DEBT, BUT WAS HEARING OF IT SO OFTEN,
THAT IT BECAME VAIN TO ATTEMPT CONCEALING IT LONGER, EVEN PARTIALLY,
FROM HIS DAUGHTER.  HE HAD GIVEN HER SOME HINTS OF IT THE LAST SPRING
IN TOWN; HE HAD GONE SO FAR EVEN AS TO SAY, "CAN WE RETRENCH?
DOES IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT THERE IS ANY ONE ARTICLE IN WHICH
WE CAN RETRENCH?" AND ELIZABETH, TO DO HER JUSTICE, HAD, IN THE FIRST
ARDOUR OF FEMALE ALARM, SET SERIOUSLY TO THINK WHAT COULD BE DONE,
AND HAD FINALLY PROPOSED THESE TWO BRANCHES OF ECONOMY, TO CUT OFF
SOME UNNECESSARY CHARITIES, AND TO REFRAIN FROM NEW FURNISHING
THE DRAWING-ROOM; TO WHICH EXPEDIENTS SHE AFTERWARDS ADDED
THE HAPPY THOUGHT OF THEIR TAKING NO PRESENT DOWN TO ANNE,
AS HAD BEEN THE USUAL YEARLY CUSTOM.  BUT THESE MEASURES,
HOWEVER GOOD IN THEMSELVES, WERE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE REAL EXTENT
OF THE EVIL, THE WHOLE OF WHICH SIR WALTER FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED
TO CONFESS TO HER SOON AFTERWARDS.  ELIZABETH HAD NOTHING TO PROPOSE
OF DEEPER EFFICACY.  SHE FELT HERSELF ILL-USED AND UNFORTUNATE,
AS DID HER FATHER; AND THEY WERE NEITHER OF THEM ABLE TO DEVISE
ANY MEANS OF LESSENING THEIR EXPENSES WITHOUT COMPROMISING THEIR DIGNITY,
OR RELINQUISHING THEIR COMFORTS IN A WAY NOT TO BE BORNE.

THERE WAS ONLY A SMALL PART OF HIS ESTATE THAT SIR WALTER COULD DISPOSE OF;
BUT HAD EVERY ACRE BEEN ALIENABLE, IT WOULD HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE.
HE HAD CONDESCENDED TO MORTGAGE AS FAR AS HE HAD THE POWER,
BUT HE WOULD NEVER CONDESCEND TO SELL.  NO; HE WOULD NEVER DISGRACE
HIS NAME SO FAR.  THE KELLYNCH ESTATE SHOULD BE TRANSMITTED WHOLE
AND ENTIRE, AS HE HAD RECEIVED IT.

THEIR TWO CONFIDENTIAL FRIENDS, MR SHEPHERD, WHO LIVED IN
THE NEIGHBOURING MARKET TOWN, AND LADY RUSSELL, WERE CALLED TO ADVISE THEM;
AND BOTH FATHER AND DAUGHTER SEEMED TO EXPECT THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE
STRUCK OUT BY ONE OR THE OTHER TO REMOVE THEIR EMBARRASSMENTS
AND REDUCE THEIR EXPENDITURE, WITHOUT INVOLVING THE LOSS OF
ANY INDULGENCE OF TASTE OR PRIDE.



CHAPTER 2


MR SHEPHERD, A CIVIL, CAUTIOUS LAWYER, WHO, WHATEVER MIGHT BE HIS HOLD
OR HIS VIEWS ON SIR WALTER, WOULD RATHER HAVE THE DISAGREEABLE
PROMPTED BY ANYBODY ELSE, EXCUSED HIMSELF FROM OFFERING THE SLIGHTEST HINT,
AND ONLY BEGGED LEAVE TO RECOMMEND AN IMPLICIT REFERENCE TO
THE EXCELLENT JUDGEMENT OF LADY RUSSELL, FROM WHOSE KNOWN GOOD SENSE
HE FULLY EXPECTED TO HAVE JUST SUCH RESOLUTE MEASURES ADVISED AS
HE MEANT TO SEE FINALLY ADOPTED.

LADY RUSSELL WAS MOST ANXIOUSLY ZEALOUS ON THE SUBJECT, AND GAVE IT
MUCH SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.  SHE WAS A WOMAN RATHER OF SOUND THAN OF
QUICK ABILITIES, WHOSE DIFFICULTIES IN COMING TO ANY DECISION
IN THIS INSTANCE WERE GREAT, FROM THE OPPOSITION OF TWO LEADING PRINCIPLES.
SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF, WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR;
BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS, AS SOLICITOUS
FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY, AS ARISTOCRATIC IN HER IDEAS OF WHAT
WAS DUE TO THEM, AS ANYBODY OF SENSE AND HONESTY COULD WELL BE.
SHE WAS A BENEVOLENT, CHARITABLE, GOOD WOMAN, AND CAPABLE OF
STRONG ATTACHMENTS, MOST CORRECT IN HER CONDUCT, STRICT IN HER NOTIONS
OF DECORUM, AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD-BREEDING.
SHE HAD A CULTIVATED MIND, AND WAS, GENERALLY SPEAKING,
RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT; BUT SHE HAD PREJUDICES ON THE SIDE OF ANCESTRY;
SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE, WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE
TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM.  HERSELF THE WIDOW OF
ONLY A KNIGHT, SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE;
AND SIR WALTER, INDEPENDENT OF HIS CLAIMS AS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE,
AN ATTENTIVE NEIGHBOUR, AN OBLIGING LANDLORD, THE HUSBAND OF HER
VERY DEAR FRIEND, THE FATHER OF ANNE AND HER SISTERS, WAS,
AS BEING SIR WALTER, IN HER APPREHENSION, ENTITLED TO A GREAT DEAL
OF COMPASSION AND CONSIDERATION UNDER HIS PRESENT DIFFICULTIES.

THEY MUST RETRENCH; THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT.  BUT SHE WAS
VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM
AND ELIZABETH. SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY, SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS,
AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING:  SHE CONSULTED ANNE,
WHO NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST
IN THE QUESTION. SHE CONSULTED, AND IN A DEGREE WAS INFLUENCED BY HER
IN MARKING OUT THE SCHEME OF RETRENCHMENT WHICH WAS AT LAST SUBMITTED
TO SIR WALTER. EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF
HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE.  SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES,
A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION, A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT,
A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY.

"IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS," SAID LADY RUSSELL,
LOOKING OVER HER PAPER, "MUCH MAY BE DONE.  IF HE WILL ADOPT
THESE REGULATIONS, IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR; AND I HOPE
WE MAY BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM AND ELIZABETH, THAT KELLYNCH HALL HAS
A RESPECTABILITY IN ITSELF WHICH CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY THESE REDUCTIONS;
AND THAT THE TRUE DIGNITY OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT WILL BE VERY FAR FROM
LESSENED IN THE EYES OF SENSIBLE PEOPLE, BY ACTING LIKE A MAN OF PRINCIPLE.
WHAT WILL HE BE DOING, IN FACT, BUT WHAT VERY MANY OF OUR FIRST FAMILIES
HAVE DONE, OR OUGHT TO DO?  THERE WILL BE NOTHING SINGULAR IN HIS CASE;
AND IT IS SINGULARITY WHICH OFTEN MAKES THE WORST PART OF OUR SUFFERING,
AS IT ALWAYS DOES OF OUR CONDUCT.  I HAVE GREAT HOPE OF PREVAILING.
WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED; FOR AFTER ALL, THE PERSON WHO
HAS CONTRACTED DEBTS MUST PAY THEM; AND THOUGH A GREAT DEAL IS DUE TO
THE FEELINGS OF THE GENTLEMAN, AND THE HEAD OF A HOUSE, LIKE YOUR FATHER,
THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN."

THIS WAS THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH ANNE WANTED HER FATHER TO BE PROCEEDING,
HIS FRIENDS TO BE URGING HIM.  SHE CONSIDERED IT AS AN ACT
OF INDISPENSABLE DUTY TO CLEAR AWAY THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS WITH
ALL THE EXPEDITION WHICH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RETRENCHMENTS
COULD SECURE, AND SAW NO DIGNITY IN ANYTHING SHORT OF IT.
SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED, AND FELT AS A DUTY.  SHE RATED
LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY; AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE
OF SELF-DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED, SHE BELIEVED
THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE,
THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION.  HER KNOWLEDGE OF HER FATHER
AND ELIZABETH INCLINED HER TO THINK THAT THE SACRIFICE OF ONE PAIR
OF HORSES WOULD BE HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN OF BOTH, AND SO ON,
THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS.

HOW ANNE'S MORE RIGID REQUISITIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN
IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE.  LADY RUSSELL'S HAD NO SUCCESS AT ALL:
COULD NOT BE PUT UP WITH, WERE NOT TO BE BORNE. "WHAT! EVERY COMFORT
OF LIFE KNOCKED OFF!  JOURNEYS, LONDON, SERVANTS, HORSES, TABLE--
CONTRACTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS EVERY WHERE!  TO LIVE NO LONGER
WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN!  NO, HE WOULD SOONER
QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE, THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS."

"QUIT KELLYNCH HALL."  THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MR SHEPHERD,
WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING,
AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT
A CHANGE OF ABODE.  "SINCE THE IDEA HAD BEEN STARTED IN THE VERY QUARTER
WHICH OUGHT TO DICTATE, HE HAD NO SCRUPLE," HE SAID, "IN CONFESSING
HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE.  IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM
THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING IN A HOUSE
WHICH HAD SUCH A CHARACTER OF HOSPITALITY AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT.
IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF; AND WOULD
BE LOOKED UP TO, AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE IN WHATEVER WAY
HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD."

SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT KELLYNCH HALL; AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE
OF DOUBT AND INDECISION, THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO
WAS SETTLED, AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT.

THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES, LONDON, BATH, OR ANOTHER HOUSE
IN THE COUNTRY.  ALL ANNE'S WISHES HAD BEEN FOR THE LATTER.
A SMALL HOUSE IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHERE THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE
LADY RUSSELL'S SOCIETY, STILL BE NEAR MARY, AND STILL HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF SOMETIMES SEEING THE LAWNS AND GROVES OF KELLYNCH, WAS THE OBJECT
OF HER AMBITION.  BUT THE USUAL FATE OF ANNE ATTENDED HER,
IN HAVING SOMETHING VERY OPPOSITE FROM HER INCLINATION FIXED ON.
SHE DISLIKED BATH, AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER;
AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME.

SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON; BUT MR SHEPHERD FELT
THAT HE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED IN LONDON, AND HAD BEEN SKILFUL ENOUGH
TO DISSUADE HIM FROM IT, AND MAKE BATH PREFERRED.  IT WAS A MUCH SAFER
PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT:  HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT
AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE.  TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH
OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT:  ITS MORE CONVENIENT
DISTANCE FROM KELLYNCH, ONLY FIFTY MILES, AND LADY RUSSELL'S SPENDING
SOME PART OF EVERY WINTER THERE; AND TO THE VERY GREAT SATISFACTION
OF LADY RUSSELL, WHOSE FIRST VIEWS ON THE PROJECTED CHANGE HAD BEEN
FOR BATH, SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT
THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE.

LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES.
IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT SIR WALTER TO DESCEND INTO A SMALL HOUSE
IN HIS OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD.  ANNE HERSELF WOULD HAVE FOUND
THE MORTIFICATIONS OF IT MORE THAN SHE FORESAW, AND TO SIR WALTER'S
FEELINGS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFUL.  AND WITH REGARD TO ANNE'S
DISLIKE OF BATH, SHE CONSIDERED IT AS A PREJUDICE AND MISTAKE ARISING,
FIRST, FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER HAVING BEEN THREE YEARS
AT SCHOOL THERE, AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH; AND SECONDLY,
FROM HER HAPPENING TO BE NOT IN PERFECTLY GOOD SPIRITS THE ONLY WINTER
WHICH SHE HAD AFTERWARDS SPENT THERE WITH HERSELF.

LADY RUSSELL WAS FOND OF BATH, IN SHORT, AND DISPOSED TO THINK
IT MUST SUIT THEM ALL; AND AS TO HER YOUNG FRIEND'S HEALTH,
BY PASSING ALL THE WARM MONTHS WITH HER AT KELLYNCH LODGE,
EVERY DANGER WOULD BE AVOIDED; AND IT WAS IN FACT, A CHANGE WHICH MUST
DO BOTH HEALTH AND SPIRITS GOOD.  ANNE HAD BEEN TOO LITTLE FROM HOME,
TOO LITTLE SEEN. HER SPIRITS WERE NOT HIGH.  A LARGER SOCIETY
WOULD IMPROVE THEM.  SHE WANTED HER TO BE MORE KNOWN.

THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD
FOR SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART,
AND A VERY MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME, WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY
ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING.  HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME,
BUT TO SEE IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS; A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE,
WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH.
KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET.  THIS, HOWEVER, WAS A PROFOUND SECRET,
NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN CIRCLE.

SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN
TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE.  MR SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD
"ADVERTISE," BUT NEVER DARED APPROACH IT AGAIN.  SIR WALTER SPURNED
THE IDEA OF ITS BEING OFFERED IN ANY MANNER; FORBAD THE SLIGHTEST HINT
BEING DROPPED OF HIS HAVING SUCH AN INTENTION; AND IT WAS ONLY ON
THE SUPPOSITION OF HIS BEING SPONTANEOUSLY SOLICITED BY SOME MOST
UNEXCEPTIONABLE APPLICANT, ON HIS OWN TERMS, AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR,
THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL.

HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE!  LADY RUSSELL HAD
ANOTHER EXCELLENT ONE AT HAND, FOR BEING EXTREMELY GLAD THAT SIR WALTER
AND HIS FAMILY WERE TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY.  ELIZABETH HAD BEEN
LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY, WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED.
IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MR SHEPHERD, WHO HAD RETURNED,
AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE, TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE, WITH
THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN.  SHE WAS A CLEVER YOUNG WOMAN,
WHO UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF PLEASING--THE ART OF PLEASING, AT LEAST,
AT KELLYNCH HALL; AND WHO HAD MADE HERSELF SO ACCEPTABLE TO MISS ELLIOT,
AS TO HAVE BEEN ALREADY STAYING THERE MORE THAN ONCE, IN SPITE OF ALL
THAT LADY RUSSELL, WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE,
COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE.

LADY RUSSELL, INDEED, HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH,
AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER, RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER,
THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT.  SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE
THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION, NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE;
HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY,
AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION.  SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST
IN TRYING TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON, SENSIBLY OPEN
TO ALL THE INJUSTICE AND ALL THE DISCREDIT OF THE SELFISH ARRANGEMENTS
WHICH SHUT HER OUT, AND ON MANY LESSER OCCASIONS HAD ENDEAVOURED
TO GIVE ELIZABETH THE ADVANTAGE OF HER OWN BETTER JUDGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE;
BUT ALWAYS IN VAIN:  ELIZABETH WOULD GO HER OWN WAY; AND NEVER HAD SHE
PURSUED IT IN MORE DECIDED OPPOSITION TO LADY RUSSELL THAN IN
THIS SELECTION OF MRS CLAY; TURNING FROM THE SOCIETY OF SO DESERVING
A SISTER, TO BESTOW HER AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE ON ONE WHO OUGHT
TO HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY.

FROM SITUATION, MRS CLAY WAS, IN LADY RUSSELL'S ESTIMATE, A VERY UNEQUAL,
AND IN HER CHARACTER SHE BELIEVED A VERY DANGEROUS COMPANION;
AND A REMOVAL THAT WOULD LEAVE MRS CLAY BEHIND, AND BRING A CHOICE
OF MORE SUITABLE INTIMATES WITHIN MISS ELLIOT'S REACH, WAS THEREFORE
AN OBJECT OF FIRST-RATE IMPORTANCE.



CHAPTER 3


"I MUST TAKE LEAVE TO OBSERVE, SIR WALTER," SAID MR SHEPHERD
ONE MORNING AT KELLYNCH HALL, AS HE LAID DOWN THE NEWSPAPER,
"THAT THE PRESENT JUNCTURE IS MUCH IN OUR FAVOUR.  THIS PEACE WILL
BE TURNING ALL OUR RICH NAVAL OFFICERS ASHORE.  THEY WILL BE
ALL WANTING A HOME.  COULD NOT BE A BETTER TIME, SIR WALTER,
FOR HAVING A CHOICE OF TENANTS, VERY RESPONSIBLE TENANTS.
MANY A NOBLE FORTUNE HAS BEEN MADE DURING THE WAR.  IF A RICH ADMIRAL
WERE TO COME IN OUR WAY, SIR WALTER--"

"HE WOULD BE A VERY LUCKY MAN, SHEPHERD," REPLIED SIR WALTER;
"THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO REMARK.  A PRIZE INDEED WOULD KELLYNCH HALL
BE TO HIM; RATHER THE GREATEST PRIZE OF ALL, LET HIM HAVE TAKEN
EVER SO MANY BEFORE; HEY, SHEPHERD?"

MR SHEPHERD LAUGHED, AS HE KNEW HE MUST, AT THIS WIT, AND THEN ADDED--

"I PRESUME TO OBSERVE, SIR WALTER, THAT, IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS,
GENTLEMEN OF THE NAVY ARE WELL TO DEAL WITH.  I HAVE HAD A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE
OF THEIR METHODS OF DOING BUSINESS; AND I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THEY
HAVE VERY LIBERAL NOTIONS, AND ARE AS LIKELY TO MAKE DESIRABLE TENANTS
AS ANY SET OF PEOPLE ONE SHOULD MEET WITH.  THEREFORE, SIR WALTER,
WHAT I WOULD TAKE LEAVE TO SUGGEST IS, THAT IF IN CONSEQUENCE OF
ANY RUMOURS GETTING ABROAD OF YOUR INTENTION; WHICH MUST BE CONTEMPLATED
AS A POSSIBLE THING, BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO KEEP
THE ACTIONS AND DESIGNS OF ONE PART OF THE WORLD FROM THE NOTICE
AND CURIOSITY OF THE OTHER; CONSEQUENCE HAS ITS TAX; I, JOHN SHEPHERD,
MIGHT CONCEAL ANY FAMILY-MATTERS THAT I CHOSE, FOR NOBODY WOULD THINK IT
WORTH THEIR WHILE TO OBSERVE ME; BUT SIR WALTER ELLIOT HAS EYES UPON HIM
WHICH IT MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ELUDE; AND THEREFORE, THUS MUCH
I VENTURE UPON, THAT IT WILL NOT GREATLY SURPRISE ME IF,
WITH ALL OUR CAUTION, SOME RUMOUR OF THE TRUTH SHOULD GET ABROAD;
IN THE SUPPOSITION OF WHICH, AS I WAS GOING TO OBSERVE, SINCE APPLICATIONS
WILL UNQUESTIONABLY FOLLOW, I SHOULD THINK ANY FROM OUR WEALTHY
NAVAL COMMANDERS PARTICULARLY WORTH ATTENDING TO; AND BEG LEAVE TO ADD,
THAT TWO HOURS WILL BRING ME OVER AT ANY TIME, TO SAVE YOU
THE TROUBLE OF REPLYING."

SIR WALTER ONLY NODDED.  BUT SOON AFTERWARDS, RISING AND PACING THE ROOM,
HE OBSERVED SARCASTICALLY--

"THERE ARE FEW AMONG THE GENTLEMEN OF THE NAVY, I IMAGINE, WHO WOULD
NOT BE SURPRISED TO FIND THEMSELVES IN A HOUSE OF THIS DESCRIPTION."

"THEY WOULD LOOK AROUND THEM, NO DOUBT, AND BLESS THEIR GOOD FORTUNE,"
SAID MRS CLAY, FOR MRS CLAY WAS PRESENT:  HER FATHER HAD DRIVEN HER OVER,
NOTHING BEING OF SO MUCH USE TO MRS CLAY'S HEALTH AS A DRIVE TO KELLYNCH:
"BUT I QUITE AGREE WITH MY FATHER IN THINKING A SAILOR MIGHT BE
A VERY DESIRABLE TENANT.  I HAVE KNOWN A GOOD DEAL OF THE PROFESSION;
AND BESIDES THEIR LIBERALITY, THEY ARE SO NEAT AND CAREFUL
IN ALL THEIR WAYS!  THESE VALUABLE PICTURES OF YOURS, SIR WALTER,
IF YOU CHOSE TO LEAVE THEM, WOULD BE PERFECTLY SAFE.  EVERYTHING IN
AND ABOUT THE HOUSE WOULD BE TAKEN SUCH EXCELLENT CARE OF!
THE GARDENS AND SHRUBBERIES WOULD BE KEPT IN ALMOST AS HIGH ORDER
AS THEY ARE NOW.  YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID, MISS ELLIOT, OF YOUR OWN
SWEET FLOWER GARDENS BEING NEGLECTED."

"AS TO ALL THAT," REJOINED SIR WALTER COOLLY, "SUPPOSING I WERE INDUCED
TO LET MY HOUSE, I HAVE BY NO MEANS MADE UP MY MIND AS TO THE PRIVILEGES
TO BE ANNEXED TO IT.  I AM NOT PARTICULARLY DISPOSED TO FAVOUR A TENANT.
THE PARK WOULD BE OPEN TO HIM OF COURSE, AND FEW NAVY OFFICERS,
OR MEN OF ANY OTHER DESCRIPTION, CAN HAVE HAD SUCH A RANGE;
BUT WHAT RESTRICTIONS I MIGHT IMPOSE ON THE USE OF THE PLEASURE-GROUNDS,
IS ANOTHER THING.  I AM NOT FOND OF THE IDEA OF MY SHRUBBERIES BEING
ALWAYS APPROACHABLE; AND I SHOULD RECOMMEND MISS ELLIOT TO BE ON HER GUARD
WITH RESPECT TO HER FLOWER GARDEN.  I AM VERY LITTLE DISPOSED
TO GRANT A TENANT OF KELLYNCH HALL ANY EXTRAORDINARY FAVOUR,
I ASSURE YOU, BE HE SAILOR OR SOLDIER."

AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, MR SHEPHERD PRESUMED TO SAY--

"IN ALL THESE CASES, THERE ARE ESTABLISHED USAGES WHICH
MAKE EVERYTHING PLAIN AND EASY BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT.
YOUR INTEREST, SIR WALTER, IS IN PRETTY SAFE HANDS.  DEPEND UPON ME
FOR TAKING CARE THAT NO TENANT HAS MORE THAN HIS JUST RIGHTS.
I VENTURE TO HINT, THAT SIR WALTER ELLIOT CANNOT BE HALF SO JEALOUS
FOR HIS OWN, AS JOHN SHEPHERD WILL BE FOR HIM."

HERE ANNE SPOKE--

"THE NAVY, I THINK, WHO HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR US, HAVE AT LEAST
AN EQUAL CLAIM WITH ANY OTHER SET OF MEN, FOR ALL THE COMFORTS AND
ALL THE PRIVILEGES WHICH ANY HOME CAN GIVE.  SAILORS WORK HARD ENOUGH
FOR THEIR COMFORTS, WE MUST ALL ALLOW."

"VERY TRUE, VERY TRUE.  WHAT MISS ANNE SAYS, IS VERY TRUE,"
WAS MR SHEPHERD'S REJOINDER, AND "OH! CERTAINLY," WAS HIS DAUGHTER'S;
BUT SIR WALTER'S REMARK WAS, SOON AFTERWARDS--

"THE PROFESSION HAS ITS UTILITY, BUT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO SEE
ANY FRIEND OF MINE BELONGING TO IT."

"INDEED!" WAS THE REPLY, AND WITH A LOOK OF SURPRISE.

"YES; IT IS IN TWO POINTS OFFENSIVE TO ME; I HAVE TWO STRONG GROUNDS
OF OBJECTION TO IT.  FIRST, AS BEING THE MEANS OF BRINGING PERSONS
OF OBSCURE BIRTH INTO UNDUE DISTINCTION, AND RAISING MEN TO HONOURS
WHICH THEIR FATHERS AND GRANDFATHERS NEVER DREAMT OF; AND SECONDLY,
AS IT CUTS UP A MAN'S YOUTH AND VIGOUR MOST HORRIBLY; A SAILOR GROWS OLD
SOONER THAN ANY OTHER MAN.  I HAVE OBSERVED IT ALL MY LIFE.
A MAN IS IN GREATER DANGER IN THE NAVY OF BEING INSULTED BY THE RISE
OF ONE WHOSE FATHER, HIS FATHER MIGHT HAVE DISDAINED TO SPEAK TO,
AND OF BECOMING PREMATURELY AN OBJECT OF DISGUST HIMSELF, THAN IN
ANY OTHER LINE.  ONE DAY LAST SPRING, IN TOWN, I WAS IN COMPANY
WITH TWO MEN, STRIKING INSTANCES OF WHAT I AM TALKING OF;
LORD ST IVES, WHOSE FATHER WE ALL KNOW TO HAVE BEEN A COUNTRY CURATE,
WITHOUT BREAD TO EAT; I WAS TO GIVE PLACE TO LORD ST IVES,
AND A CERTAIN ADMIRAL BALDWIN, THE MOST DEPLORABLE-LOOKING PERSONAGE
YOU CAN IMAGINE; HIS FACE THE COLOUR OF MAHOGANY, ROUGH AND RUGGED
TO THE LAST DEGREE; ALL LINES AND WRINKLES, NINE GREY HAIRS OF A SIDE,
AND NOTHING BUT A DAB OF POWDER AT TOP.  `IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN,
WHO IS THAT OLD FELLOW?' SAID I TO A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS STANDING NEAR,
(SIR BASIL MORLEY).  `OLD FELLOW!' CRIED SIR BASIL, `IT IS ADMIRAL BALDWIN.
WHAT DO YOU TAKE HIS AGE TO BE?'  `SIXTY,' SAID I, `OR PERHAPS SIXTY-TWO.'
`FORTY,' REPLIED SIR BASIL, `FORTY, AND NO MORE.'  PICTURE TO YOURSELVES
MY AMAZEMENT; I SHALL NOT EASILY FORGET ADMIRAL BALDWIN.
I NEVER SAW QUITE SO WRETCHED AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT A SEA-FARING LIFE CAN DO;
BUT TO A DEGREE, I KNOW IT IS THE SAME WITH THEM ALL:  THEY ARE ALL
KNOCKED ABOUT, AND EXPOSED TO EVERY CLIMATE, AND EVERY WEATHER,
TILL THEY ARE NOT FIT TO BE SEEN.  IT IS A PITY THEY ARE NOT KNOCKED
ON THE HEAD AT ONCE, BEFORE THEY REACH ADMIRAL BALDWIN'S AGE."

"NAY, SIR WALTER," CRIED MRS CLAY, "THIS IS BEING SEVERE INDEED.
HAVE A LITTLE MERCY ON THE POOR MEN.  WE ARE NOT ALL BORN TO BE HANDSOME.
THE SEA IS NO BEAUTIFIER, CERTAINLY; SAILORS DO GROW OLD BETIMES;
I HAVE OBSERVED IT; THEY SOON LOSE THE LOOK OF YOUTH.  BUT THEN,
IS NOT IT THE SAME WITH MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS, PERHAPS MOST OTHER?
SOLDIERS, IN ACTIVE SERVICE, ARE NOT AT ALL BETTER OFF:  AND EVEN IN
THE QUIETER PROFESSIONS, THERE IS A TOIL AND A LABOUR OF THE MIND,
IF NOT OF THE BODY, WHICH SELDOM LEAVES A MAN'S LOOKS TO THE NATURAL
EFFECT OF TIME.  THE LAWYER PLODS, QUITE CARE-WORN; THE PHYSICIAN
IS UP AT ALL HOURS, AND TRAVELLING IN ALL WEATHER; AND EVEN
THE CLERGYMAN--" SHE STOPT A MOMENT TO CONSIDER WHAT MIGHT
DO FOR THE CLERGYMAN;--"AND EVEN THE CLERGYMAN, YOU KNOW IS OBLIGED
TO GO INTO INFECTED ROOMS, AND EXPOSE HIS HEALTH AND LOOKS TO
ALL THE INJURY OF A POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE.  IN FACT, AS I HAVE
LONG BEEN CONVINCED, THOUGH EVERY PROFESSION IS NECESSARY AND HONOURABLE
IN ITS TURN, IT IS ONLY THE LOT OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT OBLIGED TO FOLLOW ANY,
WHO CAN LIVE IN A REGULAR WAY, IN THE COUNTRY, CHOOSING THEIR OWN HOURS,
FOLLOWING THEIR OWN PURSUITS, AND LIVING ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY,
WITHOUT THE TORMENT OF TRYING FOR MORE; IT IS ONLY THEIR LOT, I SAY,
TO HOLD THE BLESSINGS OF HEALTH AND A GOOD APPEARANCE TO THE UTMOST:
I KNOW NO OTHER SET OF MEN BUT WHAT LOSE SOMETHING OF THEIR PERSONABLENESS
WHEN THEY CEASE TO BE QUITE YOUNG."

IT SEEMED AS IF MR SHEPHERD, IN THIS ANXIETY TO BESPEAK
SIR WALTER'S GOOD WILL TOWARDS A NAVAL OFFICER AS TENANT,
HAD BEEN GIFTED WITH FORESIGHT; FOR THE VERY FIRST APPLICATION
FOR THE HOUSE WAS FROM AN ADMIRAL CROFT, WITH WHOM HE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS
FELL INTO COMPANY IN ATTENDING THE QUARTER SESSIONS AT TAUNTON; AND INDEED,
HE HAD RECEIVED A HINT OF THE ADMIRAL FROM A LONDON CORRESPONDENT.
BY THE REPORT WHICH HE HASTENED OVER TO KELLYNCH TO MAKE,
ADMIRAL CROFT WAS A NATIVE OF SOMERSETSHIRE, WHO HAVING ACQUIRED
A VERY HANDSOME FORTUNE, WAS WISHING TO SETTLE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY,
AND HAD COME DOWN TO TAUNTON IN ORDER TO LOOK AT SOME ADVERTISED PLACES
IN THAT IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHICH, HOWEVER, HAD NOT SUITED HIM;
THAT ACCIDENTALLY HEARING--(IT WAS JUST AS HE HAD FORETOLD,
MR SHEPHERD OBSERVED, SIR WALTER'S CONCERNS COULD NOT BE KEPT A SECRET,)--
ACCIDENTALLY HEARING OF THE POSSIBILITY OF KELLYNCH HALL BEING TO LET,
AND UNDERSTANDING HIS (MR SHEPHERD'S) CONNECTION WITH THE OWNER,
HE HAD INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE PARTICULAR INQUIRIES,
AND HAD, IN THE COURSE OF A PRETTY LONG CONFERENCE, EXPRESSED AS STRONG
AN INCLINATION FOR THE PLACE AS A MAN WHO KNEW IT ONLY BY DESCRIPTION
COULD FEEL; AND GIVEN MR SHEPHERD, IN HIS EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF,
EVERY PROOF OF HIS BEING A MOST RESPONSIBLE, ELIGIBLE TENANT.

"AND WHO IS ADMIRAL CROFT?" WAS SIR WALTER'S COLD SUSPICIOUS INQUIRY.

MR SHEPHERD ANSWERED FOR HIS BEING OF A GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY,
AND MENTIONED A PLACE; AND ANNE, AFTER THE LITTLE PAUSE WHICH FOLLOWED,
ADDED--

"HE IS A REAR ADMIRAL OF THE WHITE.  HE WAS IN THE TRAFALGAR ACTION,
AND HAS BEEN IN THE EAST INDIES SINCE; HE WAS STATIONED THERE,
I BELIEVE, SEVERAL YEARS."

"THEN I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED," OBSERVED SIR WALTER, "THAT HIS FACE
IS ABOUT AS ORANGE AS THE CUFFS AND CAPES OF MY LIVERY."

MR SHEPHERD HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM, THAT ADMIRAL CROFT WAS A VERY HALE,
HEARTY, WELL-LOOKING MAN, A LITTLE WEATHER-BEATEN, TO BE SURE,
BUT NOT MUCH, AND QUITE THE GENTLEMAN IN ALL HIS NOTIONS AND BEHAVIOUR;
NOT LIKELY TO MAKE THE SMALLEST DIFFICULTY ABOUT TERMS, ONLY WANTED
A COMFORTABLE HOME, AND TO GET INTO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE;
KNEW HE MUST PAY FOR HIS CONVENIENCE; KNEW WHAT RENT A READY-FURNISHED
HOUSE OF THAT CONSEQUENCE MIGHT FETCH; SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
IF SIR WALTER HAD ASKED MORE; HAD INQUIRED ABOUT THE MANOR;
WOULD BE GLAD OF THE DEPUTATION, CERTAINLY, BUT MADE NO GREAT POINT OF IT;
SAID HE SOMETIMES TOOK OUT A GUN, BUT NEVER KILLED; QUITE THE GENTLEMAN.

MR SHEPHERD WAS ELOQUENT ON THE SUBJECT; POINTING OUT ALL
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ADMIRAL'S FAMILY, WHICH MADE HIM
PECULIARLY DESIRABLE AS A TENANT.  HE WAS A MARRIED MAN,
AND WITHOUT CHILDREN; THE VERY STATE TO BE WISHED FOR.  A HOUSE WAS
NEVER TAKEN GOOD CARE OF, MR SHEPHERD OBSERVED, WITHOUT A LADY:
HE DID NOT KNOW, WHETHER FURNITURE MIGHT NOT BE IN DANGER OF SUFFERING
AS MUCH WHERE THERE WAS NO LADY, AS WHERE THERE WERE MANY CHILDREN.
A LADY, WITHOUT A FAMILY, WAS THE VERY BEST PRESERVER OF FURNITURE
IN THE WORLD.  HE HAD SEEN MRS CROFT, TOO; SHE WAS AT TAUNTON
WITH THE ADMIRAL, AND HAD BEEN PRESENT ALMOST ALL THE TIME THEY WERE
TALKING THE MATTER OVER.

"AND A VERY WELL-SPOKEN, GENTEEL, SHREWD LADY, SHE SEEMED TO BE,"
CONTINUED HE; "ASKED MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HOUSE, AND TERMS,
AND TAXES, THAN THE ADMIRAL HIMSELF, AND SEEMED MORE CONVERSANT
WITH BUSINESS; AND MOREOVER, SIR WALTER, I FOUND SHE WAS NOT QUITE
UNCONNECTED IN THIS COUNTRY, ANY MORE THAN HER HUSBAND; THAT IS TO SAY,
SHE IS SISTER TO A GENTLEMAN WHO DID LIVE AMONGST US ONCE;
SHE TOLD ME SO HERSELF:  SISTER TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED
A FEW YEARS BACK AT MONKFORD.  BLESS ME! WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
AT THIS MOMENT I CANNOT RECOLLECT HIS NAME, THOUGH I HAVE HEARD IT SO LATELY.
PENELOPE, MY DEAR, CAN YOU HELP ME TO THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN
WHO LIVED AT MONKFORD:  MRS CROFT'S BROTHER?"

BUT MRS CLAY WAS TALKING SO EAGERLY WITH MISS ELLIOT, THAT SHE DID NOT
HEAR THE APPEAL.

"I HAVE NO CONCEPTION WHOM YOU CAN MEAN, SHEPHERD; I REMEMBER
NO GENTLEMAN RESIDENT AT MONKFORD SINCE THE TIME OF OLD GOVERNOR TRENT."

"BLESS ME! HOW VERY ODD!  I SHALL FORGET MY OWN NAME SOON, I SUPPOSE.
A NAME THAT I AM SO VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH; KNEW THE GENTLEMAN
SO WELL BY SIGHT; SEEN HIM A HUNDRED TIMES; CAME TO CONSULT ME ONCE,
I REMEMBER, ABOUT A TRESPASS OF ONE OF HIS NEIGHBOURS; FARMER'S MAN
BREAKING INTO HIS ORCHARD; WALL TORN DOWN; APPLES STOLEN;
CAUGHT IN THE FACT; AND AFTERWARDS, CONTRARY TO MY JUDGEMENT,
SUBMITTED TO AN AMICABLE COMPROMISE.  VERY ODD INDEED!"

AFTER WAITING ANOTHER MOMENT--

"YOU MEAN MR WENTWORTH, I SUPPOSE?" SAID ANNE.

MR SHEPHERD WAS ALL GRATITUDE.

"WENTWORTH WAS THE VERY NAME!  MR WENTWORTH WAS THE VERY MAN.
HE HAD THE CURACY OF MONKFORD, YOU KNOW, SIR WALTER, SOME TIME BACK,
FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS.  CAME THERE ABOUT THE YEAR ---5, I TAKE IT.
YOU REMEMBER HIM, I AM SURE."

"WENTWORTH?  OH! AY,--MR WENTWORTH, THE CURATE OF MONKFORD.
YOU MISLED ME BY THE TERM GENTLEMAN.  I THOUGHT YOU WERE SPEAKING OF
SOME MAN OF PROPERTY:  MR WENTWORTH WAS NOBODY, I REMEMBER;
QUITE UNCONNECTED; NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STRAFFORD FAMILY.
ONE WONDERS HOW THE NAMES OF MANY OF OUR NOBILITY BECOME SO COMMON."

AS MR SHEPHERD PERCEIVED THAT THIS CONNEXION OF THE CROFTS DID THEM
NO SERVICE WITH SIR WALTER, HE MENTIONED IT NO MORE; RETURNING,
WITH ALL HIS ZEAL, TO DWELL ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES MORE INDISPUTABLY
IN THEIR FAVOUR; THEIR AGE, AND NUMBER, AND FORTUNE; THE HIGH IDEA
THEY HAD FORMED OF KELLYNCH HALL, AND EXTREME SOLICITUDE FOR
THE ADVANTAGE OF RENTING IT; MAKING IT APPEAR AS IF THEY RANKED
NOTHING BEYOND THE HAPPINESS OF BEING THE TENANTS OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT:
AN EXTRAORDINARY TASTE, CERTAINLY, COULD THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED IN
THE SECRET OF SIR WALTER'S ESTIMATE OF THE DUES OF A TENANT.

IT SUCCEEDED, HOWEVER; AND THOUGH SIR WALTER MUST EVER LOOK WITH
AN EVIL EYE ON ANYONE INTENDING TO INHABIT THAT HOUSE, AND THINK THEM
INFINITELY TOO WELL OFF IN BEING PERMITTED TO RENT IT ON THE HIGHEST TERMS,
HE WAS TALKED INTO ALLOWING MR SHEPHERD TO PROCEED IN THE TREATY,
AND AUTHORISING HIM TO WAIT ON ADMIRAL CROFT, WHO STILL REMAINED
AT TAUNTON, AND FIX A DAY FOR THE HOUSE BEING SEEN.

SIR WALTER WAS NOT VERY WISE; BUT STILL HE HAD EXPERIENCE ENOUGH
OF THE WORLD TO FEEL, THAT A MORE UNOBJECTIONABLE TENANT,
IN ALL ESSENTIALS, THAN ADMIRAL CROFT BID FAIR TO BE, COULD HARDLY OFFER.
SO FAR WENT HIS UNDERSTANDING; AND HIS VANITY SUPPLIED A LITTLE
ADDITIONAL SOOTHING, IN THE ADMIRAL'S SITUATION IN LIFE, WHICH WAS JUST
HIGH ENOUGH, AND NOT TOO HIGH.  "I HAVE LET MY HOUSE TO ADMIRAL CROFT,"
WOULD SOUND EXTREMELY WELL; VERY MUCH BETTER THAN TO ANY MERE MR--;
A MR (SAVE, PERHAPS, SOME HALF DOZEN IN THE NATION,) ALWAYS NEEDS
A NOTE OF EXPLANATION.  AN ADMIRAL SPEAKS HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE,
AND, AT THE SAME TIME, CAN NEVER MAKE A BARONET LOOK SMALL.
IN ALL THEIR DEALINGS AND INTERCOURSE, SIR WALTER ELLIOT MUST EVER
HAVE THE PRECEDENCE.

NOTHING COULD BE DONE WITHOUT A REFERENCE TO ELIZABETH:
BUT HER INCLINATION WAS GROWING SO STRONG FOR A REMOVAL,
THAT SHE WAS HAPPY TO HAVE IT FIXED AND EXPEDITED BY A TENANT AT HAND;
AND NOT A WORD TO SUSPEND DECISION WAS UTTERED BY HER.

MR SHEPHERD WAS COMPLETELY EMPOWERED TO ACT; AND NO SOONER HAD
SUCH AN END BEEN REACHED, THAN ANNE, WHO HAD BEEN A MOST ATTENTIVE LISTENER
TO THE WHOLE, LEFT THE ROOM, TO SEEK THE COMFORT OF COOL AIR FOR HER
FLUSHED CHEEKS; AND AS SHE WALKED ALONG A FAVOURITE GROVE, SAID,
WITH A GENTLE SIGH, "A FEW MONTHS MORE, AND HE, PERHAPS,
MAY BE WALKING HERE."



CHAPTER 4


HE WAS NOT MR WENTWORTH, THE FORMER CURATE OF MONKFORD,
HOWEVER SUSPICIOUS APPEARANCES MAY BE, BUT A CAPTAIN FREDERICK WENTWORTH,
HIS BROTHER, WHO BEING MADE COMMANDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACTION
OFF ST DOMINGO, AND NOT IMMEDIATELY EMPLOYED, HAD COME INTO SOMERSETSHIRE,
IN THE SUMMER OF 1806; AND HAVING NO PARENT LIVING, FOUND A HOME
FOR HALF A YEAR AT MONKFORD.  HE WAS, AT THAT TIME, A REMARKABLY FINE
YOUNG MAN, WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE, SPIRIT, AND BRILLIANCY;
AND ANNE AN EXTREMELY PRETTY GIRL, WITH GENTLENESS, MODESTY, TASTE,
AND FEELING.  HALF THE SUM OF ATTRACTION, ON EITHER SIDE, MIGHT HAVE
BEEN ENOUGH, FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO DO, AND SHE HAD HARDLY ANYBODY TO LOVE;
BUT THE ENCOUNTER OF SUCH LAVISH RECOMMENDATIONS COULD NOT FAIL.
THEY WERE GRADUALLY ACQUAINTED, AND WHEN ACQUAINTED, RAPIDLY AND
DEEPLY IN LOVE.  IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH HAD SEEN
HIGHEST PERFECTION IN THE OTHER, OR WHICH HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST:
SHE, IN RECEIVING HIS DECLARATIONS AND PROPOSALS, OR HE IN
HAVING THEM ACCEPTED.

A SHORT PERIOD OF EXQUISITE FELICITY FOLLOWED, AND BUT A SHORT ONE.
TROUBLES SOON AROSE.  SIR WALTER, ON BEING APPLIED TO, WITHOUT ACTUALLY
WITHHOLDING HIS CONSENT, OR SAYING IT SHOULD NEVER BE, GAVE IT ALL
THE NEGATIVE OF GREAT ASTONISHMENT, GREAT COLDNESS, GREAT SILENCE,
AND A PROFESSED RESOLUTION OF DOING NOTHING FOR HIS DAUGHTER.
HE THOUGHT IT A VERY DEGRADING ALLIANCE; AND LADY RUSSELL, THOUGH WITH
MORE TEMPERED AND PARDONABLE PRIDE, RECEIVED IT AS A MOST UNFORTUNATE ONE.

ANNE ELLIOT, WITH ALL HER CLAIMS OF BIRTH, BEAUTY, AND MIND,
TO THROW HERSELF AWAY AT NINETEEN; INVOLVE HERSELF AT NINETEEN
IN AN ENGAGEMENT WITH A YOUNG MAN, WHO HAD NOTHING BUT HIMSELF
TO RECOMMEND HIM, AND NO HOPES OF ATTAINING AFFLUENCE, BUT IN THE CHANCES
OF A MOST UNCERTAIN PROFESSION, AND NO CONNEXIONS TO SECURE
EVEN HIS FARTHER RISE IN THE PROFESSION, WOULD BE, INDEED, A THROWING AWAY,
WHICH SHE GRIEVED TO THINK OF!  ANNE ELLIOT, SO YOUNG; KNOWN TO SO FEW,
TO BE SNATCHED OFF BY A STRANGER WITHOUT ALLIANCE OR FORTUNE;
OR RATHER SUNK BY HIM INTO A STATE OF MOST WEARING, ANXIOUS,
YOUTH-KILLING DEPENDENCE!  IT MUST NOT BE, IF BY ANY FAIR INTERFERENCE
OF FRIENDSHIP, ANY REPRESENTATIONS FROM ONE WHO HAD ALMOST A MOTHER'S LOVE,
AND MOTHER'S RIGHTS, IT WOULD BE PREVENTED.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD NO FORTUNE.  HE HAD BEEN LUCKY IN HIS PROFESSION;
BUT SPENDING FREELY, WHAT HAD COME FREELY, HAD REALIZED NOTHING.
BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SOON BE RICH:
FULL OF LIFE AND ARDOUR, HE KNEW THAT HE SHOULD SOON HAVE A SHIP,
AND SOON BE ON A STATION THAT WOULD LEAD TO EVERYTHING HE WANTED.
HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN LUCKY; HE KNEW HE SHOULD BE SO STILL.
SUCH CONFIDENCE, POWERFUL IN ITS OWN WARMTH, AND BEWITCHING IN
THE WIT WHICH OFTEN EXPRESSED IT, MUST HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR ANNE;
BUT LADY RUSSELL SAW IT VERY DIFFERENTLY.  HIS SANGUINE TEMPER,
AND FEARLESSNESS OF MIND, OPERATED VERY DIFFERENTLY ON HER.
SHE SAW IN IT BUT AN AGGRAVATION OF THE EVIL.  IT ONLY ADDED A
DANGEROUS CHARACTER TO HIMSELF.  HE WAS BRILLIANT, HE WAS HEADSTRONG.
LADY RUSSELL HAD LITTLE TASTE FOR WIT, AND OF ANYTHING APPROACHING
TO IMPRUDENCE A HORROR.  SHE DEPRECATED THE CONNEXION IN EVERY LIGHT.

SUCH OPPOSITION, AS THESE FEELINGS PRODUCED, WAS MORE THAN
ANNE COULD COMBAT.  YOUNG AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS, IT MIGHT YET
HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO WITHSTAND HER FATHER'S ILL-WILL,
THOUGH UNSOFTENED BY ONE KIND WORD OR LOOK ON THE PART OF HER SISTER;
BUT LADY RUSSELL, WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND RELIED ON, COULD NOT,
WITH SUCH STEADINESS OF OPINION, AND SUCH TENDERNESS OF MANNER,
BE CONTINUALLY ADVISING HER IN VAIN.  SHE WAS PERSUADED TO BELIEVE
THE ENGAGEMENT A WRONG THING:  INDISCREET, IMPROPER, HARDLY CAPABLE
OF SUCCESS, AND NOT DESERVING IT.  BUT IT WAS NOT A MERELY SELFISH CAUTION,
UNDER WHICH SHE ACTED, IN PUTTING AN END TO IT.  HAD SHE NOT
IMAGINED HERSELF CONSULTING HIS GOOD, EVEN MORE THAN HER OWN,
SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM UP.  THE BELIEF OF BEING PRUDENT,
AND SELF-DENYING, PRINCIPALLY FOR HIS ADVANTAGE, WAS HER CHIEF CONSOLATION,
UNDER THE MISERY OF A PARTING, A FINAL PARTING; AND EVERY CONSOLATION
WAS REQUIRED, FOR SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER ALL THE ADDITIONAL PAIN OF OPINIONS,
ON HIS SIDE, TOTALLY UNCONVINCED AND UNBENDING, AND OF HIS FEELING HIMSELF
ILL USED BY SO FORCED A RELINQUISHMENT.  HE HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY
IN CONSEQUENCE.

A FEW MONTHS HAD SEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE;
BUT NOT WITH A FEW MONTHS ENDED ANNE'S SHARE OF SUFFERING FROM IT.
HER ATTACHMENT AND REGRETS HAD, FOR A LONG TIME, CLOUDED EVERY
ENJOYMENT OF YOUTH, AND AN EARLY LOSS OF BLOOM AND SPIRITS
HAD BEEN THEIR LASTING EFFECT.

MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS WERE GONE SINCE THIS LITTLE HISTORY
OF SORROWFUL INTEREST HAD REACHED ITS CLOSE; AND TIME HAD
SOFTENED DOWN MUCH, PERHAPS NEARLY ALL OF PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HIM,
BUT SHE HAD BEEN TOO DEPENDENT ON TIME ALONE; NO AID HAD BEEN GIVEN
IN CHANGE OF PLACE (EXCEPT IN ONE VISIT TO BATH SOON AFTER THE RUPTURE),
OR IN ANY NOVELTY OR ENLARGEMENT OF SOCIETY.  NO ONE HAD EVER
COME WITHIN THE KELLYNCH CIRCLE, WHO COULD BEAR A COMPARISON WITH
FREDERICK WENTWORTH, AS HE STOOD IN HER MEMORY.  NO SECOND ATTACHMENT,
THE ONLY THOROUGHLY NATURAL, HAPPY, AND SUFFICIENT CURE,
AT HER TIME OF LIFE, HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO THE NICE TONE OF HER MIND,
THE FASTIDIOUSNESS OF HER TASTE, IN THE SMALL LIMITS OF THE SOCIETY
AROUND THEM.  SHE HAD BEEN SOLICITED, WHEN ABOUT TWO-AND-TWENTY,
TO CHANGE HER NAME, BY THE YOUNG MAN, WHO NOT LONG AFTERWARDS FOUND
A MORE WILLING MIND IN HER YOUNGER SISTER; AND LADY RUSSELL HAD
LAMENTED HER REFUSAL; FOR CHARLES MUSGROVE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A MAN,
WHOSE LANDED PROPERTY AND GENERAL IMPORTANCE WERE SECOND IN THAT COUNTRY,
ONLY TO SIR WALTER'S, AND OF GOOD CHARACTER AND APPEARANCE;
AND HOWEVER LADY RUSSELL MIGHT HAVE ASKED YET FOR SOMETHING MORE,
WHILE ANNE WAS NINETEEN, SHE WOULD HAVE REJOICED TO SEE HER AT TWENTY-TWO
SO RESPECTABLY REMOVED FROM THE PARTIALITIES AND INJUSTICE OF
HER FATHER'S HOUSE, AND SETTLED SO PERMANENTLY NEAR HERSELF.
BUT IN THIS CASE, ANNE HAD LEFT NOTHING FOR ADVICE TO DO;
AND THOUGH LADY RUSSELL, AS SATISFIED AS EVER WITH HER OWN DISCRETION,
NEVER WISHED THE PAST UNDONE, SHE BEGAN NOW TO HAVE THE ANXIETY
WHICH BORDERS ON HOPELESSNESS FOR ANNE'S BEING TEMPTED, BY SOME MAN
OF TALENTS AND INDEPENDENCE, TO ENTER A STATE FOR WHICH SHE HELD HER
TO BE PECULIARLY FITTED BY HER WARM AFFECTIONS AND DOMESTIC HABITS.

THEY KNEW NOT EACH OTHER'S OPINION, EITHER ITS CONSTANCY OR ITS CHANGE,
ON THE ONE LEADING POINT OF ANNE'S CONDUCT, FOR THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER
ALLUDED TO; BUT ANNE, AT SEVEN-AND-TWENTY, THOUGHT VERY DIFFERENTLY
FROM WHAT SHE HAD BEEN MADE TO THINK AT NINETEEN.  SHE DID NOT BLAME
LADY RUSSELL, SHE DID NOT BLAME HERSELF FOR HAVING BEEN GUIDED BY HER;
BUT SHE FELT THAT WERE ANY YOUNG PERSON, IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES,
TO APPLY TO HER FOR COUNSEL, THEY WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ANY OF SUCH
CERTAIN IMMEDIATE WRETCHEDNESS, SUCH UNCERTAIN FUTURE GOOD.
SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT UNDER EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF DISAPPROBATION AT HOME,
AND EVERY ANXIETY ATTENDING HIS PROFESSION, ALL THEIR PROBABLE FEARS,
DELAYS, AND DISAPPOINTMENTS, SHE SHOULD YET HAVE BEEN A HAPPIER WOMAN
IN MAINTAINING THE ENGAGEMENT, THAN SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SACRIFICE OF IT;
AND THIS, SHE FULLY BELIEVED, HAD THE USUAL SHARE, HAD EVEN MORE THAN
THE USUAL SHARE OF ALL SUCH SOLICITUDES AND SUSPENSE BEEN THEIRS,
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THEIR CASE, WHICH,
AS IT HAPPENED, WOULD HAVE BESTOWED EARLIER PROSPERITY THAN
COULD BE REASONABLY CALCULATED ON.  ALL HIS SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS,
ALL HIS CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED.  HIS GENIUS AND ARDOUR
HAD SEEMED TO FORESEE AND TO COMMAND HIS PROSPEROUS PATH.
HE HAD, VERY SOON AFTER THEIR ENGAGEMENT CEASED, GOT EMPLOY:
AND ALL THAT HE HAD TOLD HER WOULD FOLLOW, HAD TAKEN PLACE.
HE HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF, AND EARLY GAINED THE OTHER STEP IN RANK,
AND MUST NOW, BY SUCCESSIVE CAPTURES, HAVE MADE A HANDSOME FORTUNE.
SHE HAD ONLY NAVY LISTS AND NEWSPAPERS FOR HER AUTHORITY,
BUT SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS BEING RICH; AND, IN FAVOUR OF HIS CONSTANCY,
SHE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE HIM MARRIED.

HOW ELOQUENT COULD ANNE ELLIOT HAVE BEEN! HOW ELOQUENT, AT LEAST,
WERE HER WISHES ON THE SIDE OF EARLY WARM ATTACHMENT, AND A CHEERFUL
CONFIDENCE IN FUTURITY, AGAINST THAT OVER-ANXIOUS CAUTION WHICH
SEEMS TO INSULT EXERTION AND DISTRUST PROVIDENCE!  SHE HAD BEEN FORCED
INTO PRUDENCE IN HER YOUTH, SHE LEARNED ROMANCE AS SHE GREW OLDER:
THE NATURAL SEQUEL OF AN UNNATURAL BEGINNING.

WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, RECOLLECTIONS AND FEELINGS,
SHE COULD NOT HEAR THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S SISTER WAS LIKELY
TO LIVE AT KELLYNCH WITHOUT A REVIVAL OF FORMER PAIN; AND MANY A STROLL,
AND MANY A SIGH, WERE NECESSARY TO DISPEL THE AGITATION OF THE IDEA.
SHE OFTEN TOLD HERSELF IT WAS FOLLY, BEFORE SHE COULD HARDEN HER NERVES
SUFFICIENTLY TO FEEL THE CONTINUAL DISCUSSION OF THE CROFTS
AND THEIR BUSINESS NO EVIL.  SHE WAS ASSISTED, HOWEVER, BY THAT
PERFECT INDIFFERENCE AND APPARENT UNCONSCIOUSNESS, AMONG THE ONLY THREE
OF HER OWN FRIENDS IN THE SECRET OF THE PAST, WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO DENY
ANY RECOLLECTION OF IT.  SHE COULD DO JUSTICE TO THE SUPERIORITY
OF LADY RUSSELL'S MOTIVES IN THIS, OVER THOSE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH;
SHE COULD HONOUR ALL THE BETTER FEELINGS OF HER CALMNESS;
BUT THE GENERAL AIR OF OBLIVION AMONG THEM WAS HIGHLY IMPORTANT
FROM WHATEVER IT SPRUNG; AND IN THE EVENT OF ADMIRAL CROFT'S REALLY
TAKING KELLYNCH HALL, SHE REJOICED ANEW OVER THE CONVICTION WHICH
HAD ALWAYS BEEN MOST GRATEFUL TO HER, OF THE PAST BEING KNOWN TO
THOSE THREE ONLY AMONG HER CONNEXIONS, BY WHOM NO SYLLABLE,
SHE BELIEVED, WOULD EVER BE WHISPERED, AND IN THE TRUST THAT AMONG HIS,
THE BROTHER ONLY WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN RESIDING, HAD RECEIVED
ANY INFORMATION OF THEIR SHORT-LIVED ENGAGEMENT.  THAT BROTHER HAD BEEN
LONG REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY AND BEING A SENSIBLE MAN, AND, MOREOVER,
A SINGLE MAN AT THE TIME, SHE HAD A FOND DEPENDENCE ON NO HUMAN CREATURE'S
HAVING HEARD OF IT FROM HIM.

THE SISTER, MRS CROFT, HAD THEN BEEN OUT OF ENGLAND, ACCOMPANYING
HER HUSBAND ON A FOREIGN STATION, AND HER OWN SISTER, MARY,
HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL WHILE IT ALL OCCURRED; AND NEVER ADMITTED BY
THE PRIDE OF SOME, AND THE DELICACY OF OTHERS, TO THE SMALLEST KNOWLEDGE
OF IT AFTERWARDS.

WITH THESE SUPPORTS, SHE HOPED THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN HERSELF
AND THE CROFTS, WHICH, WITH LADY RUSSELL, STILL RESIDENT IN KELLYNCH,
AND MARY FIXED ONLY THREE MILES OFF, MUST BE ANTICIPATED,
NEED NOT INVOLVE ANY PARTICULAR AWKWARDNESS.



CHAPTER 5


ON THE MORNING APPOINTED FOR ADMIRAL AND MRS CROFT'S SEEING KELLYNCH HALL,
ANNE FOUND IT MOST NATURAL TO TAKE HER ALMOST DAILY WALK TO LADY RUSSELL'S,
AND KEEP OUT OF THE WAY TILL ALL WAS OVER; WHEN SHE FOUND IT MOST NATURAL
TO BE SORRY THAT SHE HAD MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING THEM.

THIS MEETING OF THE TWO PARTIES PROVED HIGHLY SATISFACTORY,
AND DECIDED THE WHOLE BUSINESS AT ONCE.  EACH LADY WAS PREVIOUSLY
WELL DISPOSED FOR AN AGREEMENT, AND SAW NOTHING, THEREFORE,
BUT GOOD MANNERS IN THE OTHER; AND WITH REGARD TO THE GENTLEMEN,
THERE WAS SUCH AN HEARTY GOOD HUMOUR, SUCH AN OPEN, TRUSTING LIBERALITY
ON THE ADMIRAL'S SIDE, AS COULD NOT BUT INFLUENCE SIR WALTER,
WHO HAD BESIDES BEEN FLATTERED INTO HIS VERY BEST AND MOST POLISHED
BEHAVIOUR BY MR SHEPHERD'S ASSURANCES OF HIS BEING KNOWN, BY REPORT,
TO THE ADMIRAL, AS A MODEL OF GOOD BREEDING.

THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS, AND FURNITURE, WERE APPROVED, THE CROFTS
WERE APPROVED, TERMS, TIME, EVERY THING, AND EVERY BODY, WAS RIGHT;
AND MR SHEPHERD'S CLERKS WERE SET TO WORK, WITHOUT THERE HAVING BEEN
A SINGLE PRELIMINARY DIFFERENCE TO MODIFY OF ALL THAT
"THIS INDENTURE SHEWETH."

SIR WALTER, WITHOUT HESITATION, DECLARED THE ADMIRAL TO BE
THE BEST-LOOKING SAILOR HE HAD EVER MET WITH, AND WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY,
THAT IF HIS OWN MAN MIGHT HAVE HAD THE ARRANGING OF HIS HAIR,
HE SHOULD NOT BE ASHAMED OF BEING SEEN WITH HIM ANY WHERE;
AND THE ADMIRAL, WITH SYMPATHETIC CORDIALITY, OBSERVED TO HIS WIFE
AS THEY DROVE BACK THROUGH THE PARK, "I THOUGHT WE SHOULD SOON
COME TO A DEAL, MY DEAR, IN SPITE OF WHAT THEY TOLD US AT TAUNTON.
THE BARONET WILL NEVER SET THE THAMES ON FIRE, BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE
NO HARM IN HIM."  RECIPROCAL COMPLIMENTS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
ESTEEMED ABOUT EQUAL.

THE CROFTS WERE TO HAVE POSSESSION AT MICHAELMAS; AND AS SIR WALTER
PROPOSED REMOVING TO BATH IN THE COURSE OF THE PRECEDING MONTH,
THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST IN MAKING EVERY DEPENDENT ARRANGEMENT.

LADY RUSSELL, CONVINCED THAT ANNE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE OF ANY USE,
OR ANY IMPORTANCE, IN THE CHOICE OF THE HOUSE WHICH THEY WERE
GOING TO SECURE, WAS VERY UNWILLING TO HAVE HER HURRIED AWAY SO SOON,
AND WANTED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO STAY BEHIND TILL SHE MIGHT
CONVEY HER TO BATH HERSELF AFTER CHRISTMAS; BUT HAVING ENGAGEMENTS
OF HER OWN WHICH MUST TAKE HER FROM KELLYNCH FOR SEVERAL WEEKS,
SHE WAS UNABLE TO GIVE THE FULL INVITATION SHE WISHED, AND ANNE
THOUGH DREADING THE POSSIBLE HEATS OF SEPTEMBER IN ALL THE WHITE GLARE
OF BATH, AND GRIEVING TO FOREGO ALL THE INFLUENCE SO SWEET AND SO SAD
OF THE AUTUMNAL MONTHS IN THE COUNTRY, DID NOT THINK THAT,
EVERYTHING CONSIDERED, SHE WISHED TO REMAIN.  IT WOULD BE MOST RIGHT,
AND MOST WISE, AND, THEREFORE MUST INVOLVE LEAST SUFFERING
TO GO WITH THE OTHERS.

SOMETHING OCCURRED, HOWEVER, TO GIVE HER A DIFFERENT DUTY.
MARY, OFTEN A LITTLE UNWELL, AND ALWAYS THINKING A GREAT DEAL
OF HER OWN COMPLAINTS, AND ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF CLAIMING ANNE
WHEN ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER, WAS INDISPOSED; AND FORESEEING
THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE A DAY'S HEALTH ALL THE AUTUMN, ENTREATED,
OR RATHER REQUIRED HER, FOR IT WAS HARDLY ENTREATY, TO COME TO
UPPERCROSS COTTAGE, AND BEAR HER COMPANY AS LONG AS SHE SHOULD WANT HER,
INSTEAD OF GOING TO BATH.

"I CANNOT POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT ANNE," WAS MARY'S REASONING;
AND ELIZABETH'S REPLY WAS, "THEN I AM SURE ANNE HAD BETTER STAY,
FOR NOBODY WILL WANT HER IN BATH."

TO BE CLAIMED AS A GOOD, THOUGH IN AN IMPROPER STYLE, IS AT LEAST
BETTER THAN BEING REJECTED AS NO GOOD AT ALL; AND ANNE, GLAD TO
BE THOUGHT OF SOME USE, GLAD TO HAVE ANYTHING MARKED OUT AS A DUTY,
AND CERTAINLY NOT SORRY TO HAVE THE SCENE OF IT IN THE COUNTRY,
AND HER OWN DEAR COUNTRY, READILY AGREED TO STAY.

THIS INVITATION OF MARY'S REMOVED ALL LADY RUSSELL'S DIFFICULTIES,
AND IT WAS CONSEQUENTLY SOON SETTLED THAT ANNE SHOULD NOT GO TO BATH
TILL LADY RUSSELL TOOK HER, AND THAT ALL THE INTERVENING TIME
SHOULD BE DIVIDED BETWEEN UPPERCROSS COTTAGE AND KELLYNCH LODGE.

SO FAR ALL WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT; BUT LADY RUSSELL WAS ALMOST STARTLED
BY THE WRONG OF ONE PART OF THE KELLYNCH HALL PLAN, WHEN IT BURST ON HER,
WHICH WAS, MRS CLAY'S BEING ENGAGED TO GO TO BATH WITH SIR WALTER
AND ELIZABETH, AS A MOST IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE ASSISTANT TO THE LATTER
IN ALL THE BUSINESS BEFORE HER.  LADY RUSSELL WAS EXTREMELY SORRY
THAT SUCH A MEASURE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESORTED TO AT ALL, WONDERED,
GRIEVED, AND FEARED; AND THE AFFRONT IT CONTAINED TO ANNE,
IN MRS CLAY'S BEING OF SO MUCH USE, WHILE ANNE COULD BE OF NONE,
WAS A VERY SORE AGGRAVATION.

ANNE HERSELF WAS BECOME HARDENED TO SUCH AFFRONTS; BUT SHE FELT
THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENT QUITE AS KEENLY AS LADY RUSSELL.
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF QUIET OBSERVATION, AND A KNOWLEDGE,
WHICH SHE OFTEN WISHED LESS, OF HER FATHER'S CHARACTER, SHE WAS
SENSIBLE THAT RESULTS THE MOST SERIOUS TO HIS FAMILY FROM THE INTIMACY
WERE MORE THAN POSSIBLE.  SHE DID NOT IMAGINE THAT HER FATHER
HAD AT PRESENT AN IDEA OF THE KIND.  MRS CLAY HAD FRECKLES,
AND A PROJECTING TOOTH, AND A CLUMSY WRIST, WHICH HE WAS CONTINUALLY
MAKING SEVERE REMARKS UPON, IN HER ABSENCE; BUT SHE WAS YOUNG,
AND CERTAINLY ALTOGETHER WELL-LOOKING, AND POSSESSED, IN AN ACUTE MIND
AND ASSIDUOUS PLEASING MANNERS, INFINITELY MORE DANGEROUS ATTRACTIONS
THAN ANY MERELY PERSONAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN.  ANNE WAS SO IMPRESSED
BY THE DEGREE OF THEIR DANGER, THAT SHE COULD NOT EXCUSE HERSELF
FROM TRYING TO MAKE IT PERCEPTIBLE TO HER SISTER.  SHE HAD LITTLE HOPE
OF SUCCESS; BUT ELIZABETH, WHO IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A REVERSE WOULD BE
SO MUCH MORE TO BE PITIED THAN HERSELF, SHOULD NEVER, SHE THOUGHT,
HAVE REASON TO REPROACH HER FOR GIVING NO WARNING.

SHE SPOKE, AND SEEMED ONLY TO OFFEND.  ELIZABETH COULD NOT CONCEIVE
HOW SUCH AN ABSURD SUSPICION SHOULD OCCUR TO HER, AND INDIGNANTLY
ANSWERED FOR EACH PARTY'S PERFECTLY KNOWING THEIR SITUATION.

"MRS CLAY," SAID SHE, WARMLY, "NEVER FORGETS WHO SHE IS;
AND AS I AM RATHER BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER SENTIMENTS THAN YOU CAN BE,
I CAN ASSURE YOU, THAT UPON THE SUBJECT OF MARRIAGE THEY ARE
PARTICULARLY NICE, AND THAT SHE REPROBATES ALL INEQUALITY OF CONDITION
AND RANK MORE STRONGLY THAN MOST PEOPLE.  AND AS TO MY FATHER,
I REALLY SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE, WHO HAS KEPT HIMSELF SINGLE
SO LONG FOR OUR SAKES, NEED BE SUSPECTED NOW.  IF MRS CLAY WERE
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, I GRANT YOU, IT MIGHT BE WRONG TO HAVE HER
SO MUCH WITH ME; NOT THAT ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, I AM SURE,
WOULD INDUCE MY FATHER TO MAKE A DEGRADING MATCH, BUT HE MIGHT
BE RENDERED UNHAPPY.  BUT POOR MRS CLAY WHO, WITH ALL HER MERITS,
CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN RECKONED TOLERABLY PRETTY, I REALLY THINK POOR
MRS CLAY MAY BE STAYING HERE IN PERFECT SAFETY.  ONE WOULD IMAGINE
YOU HAD NEVER HEARD MY FATHER SPEAK OF HER PERSONAL MISFORTUNES,
THOUGH I KNOW YOU MUST FIFTY TIMES.  THAT TOOTH OF HER'S
AND THOSE FRECKLES.  FRECKLES DO NOT DISGUST ME SO VERY MUCH
AS THEY DO HIM.  I HAVE KNOWN A FACE NOT MATERIALLY DISFIGURED BY A FEW,
BUT HE ABOMINATES THEM.  YOU MUST HAVE HEARD HIM NOTICE
MRS CLAY'S FRECKLES."

"THERE IS HARDLY ANY PERSONAL DEFECT," REPLIED ANNE,
"WHICH AN AGREEABLE MANNER MIGHT NOT GRADUALLY RECONCILE ONE TO."

"I THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY," ANSWERED ELIZABETH, SHORTLY;
"AN AGREEABLE MANNER MAY SET OFF HANDSOME FEATURES, BUT CAN NEVER
ALTER PLAIN ONES.  HOWEVER, AT ANY RATE, AS I HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE
AT STAKE ON THIS POINT THAN ANYBODY ELSE CAN HAVE, I THINK IT
RATHER UNNECESSARY IN YOU TO BE ADVISING ME."

ANNE HAD DONE; GLAD THAT IT WAS OVER, AND NOT ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS
OF DOING GOOD.  ELIZABETH, THOUGH RESENTING THE SUSPICION,
MIGHT YET BE MADE OBSERVANT BY IT.

THE LAST OFFICE OF THE FOUR CARRIAGE-HORSES WAS TO DRAW SIR WALTER,
MISS ELLIOT, AND MRS CLAY TO BATH.  THE PARTY DROVE OFF IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS;
SIR WALTER PREPARED WITH CONDESCENDING BOWS FOR ALL THE AFFLICTED
TENANTRY AND COTTAGERS WHO MIGHT HAVE HAD A HINT TO SHOW THEMSELVES,
AND ANNE WALKED UP AT THE SAME TIME, IN A SORT OF DESOLATE TRANQUILLITY,
TO THE LODGE, WHERE SHE WAS TO SPEND THE FIRST WEEK.

HER FRIEND WAS NOT IN BETTER SPIRITS THAN HERSELF. LADY RUSSELL FELT THIS
BREAK-UP OF THE FAMILY EXCEEDINGLY.  THEIR RESPECTABILITY WAS
AS DEAR TO HER AS HER OWN, AND A DAILY INTERCOURSE HAD BECOME
PRECIOUS BY HABIT.  IT WAS PAINFUL TO LOOK UPON THEIR DESERTED GROUNDS,
AND STILL WORSE TO ANTICIPATE THE NEW HANDS THEY WERE TO FALL INTO;
AND TO ESCAPE THE SOLITARINESS AND THE MELANCHOLY OF SO ALTERED A VILLAGE,
AND BE OUT OF THE WAY WHEN ADMIRAL AND MRS CROFT FIRST ARRIVED,
SHE HAD DETERMINED TO MAKE HER OWN ABSENCE FROM HOME BEGIN
WHEN SHE MUST GIVE UP ANNE.  ACCORDINGLY THEIR REMOVAL WAS MADE TOGETHER,
AND ANNE WAS SET DOWN AT UPPERCROSS COTTAGE, IN THE FIRST STAGE
OF LADY RUSSELL'S JOURNEY.

UPPERCROSS WAS A MODERATE-SIZED VILLAGE, WHICH A FEW YEARS BACK
HAD BEEN COMPLETELY IN THE OLD ENGLISH STYLE, CONTAINING ONLY
TWO HOUSES SUPERIOR IN APPEARANCE TO THOSE OF THE YEOMEN AND LABOURERS;
THE MANSION OF THE SQUIRE, WITH ITS HIGH WALLS, GREAT GATES, AND OLD TREES,
SUBSTANTIAL AND UNMODERNIZED, AND THE COMPACT, TIGHT PARSONAGE,
ENCLOSED IN ITS OWN NEAT GARDEN, WITH A VINE AND A PEAR-TREE
TRAINED ROUND ITS CASEMENTS; BUT UPON THE MARRIAGE OF THE YOUNG 'SQUIRE,
IT HAD RECEIVED THE IMPROVEMENT OF A FARM-HOUSE ELEVATED INTO A COTTAGE,
FOR HIS RESIDENCE, AND UPPERCROSS COTTAGE, WITH ITS VERANDA,
FRENCH WINDOWS, AND OTHER PRETTINESS, WAS QUITE AS LIKELY TO CATCH
THE TRAVELLER'S EYE AS THE MORE CONSISTENT AND CONSIDERABLE ASPECT
AND PREMISES OF THE GREAT HOUSE, ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FARTHER ON.

HERE ANNE HAD OFTEN BEEN STAYING.  SHE KNEW THE WAYS OF UPPERCROSS
AS WELL AS THOSE OF KELLYNCH.  THE TWO FAMILIES WERE SO CONTINUALLY MEETING,
SO MUCH IN THE HABIT OF RUNNING IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER'S HOUSE
AT ALL HOURS, THAT IT WAS RATHER A SURPRISE TO HER TO FIND MARY ALONE;
BUT BEING ALONE, HER BEING UNWELL AND OUT OF SPIRITS WAS ALMOST
A MATTER OF COURSE.  THOUGH BETTER ENDOWED THAN THE ELDER SISTER,
MARY HAD NOT ANNE'S UNDERSTANDING NOR TEMPER.  WHILE WELL, AND HAPPY,
AND PROPERLY ATTENDED TO, SHE HAD GREAT GOOD HUMOUR AND EXCELLENT SPIRITS;
BUT ANY INDISPOSITION SUNK HER COMPLETELY.  SHE HAD NO RESOURCES
FOR SOLITUDE; AND INHERITING A CONSIDERABLE SHARE OF THE ELLIOT
SELF-IMPORTANCE, WAS VERY PRONE TO ADD TO EVERY OTHER DISTRESS
THAT OF FANCYING HERSELF NEGLECTED AND ILL-USED.  IN PERSON, SHE WAS
INFERIOR TO BOTH SISTERS, AND HAD, EVEN IN HER BLOOM, ONLY REACHED
THE DIGNITY OF BEING "A FINE GIRL."  SHE WAS NOW LYING ON THE FADED SOFA
OF THE PRETTY LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM, THE ONCE ELEGANT FURNITURE OF WHICH
HAD BEEN GRADUALLY GROWING SHABBY, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FOUR SUMMERS
AND TWO CHILDREN; AND, ON ANNE'S APPEARING, GREETED HER WITH--

"SO, YOU ARE COME AT LAST!  I BEGAN TO THINK I SHOULD NEVER SEE YOU.
I AM SO ILL I CAN HARDLY SPEAK.  I HAVE NOT SEEN A CREATURE
THE WHOLE MORNING!"

"I AM SORRY TO FIND YOU UNWELL," REPLIED ANNE.  "YOU SENT ME
SUCH A GOOD ACCOUNT OF YOURSELF ON THURSDAY!"

"YES, I MADE THE BEST OF IT; I ALWAYS DO:  BUT I WAS VERY FAR FROM WELL
AT THE TIME; AND I DO NOT THINK I EVER WAS SO ILL IN MY LIFE
AS I HAVE BEEN ALL THIS MORNING:  VERY UNFIT TO BE LEFT ALONE, I AM SURE.
SUPPOSE I WERE TO BE SEIZED OF A SUDDEN IN SOME DREADFUL WAY,
AND NOT ABLE TO RING THE BELL!  SO, LADY RUSSELL WOULD NOT GET OUT.
I DO NOT THINK SHE HAS BEEN IN THIS HOUSE THREE TIMES THIS SUMMER."

ANNE SAID WHAT WAS PROPER, AND ENQUIRED AFTER HER HUSBAND.
"OH! CHARLES IS OUT SHOOTING.  I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE SEVEN O'CLOCK.
HE WOULD GO, THOUGH I TOLD HIM HOW ILL I WAS.  HE SAID HE SHOULD NOT
STAY OUT LONG; BUT HE HAS NEVER COME BACK, AND NOW IT IS ALMOST ONE.
I ASSURE YOU, I HAVE NOT SEEN A SOUL THIS WHOLE LONG MORNING."

"YOU HAVE HAD YOUR LITTLE BOYS WITH YOU?"

"YES, AS LONG AS I COULD BEAR THEIR NOISE; BUT THEY ARE SO UNMANAGEABLE
THAT THEY DO ME MORE HARM THAN GOOD.  LITTLE CHARLES DOES NOT MIND
A WORD I SAY, AND WALTER IS GROWING QUITE AS BAD."

"WELL, YOU WILL SOON BE BETTER NOW," REPLIED ANNE, CHEERFULLY.
"YOU KNOW I ALWAYS CURE YOU WHEN I COME.  HOW ARE YOUR NEIGHBOURS
AT THE GREAT HOUSE?"

"I CAN GIVE YOU NO ACCOUNT OF THEM.  I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE OF THEM TO-DAY,
EXCEPT MR MUSGROVE, WHO JUST STOPPED AND SPOKE THROUGH THE WINDOW,
BUT WITHOUT GETTING OFF HIS HORSE; AND THOUGH I TOLD HIM HOW ILL I WAS,
NOT ONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN NEAR ME.  IT DID NOT HAPPEN TO SUIT
THE MISS MUSGROVES, I SUPPOSE, AND THEY NEVER PUT THEMSELVES
OUT OF THEIR WAY."

"YOU WILL SEE THEM YET, PERHAPS, BEFORE THE MORNING IS GONE.
IT IS EARLY."

"I NEVER WANT THEM, I ASSURE YOU.  THEY TALK AND LAUGH A GREAT DEAL
TOO MUCH FOR ME.  OH! ANNE, I AM SO VERY UNWELL!  IT WAS QUITE UNKIND
OF YOU NOT TO COME ON THURSDAY."

"MY DEAR MARY, RECOLLECT WHAT A COMFORTABLE ACCOUNT YOU SENT ME OF YOURSELF!
YOU WROTE IN THE CHEERFULLEST MANNER, AND SAID YOU WERE PERFECTLY WELL,
AND IN NO HURRY FOR ME; AND THAT BEING THE CASE, YOU MUST BE AWARE
THAT MY WISH WOULD BE TO REMAIN WITH LADY RUSSELL TO THE LAST:
AND BESIDES WHAT I FELT ON HER ACCOUNT, I HAVE REALLY BEEN SO BUSY,
HAVE HAD SO MUCH TO DO, THAT I COULD NOT VERY CONVENIENTLY HAVE
LEFT KELLYNCH SOONER."

"DEAR ME! WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO?"

"A GREAT MANY THINGS, I ASSURE YOU.  MORE THAN I CAN RECOLLECT
IN A MOMENT; BUT I CAN TELL YOU SOME.  I HAVE BEEN MAKING
A DUPLICATE OF THE CATALOGUE OF MY FATHER'S BOOKS AND PICTURES.
I HAVE BEEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE GARDEN WITH MACKENZIE,
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, AND MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND, WHICH OF ELIZABETH'S PLANTS
ARE FOR LADY RUSSELL.  I HAVE HAD ALL MY OWN LITTLE CONCERNS
TO ARRANGE, BOOKS AND MUSIC TO DIVIDE, AND ALL MY TRUNKS TO REPACK,
FROM NOT HAVING UNDERSTOOD IN TIME WHAT WAS INTENDED AS TO THE WAGGONS:
AND ONE THING I HAVE HAD TO DO, MARY, OF A MORE TRYING NATURE:
GOING TO ALMOST EVERY HOUSE IN THE PARISH, AS A SORT OF TAKE-LEAVE.
I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WISHED IT.  BUT ALL THESE THINGS TOOK UP
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME."

"OH! WELL!" AND AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE, "BUT YOU HAVE NEVER ASKED ME
ONE WORD ABOUT OUR DINNER AT THE POOLES YESTERDAY."

"DID YOU GO THEN?  I HAVE MADE NO ENQUIRIES, BECAUSE I CONCLUDED
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE PARTY."

"OH YES! I WENT.  I WAS VERY WELL YESTERDAY; NOTHING AT ALL
THE MATTER WITH ME TILL THIS MORNING.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE
IF I HAD NOT GONE."

"I AM VERY GLAD YOU WERE WELL ENOUGH, AND I HOPE YOU HAD A PLEASANT PARTY."

"NOTHING REMARKABLE.  ONE ALWAYS KNOWS BEFOREHAND WHAT THE DINNER WILL BE,
AND WHO WILL BE THERE; AND IT IS SO VERY UNCOMFORTABLE NOT HAVING
A CARRIAGE OF ONE'S OWN.  MR AND MRS MUSGROVE TOOK ME, AND WE WERE
SO CROWDED!  THEY ARE BOTH SO VERY LARGE, AND TAKE UP SO MUCH ROOM;
AND MR MUSGROVE ALWAYS SITS FORWARD.  SO, THERE WAS I, CROWDED INTO
THE BACK SEAT WITH HENRIETTA AND LOUISE; AND I THINK IT VERY LIKELY
THAT MY ILLNESS TO-DAY MAY BE OWING TO IT."

A LITTLE FURTHER PERSEVERANCE IN PATIENCE AND FORCED CHEERFULNESS
ON ANNE'S SIDE PRODUCED NEARLY A CURE ON MARY'S.  SHE COULD SOON
SIT UPRIGHT ON THE SOFA, AND BEGAN TO HOPE SHE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO LEAVE IT BY DINNER-TIME.  THEN, FORGETTING TO THINK OF IT,
SHE WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM, BEAUTIFYING A NOSEGAY;
THEN, SHE ATE HER COLD MEAT; AND THEN SHE WAS WELL ENOUGH
TO PROPOSE A LITTLE WALK.

"WHERE SHALL WE GO?" SAID SHE, WHEN THEY WERE READY.  "I SUPPOSE
YOU WILL NOT LIKE TO CALL AT THE GREAT HOUSE BEFORE THEY HAVE
BEEN TO SEE YOU?"

"I HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST OBJECTION ON THAT ACCOUNT," REPLIED ANNE.
"I SHOULD NEVER THINK OF STANDING ON SUCH CEREMONY WITH PEOPLE I KNOW
SO WELL AS MRS AND THE MISS MUSGROVES."

"OH! BUT THEY OUGHT TO CALL UPON YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
THEY OUGHT TO FEEL WHAT IS DUE TO YOU AS MY SISTER.  HOWEVER,
WE MAY AS WELL GO AND SIT WITH THEM A LITTLE  WHILE, AND WHEN WE
HAVE THAT OVER, WE CAN ENJOY OUR WALK."

ANNE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT SUCH A STYLE OF INTERCOURSE HIGHLY IMPRUDENT;
BUT SHE HAD CEASED TO ENDEAVOUR TO CHECK IT, FROM BELIEVING THAT,
THOUGH THERE WERE ON EACH SIDE CONTINUAL SUBJECTS OF OFFENCE,
NEITHER FAMILY COULD NOW DO WITHOUT IT.  TO THE GREAT HOUSE ACCORDINGLY
THEY WENT, TO SIT THE FULL HALF HOUR IN THE OLD-FASHIONED SQUARE PARLOUR,
WITH A SMALL CARPET AND SHINING FLOOR, TO WHICH THE PRESENT
DAUGHTERS OF THE HOUSE WERE GRADUALLY GIVING THE PROPER AIR OF CONFUSION
BY A GRAND PIANO-FORTE AND A HARP, FLOWER-STANDS AND LITTLE TABLES
PLACED IN EVERY DIRECTION.  OH! COULD THE ORIGINALS OF THE PORTRAITS
AGAINST THE WAINSCOT, COULD THE GENTLEMEN IN BROWN VELVET AND
THE LADIES IN BLUE SATIN HAVE SEEN WHAT WAS GOING ON, HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS
OF SUCH AN OVERTHROW OF ALL ORDER AND NEATNESS!  THE PORTRAITS THEMSELVES
SEEMED TO BE STARING IN ASTONISHMENT.

THE MUSGROVES, LIKE THEIR HOUSES, WERE IN A STATE OF ALTERATION,
PERHAPS OF IMPROVEMENT.  THE FATHER AND MOTHER WERE IN THE OLD
ENGLISH STYLE, AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE NEW.  MR AND MRS MUSGROVE
WERE A VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE; FRIENDLY AND HOSPITABLE,
NOT MUCH EDUCATED, AND NOT AT ALL ELEGANT.  THEIR CHILDREN HAD
MORE MODERN MINDS AND MANNERS.  THERE WAS A NUMEROUS FAMILY;
BUT THE ONLY TWO GROWN UP, EXCEPTING CHARLES, WERE HENRIETTA AND LOUISA,
YOUNG LADIES OF NINETEEN AND TWENTY, WHO HAD BROUGHT FROM SCHOOL AT EXETER
ALL THE USUAL STOCK OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND WERE NOW LIKE THOUSANDS
OF OTHER YOUNG LADIES, LIVING TO BE FASHIONABLE, HAPPY, AND MERRY.
THEIR DRESS HAD EVERY ADVANTAGE, THEIR FACES WERE RATHER PRETTY,
THEIR SPIRITS EXTREMELY GOOD, THEIR MANNER UNEMBARRASSED AND PLEASANT;
THEY WERE OF CONSEQUENCE AT HOME, AND FAVOURITES ABROAD.
ANNE ALWAYS CONTEMPLATED THEM AS SOME OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES
OF HER ACQUAINTANCE; BUT STILL, SAVED AS WE ALL ARE, BY SOME
COMFORTABLE FEELING OF SUPERIORITY FROM WISHING FOR THE POSSIBILITY
OF EXCHANGE, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN UP HER OWN MORE ELEGANT
AND CULTIVATED MIND FOR ALL THEIR ENJOYMENTS; AND ENVIED THEM NOTHING
BUT THAT SEEMINGLY PERFECT GOOD UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT TOGETHER,
THAT GOOD-HUMOURED MUTUAL AFFECTION, OF WHICH SHE HAD KNOWN
SO LITTLE HERSELF WITH EITHER OF HER SISTERS.

THEY WERE RECEIVED WITH GREAT CORDIALITY.  NOTHING SEEMED AMISS
ON THE SIDE OF THE GREAT HOUSE FAMILY, WHICH WAS GENERALLY,
AS ANNE VERY WELL KNEW, THE LEAST TO BLAME.  THE HALF HOUR WAS
CHATTED AWAY PLEASANTLY ENOUGH; AND SHE WAS NOT AT ALL SURPRISED
AT THE END OF IT, TO HAVE THEIR WALKING PARTY JOINED BY BOTH
THE MISS MUSGROVES, AT MARY'S PARTICULAR INVITATION.



CHAPTER 6


ANNE HAD NOT WANTED THIS VISIT TO UPPERCROSS, TO LEARN THAT A REMOVAL
FROM ONE SET OF PEOPLE TO ANOTHER, THOUGH AT A DISTANCE OF ONLY THREE MILES,
WILL OFTEN INCLUDE A TOTAL CHANGE OF CONVERSATION, OPINION, AND IDEA.
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN STAYING THERE BEFORE, WITHOUT BEING STRUCK BY IT,
OR WITHOUT WISHING THAT OTHER ELLIOTS COULD HAVE HER ADVANTAGE
IN SEEING HOW UNKNOWN, OR UNCONSIDERED THERE, WERE THE AFFAIRS
WHICH AT KELLYNCH HALL WERE TREATED AS OF SUCH GENERAL PUBLICITY
AND PERVADING INTEREST; YET, WITH ALL THIS EXPERIENCE, SHE BELIEVED
SHE MUST NOW SUBMIT TO FEEL THAT ANOTHER LESSON, IN THE ART OF KNOWING
OUR OWN NOTHINGNESS BEYOND OUR OWN CIRCLE, WAS BECOME NECESSARY FOR HER;
FOR CERTAINLY, COMING AS SHE DID, WITH A HEART FULL OF THE SUBJECT
WHICH HAD BEEN COMPLETELY OCCUPYING BOTH HOUSES IN KELLYNCH FOR MANY WEEKS,
SHE HAD EXPECTED RATHER MORE CURIOSITY AND SYMPATHY THAN SHE FOUND
IN THE SEPARATE BUT VERY SIMILAR REMARK OF MR AND MRS MUSGROVE:
"SO, MISS ANNE, SIR WALTER AND YOUR SISTER ARE GONE; AND WHAT PART OF BATH
DO YOU THINK THEY WILL SETTLE IN?" AND THIS, WITHOUT MUCH
WAITING FOR AN ANSWER; OR IN THE YOUNG LADIES' ADDITION OF,
"I HOPE WE SHALL BE IN BATH IN THE WINTER; BUT REMEMBER, PAPA,
IF WE DO GO, WE MUST BE IN A GOOD SITUATION:  NONE OF YOUR
QUEEN SQUARES FOR US!" OR IN THE ANXIOUS SUPPLEMENT FROM MARY, OF--
"UPON MY WORD, I SHALL BE PRETTY WELL OFF, WHEN YOU ARE ALL GONE AWAY
TO BE HAPPY AT BATH!"

SHE COULD ONLY RESOLVE TO AVOID SUCH SELF-DELUSION IN FUTURE,
AND THINK WITH HEIGHTENED GRATITUDE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY BLESSING
OF HAVING ONE SUCH TRULY SYMPATHISING FRIEND AS LADY RUSSELL.

THE MR MUSGROVES HAD THEIR OWN GAME TO GUARD, AND TO DESTROY,
THEIR OWN HORSES, DOGS, AND NEWSPAPERS TO ENGAGE THEM, AND THE FEMALES
WERE FULLY OCCUPIED IN ALL THE OTHER COMMON SUBJECTS OF HOUSEKEEPING,
NEIGHBOURS, DRESS, DANCING, AND MUSIC.  SHE ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO BE
VERY FITTING, THAT EVERY LITTLE SOCIAL COMMONWEALTH SHOULD DICTATE
ITS OWN MATTERS OF DISCOURSE; AND HOPED, ERE LONG, TO BECOME
A NOT UNWORTHY MEMBER OF THE ONE SHE WAS NOW TRANSPLANTED INTO.
WITH THE PROSPECT OF SPENDING AT LEAST TWO MONTHS AT UPPERCROSS,
IT WAS HIGHLY INCUMBENT ON HER TO CLOTHE HER IMAGINATION, HER MEMORY,
AND ALL HER IDEAS IN AS MUCH OF UPPERCROSS AS POSSIBLE.

SHE HAD NO DREAD OF THESE TWO MONTHS.  MARY WAS NOT SO REPULSIVE
AND UNSISTERLY AS ELIZABETH, NOR SO INACCESSIBLE TO ALL INFLUENCE OF HERS;
NEITHER WAS THERE ANYTHING AMONG THE OTHER COMPONENT PARTS
OF THE COTTAGE INIMICAL TO COMFORT.  SHE WAS ALWAYS ON FRIENDLY TERMS
WITH HER BROTHER-IN-LAW; AND IN THE CHILDREN, WHO LOVED HER NEARLY AS WELL,
AND RESPECTED HER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THEIR MOTHER, SHE HAD
AN OBJECT OF INTEREST, AMUSEMENT, AND WHOLESOME EXERTION.

CHARLES MUSGROVE WAS CIVIL AND AGREEABLE; IN SENSE AND TEMPER HE WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY SUPERIOR TO HIS WIFE, BUT NOT OF POWERS, OR CONVERSATION,
OR GRACE, TO MAKE THE PAST, AS THEY WERE CONNECTED TOGETHER,
AT ALL A DANGEROUS CONTEMPLATION; THOUGH, AT THE SAME TIME,
ANNE COULD BELIEVE, WITH LADY RUSSELL, THAT A MORE EQUAL MATCH
MIGHT HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED HIM; AND THAT A WOMAN OF REAL UNDERSTANDING
MIGHT HAVE GIVEN MORE CONSEQUENCE TO HIS CHARACTER, AND MORE USEFULNESS,
RATIONALITY, AND ELEGANCE TO HIS HABITS AND PURSUITS.  AS IT WAS,
HE DID NOTHING WITH MUCH ZEAL, BUT SPORT; AND HIS TIME WAS OTHERWISE
TRIFLED AWAY, WITHOUT BENEFIT FROM BOOKS OR ANYTHING ELSE.
HE HAD VERY GOOD SPIRITS, WHICH NEVER SEEMED MUCH AFFECTED BY
HIS WIFE'S OCCASIONAL LOWNESS, BORE WITH HER UNREASONABLENESS
SOMETIMES TO ANNE'S ADMIRATION, AND UPON THE WHOLE, THOUGH THERE WAS
VERY OFTEN A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT (IN WHICH SHE HAD SOMETIMES MORE SHARE
THAN SHE WISHED, BEING APPEALED TO BY BOTH PARTIES), THEY MIGHT PASS
FOR A HAPPY COUPLE.  THEY WERE ALWAYS PERFECTLY AGREED IN THE WANT
OF MORE MONEY, AND A STRONG INCLINATION FOR A HANDSOME PRESENT
FROM HIS FATHER; BUT HERE, AS ON MOST TOPICS, HE HAD THE SUPERIORITY,
FOR WHILE MARY THOUGHT IT A GREAT SHAME THAT SUCH A PRESENT WAS NOT MADE,
HE ALWAYS CONTENDED FOR HIS FATHER'S HAVING MANY OTHER USES FOR HIS MONEY,
AND A RIGHT TO SPEND IT AS HE LIKED.

AS TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR CHILDREN, HIS THEORY WAS MUCH BETTER
THAN HIS WIFE'S, AND HIS PRACTICE NOT SO BAD.  "I COULD MANAGE THEM
VERY WELL, IF IT WERE NOT FOR MARY'S INTERFERENCE," WAS WHAT
ANNE OFTEN HEARD HIM SAY, AND HAD A GOOD DEAL OF FAITH IN;
BUT WHEN LISTENING IN TURN TO MARY'S REPROACH OF "CHARLES SPOILS
THE CHILDREN SO THAT I CANNOT GET THEM INTO ANY ORDER," SHE NEVER HAD
THE SMALLEST TEMPTATION TO SAY, "VERY TRUE."

ONE OF THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER RESIDENCE THERE
WAS HER BEING TREATED WITH TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE BY ALL PARTIES,
AND BEING TOO MUCH IN THE SECRET OF THE COMPLAINTS OF EACH HOUSE.
KNOWN TO HAVE SOME INFLUENCE WITH HER SISTER, SHE WAS CONTINUALLY REQUESTED,
OR AT LEAST RECEIVING HINTS TO EXERT IT, BEYOND WHAT WAS PRACTICABLE.
"I WISH YOU COULD PERSUADE MARY NOT TO BE ALWAYS FANCYING HERSELF ILL,"
WAS CHARLES'S LANGUAGE; AND, IN AN UNHAPPY MOOD, THUS SPOKE MARY:
"I DO BELIEVE IF CHARLES WERE TO SEE ME DYING, HE WOULD NOT THINK
THERE WAS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH ME.  I AM SURE, ANNE, IF YOU WOULD,
YOU MIGHT PERSUADE HIM THAT I REALLY AM VERY ILL--A GREAT DEAL WORSE
THAN I EVER OWN."

MARY'S DECLARATION WAS, "I HATE SENDING THE CHILDREN TO THE GREAT HOUSE,
THOUGH THEIR GRANDMAMMA IS ALWAYS WANTING TO SEE THEM, FOR SHE HUMOURS
AND INDULGES THEM TO SUCH A DEGREE, AND GIVES THEM SO MUCH TRASH
AND SWEET THINGS, THAT THEY ARE SURE TO COME BACK SICK AND CROSS
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY."  AND MRS MUSGROVE TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
OF BEING ALONE WITH ANNE, TO SAY, "OH! MISS ANNE, I CANNOT HELP WISHING
MRS CHARLES HAD A LITTLE OF YOUR METHOD WITH THOSE CHILDREN.
THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT CREATURES WITH YOU!  BUT TO BE SURE,
IN GENERAL THEY ARE SO SPOILT!  IT IS A PITY YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR SISTER
IN THE WAY OF MANAGING THEM.  THEY ARE AS FINE HEALTHY CHILDREN
AS EVER WERE SEEN, POOR LITTLE DEARS! WITHOUT PARTIALITY;
BUT MRS CHARLES KNOWS NO MORE HOW THEY SHOULD BE TREATED--!
BLESS ME! HOW TROUBLESOME THEY ARE SOMETIMES.  I ASSURE YOU, MISS ANNE,
IT PREVENTS MY WISHING TO SEE THEM AT OUR HOUSE SO OFTEN AS
I OTHERWISE SHOULD.  I BELIEVE MRS CHARLES IS NOT QUITE PLEASED
WITH MY NOT INVITING THEM OFTENER; BUT YOU KNOW IT IS VERY BAD
TO HAVE CHILDREN WITH ONE THAT ONE IS OBLIGATED TO BE CHECKING
EVERY MOMENT; "DON'T DO THIS," AND "DON'T DO THAT;"  OR THAT ONE CAN
ONLY KEEP IN TOLERABLE ORDER BY MORE CAKE THAN IS GOOD FOR THEM."

SHE HAD THIS COMMUNICATION, MOREOVER, FROM MARY.  "MRS MUSGROVE THINKS
ALL HER SERVANTS SO STEADY, THAT IT WOULD BE HIGH TREASON
TO CALL IT IN QUESTION; BUT I AM SURE, WITHOUT EXAGGERATION,
THAT HER UPPER HOUSE-MAID AND LAUNDRY-MAID, INSTEAD OF BEING
IN THEIR BUSINESS, ARE GADDING ABOUT THE VILLAGE, ALL DAY LONG.
I MEET THEM WHEREVER I GO; AND I DECLARE, I NEVER GO TWICE INTO MY NURSERY
WITHOUT SEEING SOMETHING OF THEM.  IF JEMIMA WERE NOT THE TRUSTIEST,
STEADIEST CREATURE IN THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SPOIL HER;
FOR SHE TELLS ME, THEY ARE ALWAYS TEMPTING HER TO TAKE A WALK WITH THEM."
AND ON MRS MUSGROVE'S SIDE, IT WAS, "I MAKE A RULE OF NEVER INTERFERING
IN ANY OF MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S CONCERNS, FOR I KNOW IT WOULD NOT DO;
BUT I SHALL TELL YOU, MISS ANNE, BECAUSE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SET THINGS
TO RIGHTS, THAT I HAVE NO VERY GOOD OPINION OF MRS CHARLES'S NURSERY-MAID:
I HEAR STRANGE STORIES OF HER; SHE IS ALWAYS UPON THE GAD; AND FROM
MY OWN KNOWLEDGE, I CAN DECLARE, SHE IS SUCH A FINE-DRESSING LADY,
THAT SHE IS ENOUGH TO RUIN ANY SERVANTS SHE COMES NEAR.
MRS CHARLES QUITE SWEARS BY HER, I KNOW; BUT I JUST GIVE YOU THIS HINT,
THAT YOU MAY BE UPON THE WATCH; BECAUSE, IF YOU SEE ANYTHING AMISS,
YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MENTIONING IT."

AGAIN, IT WAS MARY'S COMPLAINT, THAT MRS MUSGROVE WAS VERY APT
NOT TO GIVE HER THE PRECEDENCE THAT WAS HER DUE, WHEN THEY DINED
AT THE GREAT HOUSE WITH OTHER FAMILIES; AND SHE DID NOT SEE ANY REASON
WHY SHE WAS TO BE CONSIDERED SO MUCH AT HOME AS TO LOSE HER PLACE.
AND ONE DAY WHEN ANNE WAS WALKING WITH ONLY THE MUSGROVES, ONE OF THEM
AFTER TALKING OF RANK, PEOPLE OF RANK, AND JEALOUSY OF RANK, SAID,
"I HAVE NO SCRUPLE OF OBSERVING TO YOU, HOW NONSENSICAL SOME PERSONS ARE
ABOUT THEIR PLACE, BECAUSE ALL THE WORLD KNOWS HOW EASY AND INDIFFERENT
YOU ARE ABOUT IT; BUT I WISH ANYBODY COULD GIVE MARY A HINT THAT
IT WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER IF SHE WERE NOT SO VERY TENACIOUS,
ESPECIALLY IF SHE WOULD NOT BE ALWAYS PUTTING HERSELF FORWARD TO TAKE
PLACE OF MAMMA.  NOBODY DOUBTS HER RIGHT TO HAVE PRECEDENCE OF MAMMA,
BUT IT WOULD BE MORE BECOMING IN HER NOT TO BE ALWAYS INSISTING ON IT.
IT IS NOT THAT MAMMA CARES ABOUT IT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD,
BUT I KNOW IT IS TAKEN NOTICE OF BY MANY PERSONS."

HOW WAS ANNE TO SET ALL THESE MATTERS TO RIGHTS?  SHE COULD DO LITTLE MORE
THAN LISTEN PATIENTLY, SOFTEN EVERY GRIEVANCE, AND EXCUSE EACH
TO THE OTHER; GIVE THEM ALL HINTS OF THE FORBEARANCE NECESSARY
BETWEEN SUCH NEAR NEIGHBOURS, AND MAKE THOSE HINTS BROADEST
WHICH WERE MEANT FOR HER SISTER'S BENEFIT.

IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS, HER VISIT BEGAN AND PROCEEDED VERY WELL.
HER OWN SPIRITS IMPROVED BY CHANGE OF PLACE AND SUBJECT,
BY BEING REMOVED THREE MILES FROM KELLYNCH; MARY'S AILMENTS LESSENED
BY HAVING A CONSTANT COMPANION, AND THEIR DAILY INTERCOURSE
WITH THE OTHER FAMILY, SINCE THERE WAS NEITHER SUPERIOR AFFECTION,
CONFIDENCE, NOR EMPLOYMENT IN THE COTTAGE, TO BE INTERRUPTED BY IT,
WAS RATHER AN ADVANTAGE.  IT WAS CERTAINLY CARRIED NEARLY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE,
FOR THEY MET EVERY MORNING, AND HARDLY EVER SPENT AN EVENING ASUNDER;
BUT SHE BELIEVED THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE SO WELL WITHOUT THE SIGHT
OF MR AND MRS MUSGROVE'S RESPECTABLE FORMS IN THE USUAL PLACES,
OR WITHOUT THE TALKING, LAUGHING, AND SINGING OF THEIR DAUGHTERS.

SHE PLAYED A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN EITHER OF THE MISS MUSGROVES,
BUT HAVING NO VOICE, NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE HARP, AND NO FOND PARENTS,
TO SIT BY AND FANCY THEMSELVES DELIGHTED, HER PERFORMANCE WAS
LITTLE THOUGHT OF, ONLY OUT OF CIVILITY, OR TO REFRESH THE OTHERS,
AS SHE WAS WELL AWARE.  SHE KNEW THAT WHEN SHE PLAYED SHE WAS
GIVING PLEASURE ONLY TO HERSELF; BUT THIS WAS NO NEW SENSATION.
EXCEPTING ONE SHORT PERIOD OF HER LIFE, SHE HAD NEVER, SINCE THE AGE
OF FOURTEEN, NEVER SINCE THE LOSS OF HER DEAR MOTHER, KNOWN THE HAPPINESS
OF BEING LISTENED TO, OR ENCOURAGED BY ANY JUST APPRECIATION OR REAL TASTE.
IN MUSIC SHE HAD BEEN ALWAYS USED TO FEEL ALONE IN THE WORLD;
AND MR AND MRS MUSGROVE'S FOND PARTIALITY FOR THEIR OWN DAUGHTERS'
PERFORMANCE, AND TOTAL INDIFFERENCE TO ANY OTHER PERSON'S,
GAVE HER MUCH MORE PLEASURE FOR THEIR SAKES, THAN MORTIFICATION
FOR HER OWN.

THE PARTY AT THE GREAT HOUSE WAS SOMETIMES INCREASED BY OTHER COMPANY.
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS NOT LARGE, BUT THE MUSGROVES WERE VISITED
BY EVERYBODY, AND HAD MORE DINNER-PARTIES, AND MORE CALLERS,
MORE VISITORS BY INVITATION AND BY CHANCE, THAN ANY OTHER FAMILY.
THERE WERE MORE COMPLETELY POPULAR.

THE GIRLS WERE WILD FOR DANCING; AND THE EVENINGS ENDED, OCCASIONALLY,
IN AN UNPREMEDITATED LITTLE BALL.  THERE WAS A FAMILY OF COUSINS
WITHIN A WALK OF UPPERCROSS, IN LESS AFFLUENT CIRCUMSTANCES,
WHO DEPENDED ON THE MUSGROVES FOR ALL THEIR PLEASURES:  THEY WOULD COME
AT ANY TIME, AND HELP PLAY AT ANYTHING, OR DANCE ANYWHERE; AND ANNE,
VERY MUCH PREFERRING THE OFFICE OF MUSICIAN TO A MORE ACTIVE POST,
PLAYED COUNTRY DANCES TO THEM BY THE HOUR TOGETHER; A KINDNESS WHICH
ALWAYS RECOMMENDED HER MUSICAL POWERS TO THE NOTICE OF MR AND MRS MUSGROVE
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, AND OFTEN DREW THIS COMPLIMENT;--
"WELL DONE, MISS ANNE! VERY WELL DONE INDEED!  LORD BLESS ME!
HOW THOSE LITTLE FINGERS OF YOURS FLY ABOUT!"

SO PASSED THE FIRST THREE WEEKS.  MICHAELMAS CAME; AND NOW ANNE'S HEART
MUST BE IN KELLYNCH AGAIN.  A BELOVED HOME MADE OVER TO OTHERS;
ALL THE PRECIOUS ROOMS AND FURNITURE, GROVES, AND PROSPECTS,
BEGINNING TO OWN OTHER EYES AND OTHER LIMBS!  SHE COULD NOT
THINK OF MUCH ELSE ON THE 29TH OF SEPTEMBER; AND SHE HAD THIS
SYMPATHETIC TOUCH IN THE EVENING FROM MARY, WHO, ON HAVING OCCASION
TO NOTE DOWN THE DAY OF THE MONTH, EXCLAIMED, "DEAR ME, IS NOT THIS
THE DAY THE CROFTS WERE TO COME TO KELLYNCH?  I AM GLAD I DID NOT
THINK OF IT BEFORE.  HOW LOW IT MAKES ME!"

THE CROFTS TOOK POSSESSION WITH TRUE NAVAL ALERTNESS, AND WERE
TO BE VISITED.  MARY DEPLORED THE NECESSITY FOR HERSELF.
"NOBODY KNEW HOW MUCH SHE SHOULD SUFFER.  SHE SHOULD PUT IT OFF
AS LONG AS SHE COULD;" BUT WAS NOT EASY TILL SHE HAD TALKED CHARLES
INTO DRIVING HER OVER ON AN EARLY DAY, AND WAS IN A VERY ANIMATED,
COMFORTABLE STATE OF IMAGINARY AGITATION, WHEN SHE CAME BACK.
ANNE HAD VERY SINCERELY REJOICED IN THERE BEING NO MEANS OF HER GOING.
SHE WISHED, HOWEVER TO SEE THE CROFTS, AND WAS GLAD TO BE WITHIN
WHEN THE VISIT WAS RETURNED.  THEY CAME:  THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE
WAS NOT AT HOME, BUT THE TWO SISTERS WERE TOGETHER; AND AS IT CHANCED
THAT MRS CROFT FELL TO THE SHARE OF ANNE, WHILE THE ADMIRAL SAT BY MARY,
AND MADE HIMSELF VERY AGREEABLE BY HIS GOOD-HUMOURED NOTICE
OF HER LITTLE BOYS, SHE WAS WELL ABLE TO WATCH FOR A LIKENESS,
AND IF IT FAILED HER IN THE FEATURES, TO CATCH IT IN THE VOICE,
OR IN THE TURN OF SENTIMENT AND EXPRESSION.

MRS CROFT, THOUGH NEITHER TALL NOR FAT, HAD A SQUARENESS,
UPRIGHTNESS, AND VIGOUR OF FORM, WHICH GAVE IMPORTANCE TO HER PERSON.
SHE HAD BRIGHT DARK EYES, GOOD TEETH, AND ALTOGETHER AN AGREEABLE FACE;
THOUGH HER REDDENED AND WEATHER-BEATEN COMPLEXION, THE CONSEQUENCE
OF HER HAVING BEEN ALMOST AS MUCH AT SEA AS HER HUSBAND, MADE HER SEEM TO
HAVE LIVED SOME YEARS LONGER IN THE WORLD THAN HER REAL EIGHT-AND-THIRTY.
HER MANNERS WERE OPEN, EASY, AND DECIDED, LIKE ONE WHO HAD
NO DISTRUST OF HERSELF, AND NO DOUBTS OF WHAT TO DO; WITHOUT ANY
APPROACH TO COARSENESS, HOWEVER, OR ANY WANT OF GOOD HUMOUR.
ANNE GAVE HER CREDIT, INDEED, FOR FEELINGS OF GREAT CONSIDERATION
TOWARDS HERSELF, IN ALL THAT RELATED TO KELLYNCH, AND IT PLEASED HER:
ESPECIALLY, AS SHE HAD SATISFIED HERSELF IN THE VERY FIRST HALF MINUTE,
IN THE INSTANT EVEN OF INTRODUCTION, THAT THERE WAS NOT THE SMALLEST
SYMPTOM OF ANY KNOWLEDGE OR SUSPICION ON MRS CROFT'S SIDE, TO GIVE A BIAS
OF ANY SORT.  SHE WAS QUITE EASY ON THAT HEAD, AND CONSEQUENTLY
FULL OF STRENGTH AND COURAGE, TILL FOR A MOMENT ELECTRIFIED BY
MRS CROFT'S SUDDENLY SAYING,--

"IT WAS YOU, AND NOT YOUR SISTER, I FIND, THAT MY BROTHER HAD
THE PLEASURE OF BEING ACQUAINTED WITH, WHEN HE WAS IN THIS COUNTRY."

ANNE HOPED SHE HAD OUTLIVED THE AGE OF BLUSHING; BUT THE AGE OF EMOTION
SHE CERTAINLY HAD NOT.

"PERHAPS YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD THAT HE IS MARRIED?" ADDED MRS CROFT.

SHE COULD NOW ANSWER AS SHE OUGHT; AND WAS HAPPY TO FEEL,
WHEN MRS CROFT'S NEXT WORDS EXPLAINED IT TO BE MR WENTWORTH
OF WHOM SHE SPOKE, THAT SHE HAD SAID NOTHING WHICH MIGHT NOT DO
FOR EITHER BROTHER. SHE IMMEDIATELY FELT HOW REASONABLE IT WAS,
THAT MRS CROFT SHOULD BE THINKING AND SPEAKING OF EDWARD,
AND NOT OF FREDERICK; AND WITH SHAME AT HER OWN FORGETFULNESS
APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FORMER NEIGHBOUR'S
PRESENT STATE WITH PROPER INTEREST.

THE REST WAS ALL TRANQUILLITY; TILL, JUST AS THEY WERE MOVING,
SHE HEARD THE ADMIRAL SAY TO MARY--

"WE ARE EXPECTING A BROTHER OF MRS CROFT'S HERE SOON; I DARE SAY
YOU KNOW HIM BY NAME."

HE WAS CUT SHORT BY THE EAGER ATTACKS OF THE LITTLE BOYS,
CLINGING TO HIM LIKE AN OLD FRIEND, AND DECLARING HE SHOULD NOT GO;
AND BEING TOO MUCH ENGROSSED BY PROPOSALS OF CARRYING THEM AWAY
IN HIS COAT POCKETS, &C., TO HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT FOR FINISHING
OR RECOLLECTING WHAT HE HAD BEGUN, ANNE WAS LEFT TO PERSUADE HERSELF,
AS WELL AS SHE COULD, THAT THE SAME BROTHER MUST STILL BE IN QUESTION.
SHE COULD NOT, HOWEVER, REACH SUCH A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY,
AS NOT TO BE ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHETHER ANYTHING HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT
AT THE OTHER HOUSE, WHERE THE CROFTS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CALLING.

THE FOLKS OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TO SPEND THE EVENING OF THIS DAY
AT THE COTTAGE; AND IT BEING NOW TOO LATE IN THE YEAR FOR SUCH VISITS
TO BE MADE ON FOOT, THE COACH WAS BEGINNING TO BE LISTENED FOR,
WHEN THE YOUNGEST MISS MUSGROVE WALKED IN.  THAT SHE WAS COMING
TO APOLOGIZE, AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO SPEND THE EVENING BY THEMSELVES,
WAS THE FIRST BLACK IDEA; AND MARY WAS QUITE READY TO BE AFFRONTED,
WHEN LOUISA MADE ALL RIGHT BY SAYING, THAT SHE ONLY CAME ON FOOT,
TO LEAVE MORE ROOM FOR THE HARP, WHICH WAS BRINGING IN THE CARRIAGE.

"AND I WILL TELL YOU OUR REASON," SHE ADDED, "AND ALL ABOUT IT.
I AM COME ON TO GIVE YOU NOTICE, THAT PAPA AND MAMMA ARE
OUT OF SPIRITS THIS EVENING, ESPECIALLY MAMMA; SHE IS THINKING SO MUCH
OF POOR RICHARD!  AND WE AGREED IT WOULD BE BEST TO HAVE THE HARP,
FOR IT SEEMS TO AMUSE HER MORE THAN THE PIANO-FORTE.  I WILL TELL YOU
WHY SHE IS OUT OF SPIRITS.  WHEN THE CROFTS CALLED THIS MORNING,
(THEY CALLED HERE AFTERWARDS, DID NOT THEY?), THEY HAPPENED TO SAY,
THAT HER BROTHER, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IS JUST RETURNED TO ENGLAND,
OR PAID OFF, OR SOMETHING, AND IS COMING TO SEE THEM ALMOST DIRECTLY;
AND MOST UNLUCKILY IT CAME INTO MAMMA'S HEAD, WHEN THEY WERE GONE,
THAT WENTWORTH, OR SOMETHING VERY LIKE IT, WAS THE NAME OF
POOR RICHARD'S CAPTAIN AT ONE TIME; I DO NOT KNOW WHEN OR WHERE,
BUT A GREAT WHILE BEFORE HE DIED, POOR FELLOW!  AND UPON LOOKING OVER
HIS LETTERS AND THINGS, SHE FOUND IT WAS SO, AND IS PERFECTLY SURE
THAT THIS MUST BE THE VERY MAN, AND HER HEAD IS QUITE FULL OF IT,
AND OF POOR RICHARD!  SO WE MUST BE AS MERRY AS WE CAN, THAT SHE MAY NOT
BE DWELLING UPON SUCH GLOOMY THINGS."

THE REAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS PATHETIC PIECE OF FAMILY HISTORY WERE,
THAT THE MUSGROVES HAD HAD THE ILL FORTUNE OF A VERY TROUBLESOME,
HOPELESS SON; AND THE GOOD FORTUNE TO LOSE HIM BEFORE HE REACHED
HIS TWENTIETH YEAR; THAT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO SEA BECAUSE HE WAS STUPID
AND UNMANAGEABLE ON SHORE; THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE CARED FOR
AT ANY TIME BY HIS FAMILY, THOUGH QUITE AS MUCH AS HE DESERVED;
SELDOM HEARD OF, AND SCARCELY AT ALL REGRETTED, WHEN THE INTELLIGENCE
OF HIS DEATH ABROAD HAD WORKED ITS WAY TO UPPERCROSS, TWO YEARS BEFORE.

HE HAD, IN FACT, THOUGH HIS SISTERS WERE NOW DOING ALL THEY COULD FOR HIM,
BY CALLING HIM "POOR RICHARD," BEEN NOTHING BETTER THAN A THICK-HEADED,
UNFEELING, UNPROFITABLE DICK MUSGROVE, WHO HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING
TO ENTITLE HIMSELF TO MORE THAN THE ABBREVIATION OF HIS NAME,
LIVING OR DEAD.

HE HAD BEEN SEVERAL YEARS AT SEA, AND HAD, IN THE COURSE OF THOSE REMOVALS
TO WHICH ALL MIDSHIPMEN ARE LIABLE, AND ESPECIALLY SUCH MIDSHIPMEN
AS EVERY CAPTAIN WISHES TO GET RID OF, BEEN SIX MONTHS ON BOARD
CAPTAIN FREDERICK WENTWORTH'S FRIGATE, THE LACONIA; AND FROM THE LACONIA
HE HAD, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIS CAPTAIN, WRITTEN THE ONLY TWO LETTERS
WHICH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HAD EVER RECEIVED FROM HIM DURING THE WHOLE
OF HIS ABSENCE; THAT IS TO SAY, THE ONLY TWO DISINTERESTED LETTERS;
ALL THE REST HAD BEEN MERE APPLICATIONS FOR MONEY.

IN EACH LETTER HE HAD SPOKEN WELL OF HIS CAPTAIN; BUT YET,
SO LITTLE WERE THEY IN THE HABIT OF ATTENDING TO SUCH MATTERS,
SO UNOBSERVANT AND INCURIOUS WERE THEY AS TO THE NAMES OF MEN OR SHIPS,
THAT IT HAD MADE SCARCELY ANY IMPRESSION AT THE TIME; AND THAT MRS MUSGROVE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUDDENLY STRUCK, THIS VERY DAY, WITH A RECOLLECTION
OF THE NAME OF WENTWORTH, AS CONNECTED WITH HER SON, SEEMED ONE OF THOSE
EXTRAORDINARY BURSTS OF MIND WHICH DO SOMETIMES OCCUR.

SHE HAD GONE TO HER LETTERS, AND FOUND IT ALL AS SHE SUPPOSED;
AND THE RE-PERUSAL OF THESE LETTERS, AFTER SO LONG AN INTERVAL,
HER POOR SON GONE FOR EVER, AND ALL THE STRENGTH OF HIS FAULTS FORGOTTEN,
HAD AFFECTED HER SPIRITS EXCEEDINGLY, AND THROWN HER INTO
GREATER GRIEF FOR HIM THAN SHE HAD KNOW ON FIRST HEARING OF HIS DEATH.
MR MUSGROVE WAS, IN A LESSER DEGREE, AFFECTED LIKEWISE; AND WHEN
THEY REACHED THE COTTAGE, THEY WERE EVIDENTLY IN WANT, FIRST,
OF BEING LISTENED TO ANEW ON THIS SUBJECT, AND AFTERWARDS,
OF ALL THE RELIEF WHICH CHEERFUL COMPANIONS COULD GIVE THEM.

TO HEAR THEM TALKING SO MUCH OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, REPEATING HIS NAME
SO OFTEN, PUZZLING OVER PAST YEARS, AND AT LAST ASCERTAINING THAT IT MIGHT,
THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD, TURN OUT TO BE THE VERY SAME CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
WHOM THEY RECOLLECTED MEETING, ONCE OR TWICE, AFTER THEIR COMING BACK
FROM CLIFTON--A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN--BUT THEY COULD NOT SAY WHETHER
IT WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO, WAS A NEW SORT OF TRIAL TO ANNE'S NERVES.
SHE FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT IT WAS ONE TO WHICH SHE MUST INURE HERSELF.
SINCE HE ACTUALLY WAS EXPECTED IN THE COUNTRY, SHE MUST TEACH HERSELF
TO BE INSENSIBLE ON SUCH POINTS.  AND NOT ONLY DID IT APPEAR THAT
HE WAS EXPECTED, AND SPEEDILY, BUT THE MUSGROVES, IN THEIR WARM GRATITUDE
FOR THE KINDNESS HE HAD SHEWN POOR DICK, AND VERY HIGH RESPECT
FOR HIS CHARACTER, STAMPED AS IT WAS BY POOR DICK'S HAVING BEEN
SIX MONTHS UNDER HIS CARE, AND MENTIONING HIM IN STRONG,
THOUGH NOT PERFECTLY WELL-SPELT PRAISE, AS "A FINE DASHING FELOW,
ONLY TWO PERTICULAR ABOUT THE SCHOOLMASTER," WERE BENT ON
INTRODUCING THEMSELVES, AND SEEKING HIS ACQUAINTANCE, AS SOON AS
THEY COULD HEAR OF HIS ARRIVAL.

THE RESOLUTION OF DOING SO HELPED TO FORM THE COMFORT OF THEIR EVENING.



CHAPTER 7


A VERY FEW DAYS MORE, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS KNOWN TO BE AT KELLYNCH,
AND MR MUSGROVE HAD CALLED ON HIM, AND COME BACK WARM IN HIS PRAISE,
AND HE WAS ENGAGED WITH THE CROFTS TO DINE AT UPPERCROSS,
BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK.  IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
TO MR MUSGROVE TO FIND THAT NO EARLIER DAY COULD BE FIXED,
SO IMPATIENT WAS HE TO SHEW HIS GRATITUDE, BY SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
UNDER HIS OWN ROOF, AND WELCOMING HIM TO ALL THAT WAS STRONGEST
AND BEST IN HIS CELLARS.  BUT A WEEK MUST PASS; ONLY A WEEK,
IN ANNE'S RECKONING, AND THEN, SHE SUPPOSED, THEY MUST MEET;
AND SOON SHE BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE COULD FEEL SECURE EVEN FOR A WEEK.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH MADE A VERY EARLY RETURN TO MR MUSGROVE'S CIVILITY,
AND SHE WAS ALL BUT CALLING THERE IN THE SAME HALF HOUR.
SHE AND MARY WERE ACTUALLY SETTING FORWARD FOR THE GREAT HOUSE,
WHERE, AS SHE AFTERWARDS LEARNT, THEY MUST INEVITABLY HAVE FOUND HIM,
WHEN THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE ELDEST BOY'S BEING AT THAT MOMENT
BROUGHT HOME IN CONSEQUENCE OF A BAD FALL.  THE CHILD'S SITUATION
PUT THE VISIT ENTIRELY ASIDE; BUT SHE COULD NOT HEAR OF HER ESCAPE
WITH INDIFFERENCE, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE SERIOUS ANXIETY
WHICH THEY AFTERWARDS FELT ON HIS ACCOUNT.

HIS COLLAR-BONE WAS FOUND TO BE DISLOCATED, AND SUCH INJURY
RECEIVED IN THE BACK, AS ROUSED THE MOST ALARMING IDEAS.
IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF DISTRESS, AND ANNE HAD EVERY THING TO DO AT ONCE;
THE APOTHECARY TO SEND FOR, THE FATHER TO HAVE PURSUED AND INFORMED,
THE MOTHER TO SUPPORT AND KEEP FROM HYSTERICS, THE SERVANTS TO CONTROL,
THE YOUNGEST CHILD TO BANISH, AND THE POOR SUFFERING ONE TO ATTEND
AND SOOTHE; BESIDES SENDING, AS SOON AS SHE RECOLLECTED IT,
PROPER NOTICE TO THE OTHER HOUSE, WHICH BROUGHT HER AN ACCESSION
RATHER OF FRIGHTENED, ENQUIRING COMPANIONS, THAN OF VERY USEFUL ASSISTANTS.

HER BROTHER'S RETURN WAS THE FIRST COMFORT; HE COULD TAKE BEST CARE
OF HIS WIFE; AND THE SECOND BLESSING WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THE APOTHECARY.
TILL HE CAME AND HAD EXAMINED THE CHILD, THEIR APPREHENSIONS WERE
THE WORSE FOR BEING VAGUE; THEY SUSPECTED GREAT INJURY, BUT KNEW NOT WHERE;
BUT NOW THE COLLAR-BONE WAS SOON REPLACED, AND THOUGH MR ROBINSON
FELT AND FELT, AND RUBBED, AND LOOKED GRAVE, AND SPOKE LOW WORDS
BOTH TO THE FATHER AND THE AUNT, STILL THEY WERE ALL TO HOPE THE BEST,
AND TO BE ABLE TO PART AND EAT THEIR DINNER IN TOLERABLE EASE OF MIND;
AND THEN IT WAS, JUST BEFORE THEY PARTED, THAT THE TWO YOUNG AUNTS
WERE ABLE SO FAR TO DIGRESS FROM THEIR NEPHEW'S STATE, AS TO GIVE
THE INFORMATION OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S VISIT; STAYING FIVE MINUTES BEHIND
THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER, TO ENDEAVOUR TO EXPRESS HOW PERFECTLY DELIGHTED
THEY WERE WITH HIM, HOW MUCH HANDSOMER, HOW INFINITELY MORE AGREEABLE
THEY THOUGHT HIM THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL AMONG THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCE,
WHO HAD BEEN AT ALL A FAVOURITE BEFORE.  HOW GLAD THEY HAD BEEN
TO HEAR PAPA INVITE HIM TO STAY DINNER, HOW SORRY WHEN HE SAID
IT WAS QUITE OUT OF HIS POWER, AND HOW GLAD AGAIN WHEN HE HAD PROMISED
IN REPLY TO PAPA AND MAMMA'S FARTHER PRESSING INVITATIONS TO COME
AND DINE WITH THEM ON THE MORROW--ACTUALLY ON THE MORROW;
AND HE HAD PROMISED IT IN SO PLEASANT A MANNER, AS IF HE FELT
ALL THE MOTIVE OF THEIR ATTENTION JUST AS HE OUGHT.  AND IN SHORT,
HE HAD LOOKED AND SAID EVERYTHING WITH SUCH EXQUISITE GRACE,
THAT THEY COULD ASSURE THEM ALL, THEIR HEADS WERE BOTH TURNED BY HIM;
AND OFF THEY RAN, QUITE AS FULL OF GLEE AS OF LOVE, AND APPARENTLY
MORE FULL OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAN OF LITTLE CHARLES.

THE SAME STORY AND THE SAME RAPTURES WERE REPEATED, WHEN THE TWO GIRLS CAME
WITH THEIR FATHER, THROUGH THE GLOOM OF THE EVENING, TO MAKE ENQUIRIES;
AND MR MUSGROVE, NO LONGER UNDER THE FIRST UNEASINESS ABOUT HIS HEIR,
COULD ADD HIS CONFIRMATION AND PRAISE, AND HOPE THERE WOULD BE NOW
NO OCCASION FOR PUTTING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OFF, AND ONLY BE SORRY TO THINK
THAT THE COTTAGE PARTY, PROBABLY, WOULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE THE LITTLE BOY,
TO GIVE HIM THE MEETING.  "OH NO; AS TO LEAVING THE LITTLE BOY,"
BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER WERE IN MUCH TOO STRONG AND RECENT ALARM
TO BEAR THE THOUGHT; AND ANNE, IN THE JOY OF THE ESCAPE,
COULD NOT HELP ADDING HER WARM PROTESTATIONS TO THEIRS.

CHARLES MUSGROVE, INDEED, AFTERWARDS, SHEWED MORE OF INCLINATION;
"THE CHILD WAS GOING ON SO WELL, AND HE WISHED SO MUCH TO BE INTRODUCED
TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, THAT, PERHAPS, HE MIGHT JOIN THEM IN THE EVENING;
HE WOULD NOT DINE FROM HOME, BUT HE MIGHT WALK IN FOR HALF AN HOUR."
BUT IN THIS HE WAS EAGERLY OPPOSED BY HIS WIFE, WITH "OH! NO, INDEED,
CHARLES, I CANNOT BEAR TO HAVE YOU GO AWAY.  ONLY THINK IF ANYTHING
SHOULD HAPPEN?"

THE CHILD HAD A GOOD NIGHT, AND WAS GOING ON WELL THE NEXT DAY.
IT MUST BE A WORK OF TIME TO ASCERTAIN THAT NO INJURY HAD BEEN
DONE TO THE SPINE; BUT MR ROBINSON FOUND NOTHING TO INCREASE ALARM,
AND CHARLES MUSGROVE BEGAN, CONSEQUENTLY, TO FEEL NO NECESSITY
FOR LONGER CONFINEMENT.  THE CHILD WAS TO BE KEPT IN BED AND AMUSED
AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE; BUT WHAT WAS THERE FOR A FATHER TO DO?
THIS WAS QUITE A FEMALE CASE, AND IT WOULD BE HIGHLY ABSURD IN HIM,
WHO COULD BE OF NO USE AT HOME, TO SHUT HIMSELF UP.  HIS FATHER
VERY MUCH WISHED HIM TO MEET CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AND THERE BEING
NO SUFFICIENT REASON AGAINST IT, HE OUGHT TO GO; AND IT ENDED IN HIS
MAKING A BOLD, PUBLIC DECLARATION, WHEN HE CAME IN FROM SHOOTING,
OF HIS MEANING TO DRESS DIRECTLY, AND DINE AT THE OTHER HOUSE.

"NOTHING CAN BE GOING ON BETTER THAN THE CHILD," SAID HE;
"SO I TOLD MY FATHER, JUST NOW, THAT I WOULD COME, AND HE THOUGHT ME
QUITE RIGHT.  YOUR SISTER BEING WITH YOU, MY LOVE, I HAVE NO SCRUPLE AT ALL.
YOU WOULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE HIM YOURSELF, BUT YOU SEE I CAN BE OF NO USE.
ANNE WILL SEND FOR ME IF ANYTHING IS THE MATTER."

HUSBANDS AND WIVES GENERALLY UNDERSTAND WHEN OPPOSITION WILL BE VAIN.
MARY KNEW, FROM CHARLES'S MANNER OF SPEAKING, THAT HE WAS
QUITE DETERMINED ON GOING, AND THAT IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO TEAZE HIM.
SHE SAID NOTHING, THEREFORE, TILL HE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM,
BUT AS SOON AS THERE WAS ONLY ANNE TO HEAR--

"SO YOU AND I ARE TO BE LEFT TO SHIFT BY OURSELVES, WITH THIS
POOR SICK CHILD; AND NOT A CREATURE COMING NEAR US ALL THE EVENING!
I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE.  THIS IS ALWAYS MY LUCK.  IF THERE IS
ANYTHING DISAGREEABLE GOING ON MEN ARE ALWAYS SURE TO GET OUT OF IT,
AND CHARLES IS AS BAD AS ANY OF THEM.  VERY UNFEELING!  I MUST SAY
IT IS VERY UNFEELING OF HIM TO BE RUNNING AWAY FROM HIS POOR LITTLE BOY.
TALKS OF HIS BEING GOING ON SO WELL!  HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT HE IS
GOING ON WELL, OR THAT THERE MAY NOT BE A SUDDEN CHANGE HALF AN HOUR HENCE?
I DID NOT THINK CHARLES WOULD HAVE BEEN SO UNFEELING.  SO HERE HE IS TO
GO AWAY AND ENJOY HIMSELF, AND BECAUSE I AM THE POOR MOTHER,
I AM NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO STIR; AND YET, I AM SURE, I AM MORE UNFIT
THAN ANYBODY ELSE TO BE ABOUT THE CHILD.  MY BEING THE MOTHER
IS THE VERY REASON WHY MY FEELINGS SHOULD NOT BE TRIED.  I AM NOT AT ALL
EQUAL TO IT.  YOU SAW HOW HYSTERICAL I WAS YESTERDAY."

"BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE EFFECT OF THE SUDDENNESS OF YOUR ALARM--
OF THE SHOCK.  YOU WILL NOT BE HYSTERICAL AGAIN.  I DARE SAY WE SHALL HAVE
NOTHING TO DISTRESS US.  I PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND MR ROBINSON'S DIRECTIONS,
AND HAVE NO FEARS; AND INDEED, MARY, I CANNOT WONDER AT YOUR HUSBAND.
NURSING DOES NOT BELONG TO A MAN; IT IS NOT HIS PROVINCE.
A SICK CHILD IS ALWAYS THE MOTHER'S PROPERTY:  HER OWN FEELINGS
GENERALLY MAKE IT SO."

"I HOPE I AM AS FOND OF MY CHILD AS ANY MOTHER, BUT I DO NOT KNOW
THAT I AM OF ANY MORE USE IN THE SICK-ROOM THAN CHARLES,
FOR I CANNOT BE ALWAYS SCOLDING AND TEAZING THE POOR CHILD WHEN IT IS ILL;
AND YOU SAW, THIS MORNING, THAT IF I TOLD HIM TO KEEP QUIET,
HE WAS SURE TO BEGIN KICKING ABOUT.  I HAVE NOT NERVES
FOR THE SORT OF THING."

"BUT, COULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE YOURSELF, TO BE SPENDING
THE WHOLE EVENING AWAY FROM THE POOR BOY?"

"YES; YOU SEE HIS PAPA CAN, AND WHY SHOULD NOT I?  JEMIMA IS SO CAREFUL;
AND SHE COULD SEND US WORD EVERY HOUR HOW HE WAS.  I REALLY THINK
CHARLES MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TOLD HIS FATHER WE WOULD ALL COME.
I AM NOT MORE ALARMED ABOUT LITTLE CHARLES NOW THAN HE IS.
I WAS DREADFULLY ALARMED YESTERDAY, BUT THE CASE IS VERY DIFFERENT TO-DAY."

"WELL, IF YOU DO NOT THINK IT TOO LATE TO GIVE NOTICE FOR YOURSELF,
SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO GO, AS WELL AS YOUR HUSBAND.  LEAVE LITTLE CHARLES
TO MY CARE.  MR AND MRS MUSGROVE CANNOT THINK IT WRONG WHILE I REMAIN
WITH HIM."

"ARE YOU SERIOUS?" CRIED MARY, HER EYES BRIGHTENING.  "DEAR ME!
THAT'S A VERY GOOD THOUGHT, VERY GOOD, INDEED.  TO BE SURE,
I MAY JUST AS WELL GO AS NOT, FOR I AM OF NO USE AT HOME--AM I?
AND IT ONLY HARASSES ME.  YOU, WHO HAVE NOT A MOTHER'S FEELINGS,
ARE A GREAT DEAL THE PROPEREST PERSON.  YOU CAN MAKE LITTLE CHARLES
DO ANYTHING; HE ALWAYS MINDS YOU AT A WORD.  IT WILL BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER
THAN LEAVING HIM ONLY WITH JEMIMA.  OH! I SHALL CERTAINLY GO;
I AM SURE I OUGHT IF I CAN, QUITE AS MUCH AS CHARLES, FOR THEY WANT ME
EXCESSIVELY TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AND I KNOW
YOU DO NOT MIND BEING LEFT ALONE.  AN EXCELLENT THOUGHT OF YOURS,
INDEED, ANNE.  I WILL GO AND TELL CHARLES, AND GET READY DIRECTLY.
YOU CAN SEND FOR US, YOU KNOW, AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE, IF ANYTHING
IS THE MATTER; BUT I DARE SAY THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO ALARM YOU.
I SHOULD NOT GO, YOU MAY BE SURE, IF I DID NOT FEEL QUITE AT EASE
ABOUT MY DEAR CHILD."

THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS TAPPING AT HER HUSBAND'S DRESSING-ROOM DOOR,
AND AS ANNE FOLLOWED HER UP STAIRS, SHE WAS IN TIME FOR
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION, WHICH BEGAN WITH MARY'S SAYING,
IN A TONE OF GREAT EXULTATION--

"I MEAN TO GO WITH YOU, CHARLES, FOR I AM OF NO MORE USE AT HOME
THAN YOU ARE.  IF I WERE TO SHUT MYSELF UP FOR EVER WITH THE CHILD,
I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PERSUADE HIM TO DO ANYTHING HE DID NOT LIKE.
ANNE WILL STAY; ANNE UNDERTAKES TO STAY AT HOME AND TAKE CARE OF HIM.
IT IS ANNE'S OWN PROPOSAL, AND SO I SHALL GO WITH YOU, WHICH WILL BE
A GREAT DEAL BETTER, FOR I HAVE NOT DINED AT THE OTHER HOUSE SINCE TUESDAY."

"THIS IS VERY KIND OF ANNE," WAS HER HUSBAND'S ANSWER, "AND I SHOULD BE
VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU GO; BUT IT SEEMS RATHER HARD THAT SHE SHOULD BE
LEFT AT HOME BY HERSELF, TO NURSE OUR SICK CHILD."

ANNE WAS NOW AT HAND TO TAKE UP HER OWN CAUSE, AND THE SINCERITY
OF HER MANNER BEING SOON SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE HIM, WHERE CONVICTION
WAS AT LEAST VERY AGREEABLE, HE HAD NO FARTHER SCRUPLES AS TO HER BEING
LEFT TO DINE ALONE, THOUGH HE STILL WANTED HER TO JOIN THEM IN THE EVENING,
WHEN THE CHILD MIGHT BE AT REST FOR THE NIGHT, AND KINDLY URGED HER
TO LET HIM COME AND FETCH HER, BUT SHE WAS QUITE UNPERSUADABLE;
AND THIS BEING THE CASE, SHE HAD ERE LONG THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM
SET OFF TOGETHER IN HIGH SPIRITS.  THEY WERE GONE, SHE HOPED,
TO BE HAPPY, HOWEVER ODDLY CONSTRUCTED SUCH HAPPINESS MIGHT SEEM;
AS FOR HERSELF, SHE WAS LEFT WITH AS MANY SENSATIONS OF COMFORT,
AS WERE, PERHAPS, EVER LIKELY TO BE HERS.  SHE KNEW HERSELF TO BE
OF THE FIRST UTILITY TO THE CHILD; AND WHAT WAS IT TO HER
IF FREDERICK WENTWORTH WERE ONLY HALF A MILE DISTANT, MAKING HIMSELF
AGREEABLE TO OTHERS?

SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW HOW HE FELT AS TO A MEETING.
PERHAPS INDIFFERENT, IF INDIFFERENCE COULD EXIST UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.
HE MUST BE EITHER INDIFFERENT OR UNWILLING.  HAD HE WISHED
EVER TO SEE HER AGAIN, HE NEED NOT HAVE WAITED TILL THIS TIME;
HE WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT SHE COULD NOT BUT BELIEVE THAT IN HIS PLACE
SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO, WHEN EVENTS HAD BEEN EARLY GIVING HIM
THE INDEPENDENCE WHICH ALONE HAD BEEN WANTING.

HER BROTHER AND SISTER CAME BACK DELIGHTED WITH THEIR NEW ACQUAINTANCE,
AND THEIR VISIT IN GENERAL.  THERE HAD BEEN MUSIC, SINGING,
TALKING, LAUGHING, ALL THAT WAS MOST AGREEABLE; CHARMING MANNERS
IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, NO SHYNESS OR RESERVE; THEY SEEMED ALL
TO KNOW EACH OTHER PERFECTLY, AND HE WAS COMING THE VERY NEXT MORNING
TO SHOOT WITH CHARLES.  HE WAS TO COME TO BREAKFAST, BUT NOT AT THE COTTAGE,
THOUGH THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED AT FIRST; BUT THEN HE HAD BEEN PRESSED
TO COME TO THE GREAT HOUSE INSTEAD, AND HE SEEMED AFRAID OF BEING
IN MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE'S WAY, ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHILD, AND THEREFORE,
SOMEHOW, THEY HARDLY KNEW HOW, IT ENDED IN CHARLES'S BEING TO MEET HIM
TO BREAKFAST AT HIS FATHER'S.

ANNE UNDERSTOOD IT.  HE WISHED TO AVOID SEEING HER.  HE HAD INQUIRED
AFTER HER, SHE FOUND, SLIGHTLY, AS MIGHT SUIT A FORMER SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE,
SEEMING TO ACKNOWLEDGE SUCH AS SHE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED, ACTUATED, PERHAPS,
BY THE SAME VIEW OF ESCAPING INTRODUCTION WHEN THEY WERE TO MEET.

THE MORNING HOURS OF THE COTTAGE WERE ALWAYS LATER THAN THOSE
OF THE OTHER HOUSE, AND ON THE MORROW THE DIFFERENCE WAS SO GREAT
THAT MARY AND ANNE WERE NOT MORE THAN BEGINNING BREAKFAST WHEN
CHARLES CAME IN TO SAY THAT THEY WERE JUST SETTING OFF, THAT HE WAS
COME FOR HIS DOGS, THAT HIS SISTERS WERE FOLLOWING WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH;
HIS SISTERS MEANING TO VISIT MARY AND THE CHILD, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
PROPOSING ALSO TO WAIT ON HER FOR A FEW MINUTES IF NOT INCONVENIENT;
AND THOUGH CHARLES HAD ANSWERED FOR THE CHILD'S BEING IN NO SUCH STATE
AS COULD MAKE IT INCONVENIENT, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED
WITHOUT HIS RUNNING ON TO GIVE NOTICE.

MARY, VERY MUCH GRATIFIED BY THIS ATTENTION, WAS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE HIM,
WHILE A THOUSAND FEELINGS RUSHED ON ANNE, OF WHICH THIS WAS
THE MOST CONSOLING, THAT IT WOULD SOON BE OVER.  AND IT WAS SOON OVER.
IN TWO MINUTES AFTER CHARLES'S PREPARATION, THE OTHERS APPEARED;
THEY WERE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM.  HER EYE HALF MET CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S,
A BOW, A CURTSEY PASSED; SHE HEARD HIS VOICE; HE TALKED TO MARY,
SAID ALL THAT WAS RIGHT, SAID SOMETHING TO THE MISS MUSGROVES,
ENOUGH TO MARK AN EASY FOOTING; THE ROOM SEEMED FULL, FULL OF PERSONS
AND VOICES, BUT A FEW MINUTES ENDED IT.  CHARLES SHEWED HIMSELF
AT THE WINDOW, ALL WAS READY, THEIR VISITOR HAD BOWED AND WAS GONE,
THE MISS MUSGROVES WERE GONE TOO, SUDDENLY RESOLVING TO WALK
TO THE END OF THE VILLAGE WITH THE SPORTSMEN:  THE ROOM WAS CLEARED,
AND ANNE MIGHT FINISH HER BREAKFAST AS SHE COULD.

"IT IS OVER! IT IS OVER!" SHE REPEATED TO HERSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN,
IN NERVOUS GRATITUDE.  "THE WORST IS OVER!"

MARY TALKED, BUT SHE COULD NOT ATTEND.  SHE HAD SEEN HIM.
THEY HAD MET.  THEY HAD BEEN ONCE MORE IN THE SAME ROOM.

SOON, HOWEVER, SHE BEGAN TO REASON WITH HERSELF, AND TRY TO BE FEELING LESS.
EIGHT YEARS, ALMOST EIGHT YEARS HAD PASSED, SINCE ALL HAD BEEN GIVEN UP.
HOW ABSURD TO BE RESUMING THE AGITATION WHICH SUCH AN INTERVAL
HAD BANISHED INTO DISTANCE AND INDISTINCTNESS!  WHAT MIGHT NOT
EIGHT YEARS DO?  EVENTS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION, CHANGES, ALIENATIONS,
REMOVALS--ALL, ALL MUST BE COMPRISED IN IT, AND OBLIVION OF THE PAST--
HOW NATURAL, HOW CERTAIN TOO!  IT INCLUDED NEARLY A THIRD PART
OF HER OWN LIFE.

ALAS! WITH ALL HER REASONING, SHE FOUND, THAT TO RETENTIVE FEELINGS
EIGHT YEARS MAY BE LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING.

NOW, HOW WERE HIS SENTIMENTS TO BE READ?  WAS THIS LIKE
WISHING TO AVOID HER?  AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS HATING HERSELF
FOR THE FOLLY WHICH ASKED THE QUESTION.

ON ONE OTHER QUESTION WHICH PERHAPS HER UTMOST WISDOM
MIGHT NOT HAVE PREVENTED, SHE WAS SOON SPARED ALL SUSPENSE;
FOR, AFTER THE MISS MUSGROVES HAD RETURNED AND FINISHED THEIR VISIT
AT THE COTTAGE SHE HAD THIS SPONTANEOUS INFORMATION FROM MARY: --

"CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IS NOT VERY GALLANT BY YOU, ANNE, THOUGH HE WAS
SO ATTENTIVE TO ME.  HENRIETTA ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF YOU,
WHEN THEY WENT AWAY, AND HE SAID, `YOU WERE SO ALTERED HE SHOULD NOT
HAVE KNOWN YOU AGAIN.'"

MARY HAD NO FEELINGS TO MAKE HER RESPECT HER SISTER'S IN A COMMON WAY,
BUT SHE WAS PERFECTLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF BEING INFLICTING ANY PECULIAR WOUND.

"ALTERED BEYOND HIS KNOWLEDGE."  ANNE FULLY SUBMITTED, IN SILENT,
DEEP MORTIFICATION.  DOUBTLESS IT WAS SO, AND SHE COULD TAKE NO REVENGE,
FOR HE WAS NOT ALTERED, OR NOT FOR THE WORSE.  SHE HAD ALREADY
ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HERSELF, AND SHE COULD NOT THINK DIFFERENTLY,
LET HIM THINK OF HER AS HE WOULD.  NO:  THE YEARS WHICH HAD DESTROYED
HER YOUTH AND BLOOM HAD ONLY GIVEN HIM A MORE GLOWING, MANLY,
OPEN LOOK, IN NO RESPECT LESSENING HIS PERSONAL ADVANTAGES.
SHE HAD SEEN THE SAME FREDERICK WENTWORTH.

"SO ALTERED THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HER AGAIN!"  THESE WERE WORDS
WHICH COULD NOT BUT DWELL WITH HER.  YET SHE SOON BEGAN TO REJOICE
THAT SHE HAD HEARD THEM.  THEY WERE OF SOBERING TENDENCY;
THEY ALLAYED AGITATION; THEY COMPOSED, AND CONSEQUENTLY MUST
MAKE HER HAPPIER.

FREDERICK WENTWORTH HAD USED SUCH WORDS, OR SOMETHING LIKE THEM,
BUT WITHOUT AN IDEA THAT THEY WOULD BE CARRIED ROUND TO HER.
HE HAD THOUGHT HER WRETCHEDLY ALTERED, AND IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF APPEAL,
HAD SPOKEN AS HE FELT.  HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN ANNE ELLIOT.
SHE HAD USED HIM ILL, DESERTED AND DISAPPOINTED HIM; AND WORSE,
SHE HAD SHEWN A FEEBLENESS OF CHARACTER IN DOING SO, WHICH HIS OWN DECIDED,
CONFIDENT TEMPER COULD NOT ENDURE.  SHE HAD GIVEN HIM UP TO OBLIGE OTHERS.
IT HAD BEEN THE EFFECT OF OVER-PERSUASION.  IT HAD BEEN
WEAKNESS AND TIMIDITY.

HE HAD BEEN MOST WARMLY ATTACHED TO HER, AND HAD NEVER SEEN A WOMAN SINCE
WHOM HE THOUGHT HER EQUAL; BUT, EXCEPT FROM SOME NATURAL SENSATION
OF CURIOSITY, HE HAD NO DESIRE OF MEETING HER AGAIN.  HER POWER WITH HIM
WAS GONE FOR EVER.

IT WAS NOW HIS OBJECT TO MARRY.  HE WAS RICH, AND BEING TURNED ON SHORE,
FULLY INTENDED TO SETTLE AS SOON AS HE COULD BE PROPERLY TEMPTED;
ACTUALLY LOOKING ROUND, READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ALL THE SPEED
WHICH A CLEAR HEAD AND A QUICK TASTE COULD ALLOW.  HE HAD A HEART
FOR EITHER OF THE MISS MUSGROVES, IF THEY COULD CATCH IT; A HEART,
IN SHORT, FOR ANY PLEASING YOUNG WOMAN WHO CAME IN HIS WAY,
EXCEPTING ANNE ELLIOT.  THIS WAS HIS ONLY SECRET EXCEPTION,
WHEN HE SAID TO HIS SISTER, IN ANSWER TO HER SUPPOSITIONS:--

"YES, HERE I AM, SOPHIA, QUITE READY TO MAKE A FOOLISH MATCH.
ANYBODY BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND THIRTY MAY HAVE ME FOR ASKING.
A LITTLE BEAUTY, AND A FEW SMILES, AND A FEW COMPLIMENTS TO THE NAVY,
AND I AM A LOST MAN.  SHOULD NOT THIS BE ENOUGH FOR A SAILOR,
WHO HAS HAD NO SOCIETY AMONG WOMEN TO MAKE HIM NICE?"

HE SAID IT, SHE KNEW, TO BE CONTRADICTED.  HIS BRIGHT PROUD EYE
SPOKE THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS NICE; AND ANNE ELLIOT WAS
NOT OUT OF HIS THOUGHTS, WHEN HE MORE SERIOUSLY DESCRIBED
THE WOMAN HE SHOULD WISH TO MEET WITH.  "A STRONG MIND,
WITH SWEETNESS OF MANNER," MADE THE FIRST AND THE LAST OF THE DESCRIPTION.

"THAT IS THE WOMAN I WANT," SAID HE.  "SOMETHING A LITTLE INFERIOR
I SHALL OF COURSE PUT UP WITH, BUT IT MUST NOT BE MUCH.  IF I AM A FOOL,
I SHALL BE A FOOL INDEED, FOR I HAVE THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT
MORE THAN MOST MEN."



CHAPTER 8


FROM THIS TIME CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AND ANNE ELLIOT WERE REPEATEDLY
IN THE SAME CIRCLE.  THEY WERE SOON DINING IN COMPANY TOGETHER
AT MR MUSGROVE'S, FOR THE LITTLE BOY'S STATE COULD NO LONGER
SUPPLY HIS AUNT WITH A PRETENCE FOR ABSENTING HERSELF; AND THIS WAS
BUT THE BEGINNING OF OTHER DININGS AND OTHER MEETINGS.

WHETHER FORMER FEELINGS WERE TO BE RENEWED MUST BE BROUGHT TO THE PROOF;
FORMER TIMES MUST UNDOUBTEDLY BE BROUGHT TO THE RECOLLECTION OF EACH;
THEY COULD NOT BUT BE REVERTED TO; THE YEAR OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT
COULD NOT BUT BE NAMED BY HIM, IN THE LITTLE NARRATIVES OR DESCRIPTIONS
WHICH CONVERSATION CALLED FORTH.  HIS PROFESSION QUALIFIED HIM,
HIS DISPOSITION LEAD HIM, TO TALK; AND "THAT WAS IN THE YEAR SIX;"
"THAT HAPPENED BEFORE I WENT TO SEA IN THE YEAR SIX," OCCURRED
IN THE COURSE OF THE FIRST EVENING THEY SPENT TOGETHER:
AND THOUGH HIS VOICE DID NOT FALTER, AND THOUGH SHE HAD NO REASON
TO SUPPOSE HIS EYE WANDERING TOWARDS HER WHILE HE SPOKE,
ANNE FELT THE UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY, FROM HER KNOWLEDGE OF HIS MIND,
THAT HE COULD BE UNVISITED BY REMEMBRANCE ANY MORE THAN HERSELF.
THERE MUST BE THE SAME IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION OF THOUGHT,
THOUGH SHE WAS VERY FAR FROM CONCEIVING IT TO BE OF EQUAL PAIN.

THEY HAD NO CONVERSATION TOGETHER, NO INTERCOURSE BUT WHAT
THE COMMONEST CIVILITY REQUIRED.  ONCE SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER!
NOW NOTHING!  THERE HAD BEEN A TIME, WHEN OF ALL THE LARGE PARTY
NOW FILLING THE DRAWING-ROOM AT UPPERCROSS, THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT
MOST DIFFICULT TO CEASE TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER.  WITH THE EXCEPTION,
PERHAPS, OF ADMIRAL AND MRS CROFT, WHO SEEMED PARTICULARLY ATTACHED
AND HAPPY, (ANNE COULD ALLOW NO OTHER EXCEPTIONS EVEN AMONG
THE MARRIED COUPLES), THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO TWO HEARTS SO OPEN,
NO TASTES SO SIMILAR, NO FEELINGS SO IN UNISON, NO COUNTENANCES SO BELOVED.
NOW THEY WERE AS STRANGERS; NAY, WORSE THAN STRANGERS, FOR THEY COULD
NEVER BECOME ACQUAINTED.  IT WAS A PERPETUAL ESTRANGEMENT.

WHEN HE TALKED, SHE HEARD THE SAME VOICE, AND DISCERNED THE SAME MIND.
THERE WAS A VERY GENERAL IGNORANCE OF ALL NAVAL MATTERS THROUGHOUT THE PARTY;
AND HE WAS VERY MUCH QUESTIONED, AND ESPECIALLY BY THE TWO MISS MUSGROVES,
WHO SEEMED HARDLY TO HAVE ANY EYES BUT FOR HIM, AS TO THE MANNER
OF LIVING ON BOARD, DAILY REGULATIONS, FOOD, HOURS, &C., AND THEIR SURPRISE
AT HIS ACCOUNTS, AT LEARNING THE DEGREE OF ACCOMMODATION AND ARRANGEMENT
WHICH WAS PRACTICABLE, DREW FROM HIM SOME PLEASANT RIDICULE,
WHICH REMINDED ANNE OF THE EARLY DAYS WHEN SHE TOO HAD BEEN IGNORANT,
AND SHE TOO HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF SUPPOSING SAILORS TO BE LIVING ON BOARD
WITHOUT ANYTHING TO EAT, OR ANY COOK TO DRESS IT IF THERE WERE,
OR ANY SERVANT TO WAIT, OR ANY KNIFE AND FORK TO USE.

FROM THUS LISTENING AND THINKING, SHE WAS ROUSED BY A WHISPER
OF MRS MUSGROVE'S WHO, OVERCOME BY FOND REGRETS, COULD NOT HELP SAYING--

"AH! MISS ANNE, IF IT HAD PLEASED HEAVEN TO SPARE MY POOR SON,
I DARE SAY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST SUCH ANOTHER BY THIS TIME."

ANNE SUPPRESSED A SMILE, AND LISTENED KINDLY, WHILE MRS MUSGROVE
RELIEVED HER HEART A LITTLE MORE; AND FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEREFORE,
COULD NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE CONVERSATION OF THE OTHERS.

WHEN SHE COULD LET HER ATTENTION TAKE ITS NATURAL COURSE AGAIN,
SHE FOUND THE MISS MUSGROVES JUST FETCHING THE NAVY LIST
(THEIR OWN NAVY LIST, THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER BEEN AT UPPERCROSS),
AND SITTING DOWN TOGETHER TO PORE OVER IT, WITH THE PROFESSED VIEW
OF FINDING OUT THE SHIPS THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD COMMANDED.

"YOUR FIRST WAS THE ASP, I REMEMBER; WE WILL LOOK FOR THE ASP."

"YOU WILL NOT FIND HER THERE.  QUITE WORN OUT AND BROKEN UP.
I WAS THE LAST MAN WHO COMMANDED HER.  HARDLY FIT FOR SERVICE THEN.
REPORTED FIT FOR HOME SERVICE FOR A YEAR OR TWO, AND SO I WAS SENT OFF
TO THE WEST INDIES."

THE GIRLS LOOKED ALL AMAZEMENT.

"THE ADMIRALTY," HE CONTINUED, "ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES NOW AND THEN,
WITH SENDING A FEW HUNDRED MEN TO SEA, IN A SHIP NOT FIT TO BE EMPLOYED.
BUT THEY HAVE A GREAT MANY TO PROVIDE FOR; AND AMONG THE THOUSANDS
THAT MAY JUST AS WELL GO TO THE BOTTOM AS NOT, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR THEM TO DISTINGUISH THE VERY SET WHO MAY BE LEAST MISSED."

"PHOO! PHOO!" CRIED THE ADMIRAL, "WHAT STUFF THESE YOUNG FELLOWS TALK!
NEVER WAS A BETTER SLOOP THAN THE ASP IN HER DAY.  FOR AN OLD BUILT SLOOP,
YOU WOULD NOT SEE HER EQUAL.  LUCKY FELLOW TO GET HER!  HE KNOWS THERE
MUST HAVE BEEN TWENTY BETTER MEN THAN HIMSELF APPLYING FOR HER
AT THE SAME TIME.  LUCKY FELLOW TO GET ANYTHING SO SOON,
WITH NO MORE INTEREST THAN HIS."

"I FELT MY LUCK, ADMIRAL, I ASSURE YOU;" REPLIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
SERIOUSLY.  "I WAS AS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY APPOINTMENT AS YOU CAN DESIRE.
IT WAS A GREAT OBJECT WITH ME AT THAT TIME TO BE AT SEA;
A VERY GREAT OBJECT, I WANTED TO BE DOING SOMETHING."

"TO BE SURE YOU DID.  WHAT SHOULD A YOUNG FELLOW LIKE YOU DO ASHORE
FOR HALF A YEAR TOGETHER?  IF A MAN HAD NOT A WIFE, HE SOON WANTS
TO BE AFLOAT AGAIN."

"BUT, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH," CRIED LOUISA, "HOW VEXED YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
WHEN YOU CAME TO THE ASP, TO SEE WHAT AN OLD THING THEY HAD GIVEN YOU."

"I KNEW PRETTY WELL WHAT SHE WAS BEFORE THAT DAY;" SAID HE, SMILING.
"I HAD NO MORE DISCOVERIES TO MAKE THAN YOU WOULD HAVE AS TO
THE FASHION AND STRENGTH OF ANY OLD PELISSE, WHICH YOU HAD SEEN
LENT ABOUT AMONG HALF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE EVER SINCE YOU COULD REMEMBER,
AND WHICH AT LAST, ON SOME VERY WET DAY, IS LENT TO YOURSELF.
AH! SHE WAS A DEAR OLD ASP TO ME.  SHE DID ALL THAT I WANTED.
I KNEW SHE WOULD.  I KNEW THAT WE SHOULD EITHER GO TO THE BOTTOM TOGETHER,
OR THAT SHE WOULD BE THE MAKING OF ME; AND I NEVER HAD TWO DAYS
OF FOUL WEATHER ALL THE TIME I WAS AT SEA IN HER; AND AFTER
TAKING PRIVATEERS ENOUGH TO BE VERY ENTERTAINING, I HAD THE GOOD LUCK
IN MY PASSAGE HOME THE NEXT AUTUMN, TO FALL IN WITH THE VERY FRENCH FRIGATE
I WANTED.  I BROUGHT HER INTO PLYMOUTH; AND HERE ANOTHER INSTANCE OF LUCK.
WE HAD NOT BEEN SIX HOURS IN THE SOUND, WHEN A GALE CAME ON,
WHICH LASTED FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS, AND WHICH WOULD HAVE DONE FOR
POOR OLD ASP IN HALF THE TIME; OUR TOUCH WITH THE GREAT NATION
NOT HAVING MUCH IMPROVED OUR CONDITION.  FOUR-AND-TWENTY HOURS LATER,
AND I SHOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN A GALLANT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
IN A SMALL PARAGRAPH AT ONE CORNER OF THE NEWSPAPERS; AND BEING LOST
IN ONLY A SLOOP, NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ME." ANNE'S SHUDDERINGS
WERE TO HERSELF ALONE; BUT THE MISS MUSGROVES COULD BE AS OPEN
AS THEY WERE SINCERE, IN THEIR EXCLAMATIONS OF PITY AND HORROR.

"AND SO THEN, I SUPPOSE," SAID MRS MUSGROVE, IN A LOW VOICE,
AS IF THINKING ALOUD, "SO THEN HE WENT AWAY TO THE LACONIA, AND THERE
HE MET WITH OUR POOR BOY. CHARLES, MY DEAR," (BECKONING HIM TO HER),
"DO ASK CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WHERE IT WAS HE FIRST MET WITH YOUR POOR BROTHER.
I ALWAYS FORGOT."

"IT WAS AT GIBRALTAR, MOTHER, I KNOW.  DICK HAD BEEN LEFT ILL AT GIBRALTAR,
WITH A RECOMMENDATION FROM HIS FORMER CAPTAIN TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH."

"OH! BUT, CHARLES, TELL CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, HE NEED NOT BE AFRAID
OF MENTIONING POOR DICK BEFORE ME, FOR IT WOULD BE RATHER A PLEASURE
TO HEAR HIM TALKED OF BY SUCH A GOOD FRIEND."

CHARLES, BEING SOMEWHAT MORE MINDFUL OF THE PROBABILITIES OF THE CASE,
ONLY NODDED IN REPLY, AND WALKED AWAY.

THE GIRLS WERE NOW HUNTING FOR THE LACONIA; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
COULD NOT DENY HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF TAKING THE PRECIOUS VOLUME
INTO HIS OWN HANDS TO SAVE THEM THE TROUBLE, AND ONCE MORE READ ALOUD
THE LITTLE STATEMENT OF HER NAME AND RATE, AND PRESENT
NON-COMMISSIONED CLASS, OBSERVING OVER IT THAT SHE TOO HAD BEEN
ONE OF THE BEST FRIENDS MAN EVER HAD.

"AH! THOSE WERE PLEASANT DAYS WHEN I HAD THE LACONIA!  HOW FAST I
MADE MONEY IN HER.  A FRIEND OF MINE AND I HAD SUCH A LOVELY CRUISE
TOGETHER OFF THE WESTERN ISLANDS.  POOR HARVILLE, SISTER!
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HE WANTED MONEY:  WORSE THAN MYSELF.  HE HAD A WIFE.
EXCELLENT FELLOW.  I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIS HAPPINESS.  HE FELT IT ALL,
SO MUCH FOR HER SAKE.  I WISHED FOR HIM AGAIN THE NEXT SUMMER,
WHEN I HAD STILL THE SAME LUCK IN THE MEDITERRANEAN."

"AND I AM SURE, SIR." SAID MRS MUSGROVE, "IT WAS A LUCKY DAY FOR US,
WHEN YOU WERE PUT CAPTAIN INTO THAT SHIP.  WE SHALL NEVER FORGET
WHAT YOU DID."

HER FEELINGS MADE HER SPEAK LOW; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
HEARING ONLY IN PART, AND PROBABLY NOT HAVING DICK MUSGROVE AT ALL
NEAR HIS THOUGHTS, LOOKED RATHER IN SUSPENSE, AND AS IF WAITING FOR MORE.

"MY BROTHER," WHISPERED ONE OF THE GIRLS; "MAMMA IS THINKING
OF POOR RICHARD."

"POOR DEAR FELLOW!" CONTINUED MRS MUSGROVE; "HE WAS GROWN SO STEADY,
AND SUCH AN EXCELLENT CORRESPONDENT, WHILE HE WAS UNDER YOUR CARE!
AH! IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HAPPY THING, IF HE HAD NEVER LEFT YOU.
I ASSURE YOU, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WE ARE VERY SORRY HE EVER LEFT YOU."

THERE WAS A MOMENTARY EXPRESSION IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S FACE AT THIS SPEECH,
A CERTAIN GLANCE OF HIS BRIGHT EYE, AND CURL OF HIS HANDSOME MOUTH,
WHICH CONVINCED ANNE, THAT INSTEAD OF SHARING IN MRS MUSGROVE'S KIND WISHES,
AS TO HER SON, HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN AT SOME PAINS TO GET RID OF HIM;
BUT IT WAS TOO TRANSIENT AN INDULGENCE OF SELF-AMUSEMENT TO BE DETECTED
BY ANY WHO UNDERSTOOD HIM LESS THAN HERSELF; IN ANOTHER MOMENT
HE WAS PERFECTLY COLLECTED AND SERIOUS, AND ALMOST INSTANTLY AFTERWARDS
COMING UP TO THE SOFA, ON WHICH SHE AND MRS MUSGROVE WERE SITTING,
TOOK A PLACE BY THE LATTER, AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH HER,
IN A LOW VOICE, ABOUT HER SON, DOING IT WITH SO MUCH SYMPATHY
AND NATURAL GRACE, AS SHEWED THE KINDEST CONSIDERATION FOR ALL
THAT WAS REAL AND UNABSURD IN THE PARENT'S FEELINGS.

THEY WERE ACTUALLY ON THE SAME SOFA, FOR MRS MUSGROVE HAD
MOST READILY MADE ROOM FOR HIM; THEY WERE DIVIDED ONLY BY MRS MUSGROVE.
IT WAS NO INSIGNIFICANT BARRIER, INDEED.  MRS MUSGROVE WAS OF
A COMFORTABLE, SUBSTANTIAL SIZE, INFINITELY MORE FITTED BY NATURE
TO EXPRESS GOOD CHEER AND GOOD HUMOUR, THAN TENDERNESS AND SENTIMENT;
AND WHILE THE AGITATIONS OF ANNE'S SLENDER FORM, AND PENSIVE FACE,
MAY BE CONSIDERED AS VERY COMPLETELY SCREENED, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
SHOULD BE ALLOWED SOME CREDIT FOR THE SELF-COMMAND WITH WHICH
HE ATTENDED TO HER LARGE FAT SIGHINGS OVER THE DESTINY OF A SON,
WHOM ALIVE NOBODY HAD CARED FOR.

PERSONAL SIZE AND MENTAL SORROW HAVE CERTAINLY NO NECESSARY PROPORTIONS.
A LARGE BULKY FIGURE HAS AS GOOD A RIGHT TO BE IN DEEP AFFLICTION,
AS THE MOST GRACEFUL SET OF LIMBS IN THE WORLD.  BUT, FAIR OR NOT FAIR,
THERE ARE UNBECOMING CONJUNCTIONS, WHICH REASON WILL PATRONIZE IN VAIN--
WHICH TASTE CANNOT TOLERATE--WHICH RIDICULE WILL SEIZE.

THE ADMIRAL, AFTER TAKING TWO OR THREE REFRESHING TURNS ABOUT THE ROOM
WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM, BEING CALLED TO ORDER BY HIS WIFE,
NOW CAME UP TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AND WITHOUT ANY OBSERVATION
OF WHAT HE MIGHT BE INTERRUPTING, THINKING ONLY OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS,
BEGAN WITH--

"IF YOU HAD BEEN A WEEK LATER AT LISBON, LAST SPRING, FREDERICK,
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE A PASSAGE TO LADY MARY GRIERSON
AND HER DAUGHTERS."

"SHOULD I?  I AM GLAD I WAS NOT A WEEK LATER THEN."

THE ADMIRAL ABUSED HIM FOR HIS WANT OF GALLANTRY.  HE DEFENDED HIMSELF;
THOUGH PROFESSING THAT HE WOULD NEVER WILLINGLY ADMIT ANY LADIES
ON BOARD A SHIP OF HIS, EXCEPTING FOR A BALL, OR A VISIT,
WHICH A FEW HOURS MIGHT COMPREHEND.

"BUT, IF I KNOW MYSELF," SAID HE, "THIS IS FROM NO WANT OF GALLANTRY
TOWARDS THEM.  IT IS RATHER FROM FEELING HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS,
WITH ALL ONE'S EFFORTS, AND ALL ONE'S SACRIFICES, TO MAKE
THE ACCOMMODATIONS ON BOARD SUCH AS WOMEN OUGHT TO HAVE.
THERE CAN BE NO WANT OF GALLANTRY, ADMIRAL, IN RATING THE CLAIMS OF WOMEN
TO EVERY PERSONAL COMFORT HIGH, AND THIS IS WHAT I DO.  I HATE TO HEAR
OF WOMEN ON BOARD, OR TO SEE THEM ON BOARD; AND NO SHIP UNDER MY COMMAND
SHALL EVER CONVEY A FAMILY OF LADIES ANYWHERE, IF I CAN HELP IT."

THIS BROUGHT HIS SISTER UPON HIM.

"OH! FREDERICK!  BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE IT OF YOU. --ALL IDLE REFINEMENT!
--WOMEN MAY BE AS COMFORTABLE ON BOARD, AS IN THE BEST HOUSE IN ENGLAND.
I BELIEVE I HAVE LIVED AS MUCH ON BOARD AS MOST WOMEN, AND I KNOW
NOTHING SUPERIOR TO THE ACCOMMODATIONS OF A MAN-OF-WAR.  I DECLARE
I HAVE NOT A COMFORT OR AN INDULGENCE ABOUT ME, EVEN AT KELLYNCH HALL,"
(WITH A KIND BOW TO ANNE), "BEYOND WHAT I ALWAYS HAD IN MOST OF
THE SHIPS I HAVE LIVED IN; AND THEY HAVE BEEN FIVE ALTOGETHER."

"NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE," REPLIED HER BROTHER.  "YOU WERE LIVING
WITH YOUR HUSBAND, AND WERE THE ONLY WOMAN ON BOARD."

"BUT YOU, YOURSELF, BROUGHT MRS HARVILLE, HER SISTER, HER COUSIN,
AND THREE CHILDREN, ROUND FROM PORTSMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH.  WHERE WAS THIS
SUPERFINE, EXTRAORDINARY SORT OF GALLANTRY OF YOURS THEN?"

"ALL MERGED IN MY FRIENDSHIP, SOPHIA.  I WOULD ASSIST ANY
BROTHER OFFICER'S WIFE THAT I COULD, AND I WOULD BRING ANYTHING
OF HARVILLE'S FROM THE WORLD'S END, IF HE WANTED IT.  BUT DO NOT IMAGINE
THAT I DID NOT FEEL IT AN EVIL IN ITSELF."

"DEPEND UPON IT, THEY WERE ALL PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE."

"I MIGHT NOT LIKE THEM THE BETTER FOR THAT PERHAPS.  SUCH A NUMBER
OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE COMFORTABLE ON BOARD."

"MY DEAR FREDERICK, YOU ARE TALKING QUITE IDLY.  PRAY, WHAT WOULD
BECOME OF US POOR SAILORS' WIVES, WHO OFTEN WANT TO BE CONVEYED TO
ONE PORT OR ANOTHER, AFTER OUR HUSBANDS, IF EVERYBODY HAD YOUR FEELINGS?"

"MY FEELINGS, YOU SEE, DID NOT PREVENT MY TAKING MRS HARVILLE
AND ALL HER FAMILY TO PLYMOUTH."

"BUT I HATE TO HEAR YOU TALKING SO LIKE A FINE GENTLEMAN,
AND AS IF WOMEN WERE ALL FINE LADIES, INSTEAD OF RATIONAL CREATURES.
WE NONE OF US EXPECT TO BE IN SMOOTH WATER ALL OUR DAYS."

"AH! MY DEAR," SAID THE ADMIRAL, "WHEN HE HAD GOT A WIFE,
HE WILL SING A DIFFERENT TUNE.  WHEN HE IS MARRIED, IF WE HAVE
THE GOOD LUCK TO LIVE TO ANOTHER WAR, WE SHALL SEE HIM DO AS YOU AND I,
AND A GREAT MANY OTHERS, HAVE DONE.  WE SHALL HAVE HIM VERY THANKFUL
TO ANYBODY THAT WILL BRING HIM HIS WIFE."

"AY, THAT WE SHALL."

"NOW I HAVE DONE," CRIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  "WHEN ONCE MARRIED
PEOPLE BEGIN TO ATTACK ME WITH,--`OH! YOU WILL THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY,
WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED.'  I CAN ONLY SAY, `NO, I SHALL NOT;' AND THEN
THEY SAY AGAIN, `YES, YOU WILL,' AND THERE IS AN END OF IT."

HE GOT UP AND MOVED AWAY.

"WHAT A GREAT TRAVELLER YOU MUST HAVE BEEN, MA'AM!" SAID MRS MUSGROVE
TO MRS CROFT.

"PRETTY WELL, MA'AM IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS OF MY MARRIAGE;
THOUGH MANY WOMEN HAVE DONE MORE.  I HAVE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC
FOUR TIMES, AND HAVE BEEN ONCE TO THE EAST INDIES, AND BACK AGAIN,
AND ONLY ONCE; BESIDES BEING IN DIFFERENT PLACES ABOUT HOME:
CORK, AND LISBON, AND GIBRALTAR.  BUT I NEVER WENT BEYOND THE STREIGHTS,
AND NEVER WAS IN THE WEST INDIES.  WE DO NOT CALL BERMUDA OR BAHAMA,
YOU KNOW, THE WEST INDIES."

MRS MUSGROVE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY IN DISSENT; SHE COULD NOT ACCUSE HERSELF
OF HAVING EVER CALLED THEM ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HER LIFE.

"AND I DO ASSURE YOU, MA'AM," PURSUED MRS CROFT, "THAT NOTHING CAN EXCEED
THE ACCOMMODATIONS OF A MAN-OF-WAR; I SPEAK, YOU KNOW, OF THE HIGHER RATES.
WHEN YOU COME TO A FRIGATE, OF COURSE, YOU ARE MORE CONFINED;
THOUGH ANY REASONABLE WOMAN MAY BE PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ONE OF THEM;
AND I CAN SAFELY SAY, THAT THE HAPPIEST PART OF MY LIFE HAS BEEN SPENT
ON BOARD A SHIP.  WHILE WE WERE TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NOTHING
TO BE FEARED.  THANK GOD!  I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BLESSED WITH
EXCELLENT HEALTH, AND NO CLIMATE DISAGREES WITH ME.  A LITTLE DISORDERED
ALWAYS THE FIRST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF GOING TO SEA, BUT NEVER KNEW
WHAT SICKNESS WAS AFTERWARDS.  THE ONLY TIME I EVER REALLY SUFFERED
IN BODY OR MIND, THE ONLY TIME THAT I EVER FANCIED MYSELF UNWELL,
OR HAD ANY IDEAS OF DANGER, WAS THE WINTER THAT I PASSED BY MYSELF AT DEAL,
WHEN THE ADMIRAL (CAPTAIN CROFT THEN) WAS IN THE NORTH SEAS.
I LIVED IN PERPETUAL FRIGHT AT THAT TIME, AND HAD ALL MANNER OF
IMAGINARY COMPLAINTS FROM NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF,
OR WHEN I SHOULD HEAR FROM HIM NEXT; BUT AS LONG AS WE COULD BE TOGETHER,
NOTHING EVER AILED ME, AND I NEVER MET WITH THE SMALLEST INCONVENIENCE."

"AYE, TO BE SURE.  YES, INDEED, OH YES!  I AM QUITE OF YOUR OPINION,
MRS CROFT," WAS MRS MUSGROVE'S HEARTY ANSWER.  "THERE IS NOTHING SO BAD
AS A SEPARATION.  I AM QUITE OF YOUR OPINION.  I KNOW WHAT IT IS,
FOR MR MUSGROVE ALWAYS ATTENDS THE ASSIZES, AND I AM SO GLAD WHEN
THEY ARE OVER, AND HE IS SAFE BACK AGAIN."

THE EVENING ENDED WITH DANCING.  ON ITS BEING PROPOSED,
ANNE OFFERED HER SERVICES, AS USUAL; AND THOUGH HER EYES WOULD SOMETIMES
FILL WITH TEARS AS SHE SAT AT THE INSTRUMENT, SHE WAS EXTREMELY GLAD
TO BE EMPLOYED, AND DESIRED NOTHING IN RETURN BUT TO BE UNOBSERVED.

IT WAS A MERRY, JOYOUS PARTY, AND NO ONE SEEMED IN HIGHER SPIRITS
THAN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  SHE FELT THAT HE HAD EVERY THING TO ELEVATE
HIM WHICH GENERAL ATTENTION AND DEFERENCE, AND ESPECIALLY THE ATTENTION
OF ALL THE YOUNG WOMEN, COULD DO.  THE MISS HAYTERS, THE FEMALES
OF THE FAMILY OF COUSINS ALREADY MENTIONED, WERE APPARENTLY ADMITTED
TO THE HONOUR OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM; AND AS FOR HENRIETTA AND LOUISA,
THEY BOTH SEEMED SO ENTIRELY OCCUPIED BY HIM, THAT NOTHING BUT
THE CONTINUED APPEARANCE OF THE MOST PERFECT GOOD-WILL BETWEEN THEMSELVES
COULD HAVE MADE IT CREDIBLE THAT THEY WERE NOT DECIDED RIVALS.
IF HE WERE A LITTLE SPOILT BY SUCH UNIVERSAL, SUCH EAGER ADMIRATION,
WHO COULD WONDER?

THESE WERE SOME OF THE THOUGHTS WHICH OCCUPIED ANNE, WHILE HER FINGERS
WERE MECHANICALLY AT WORK, PROCEEDING FOR HALF AN HOUR TOGETHER,
EQUALLY WITHOUT ERROR, AND WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS.  ONCE SHE FELT
THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT HERSELF,  OBSERVING HER ALTERED FEATURES,
PERHAPS, TRYING TO TRACE IN THEM THE RUINS OF THE FACE WHICH HAD ONCE
CHARMED HIM; AND ONCE SHE KNEW THAT HE MUST HAVE SPOKEN OF HER;
SHE WAS HARDLY AWARE OF IT, TILL SHE HEARD THE ANSWER; BUT THEN SHE WAS
SURE OF HIS HAVING ASKED HIS PARTNER WHETHER MISS ELLIOT NEVER DANCED?
THE ANSWER WAS, "OH, NO; NEVER; SHE HAS QUITE GIVEN UP DANCING.
SHE HAD RATHER PLAY.  SHE IS NEVER TIRED OF PLAYING."  ONCE, TOO,
HE SPOKE TO HER.  SHE HAD LEFT THE INSTRUMENT ON THE DANCING BEING OVER,
AND HE HAD SAT DOWN TO TRY TO MAKE OUT AN AIR WHICH HE WISHED
TO GIVE THE MISS MUSGROVES AN IDEA OF.  UNINTENTIONALLY SHE RETURNED
TO THAT PART OF THE ROOM; HE SAW HER, AND, INSTANTLY RISING,
SAID, WITH STUDIED POLITENESS--

"I BEG YOUR PARDON, MADAM, THIS IS YOUR SEAT;" AND THOUGH SHE IMMEDIATELY
DREW BACK WITH A DECIDED NEGATIVE, HE WAS NOT TO BE INDUCED
TO SIT DOWN AGAIN.

ANNE DID NOT WISH FOR MORE OF SUCH LOOKS AND SPEECHES.
HIS COLD POLITENESS, HIS CEREMONIOUS GRACE, WERE WORSE THAN ANYTHING.



CHAPTER 9


CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS COME TO KELLYNCH AS TO A HOME, TO STAY
AS LONG AS HE LIKED, BEING AS THOROUGHLY THE OBJECT OF
THE ADMIRAL'S FRATERNAL KINDNESS AS OF HIS WIFE'S.  HE HAD INTENDED,
ON FIRST ARRIVING, TO PROCEED VERY SOON INTO SHROPSHIRE,
AND VISIT THE BROTHER SETTLED IN THAT COUNTRY, BUT THE ATTRACTIONS
OF UPPERCROSS INDUCED HIM TO PUT THIS OFF.  THERE WAS SO MUCH
OF FRIENDLINESS, AND OF FLATTERY, AND OF EVERYTHING MOST BEWITCHING
IN HIS RECEPTION THERE; THE OLD WERE SO HOSPITABLE, THE YOUNG SO AGREEABLE,
THAT HE COULD NOT BUT RESOLVE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS, AND TAKE ALL
THE CHARMS AND PERFECTIONS OF EDWARD'S WIFE UPON CREDIT A LITTLE LONGER.

IT WAS SOON UPPERCROSS WITH HIM ALMOST EVERY DAY.  THE MUSGROVES
COULD HARDLY BE MORE READY TO INVITE THAN HE TO COME, PARTICULARLY
IN THE MORNING, WHEN HE HAD NO COMPANION AT HOME, FOR THE ADMIRAL
AND MRS CROFT WERE GENERALLY OUT OF DOORS TOGETHER, INTERESTING THEMSELVES
IN THEIR NEW POSSESSIONS, THEIR GRASS, AND THEIR SHEEP, AND DAWDLING ABOUT
IN A WAY NOT ENDURABLE TO A THIRD PERSON, OR DRIVING OUT IN A GIG,
LATELY ADDED TO THEIR ESTABLISHMENT.

HITHERTO THERE HAD BEEN BUT ONE OPINION OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
AMONG THE MUSGROVES AND THEIR DEPENDENCIES.  IT WAS UNVARYING,
WARM ADMIRATION EVERYWHERE; BUT THIS INTIMATE FOOTING WAS NOT MORE
THAN ESTABLISHED, WHEN A CERTAIN CHARLES HAYTER RETURNED AMONG THEM,
TO BE A GOOD DEAL DISTURBED BY IT, AND TO THINK CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
VERY MUCH IN THE WAY.

CHARLES HAYTER WAS THE ELDEST OF ALL THE COUSINS, AND A VERY AMIABLE,
PLEASING YOUNG MAN, BETWEEN WHOM AND HENRIETTA THERE HAD BEEN
A CONSIDERABLE APPEARANCE OF ATTACHMENT PREVIOUS TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S
INTRODUCTION.  HE WAS IN ORDERS; AND HAVING A CURACY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD,
WHERE RESIDENCE WAS NOT REQUIRED, LIVED AT HIS FATHER'S HOUSE,
ONLY TWO MILES FROM UPPERCROSS.  A SHORT ABSENCE FROM HOME
HAD LEFT HIS FAIR ONE UNGUARDED BY HIS ATTENTIONS AT THIS CRITICAL PERIOD,
AND WHEN HE CAME BACK HE HAD THE PAIN OF FINDING VERY ALTERED MANNERS,
AND OF SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.

MRS MUSGROVE AND MRS HAYTER WERE SISTERS.  THEY HAD EACH HAD MONEY,
BUT THEIR MARRIAGES HAD MADE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE IN
THEIR DEGREE OF CONSEQUENCE.  MR HAYTER HAD SOME PROPERTY OF HIS OWN,
BUT IT WAS INSIGNIFICANT COMPARED WITH MR MUSGROVE'S; AND WHILE
THE MUSGROVES WERE IN THE FIRST CLASS OF SOCIETY IN THE COUNTRY,
THE YOUNG HAYTERS WOULD, FROM THEIR PARENTS' INFERIOR, RETIRED,
AND UNPOLISHED WAY OF LIVING, AND THEIR OWN DEFECTIVE EDUCATION,
HAVE BEEN HARDLY IN ANY CLASS AT ALL, BUT FOR THEIR CONNEXION
WITH UPPERCROSS, THIS ELDEST SON OF COURSE EXCEPTED, WHO HAD CHOSEN
TO BE A SCHOLAR AND A GENTLEMAN, AND WHO WAS VERY SUPERIOR
IN CULTIVATION AND MANNERS TO ALL THE REST.

THE TWO FAMILIES HAD ALWAYS BEEN ON EXCELLENT TERMS, THERE BEING NO PRIDE
ON ONE SIDE, AND NO ENVY ON THE OTHER, AND ONLY SUCH A CONSCIOUSNESS
OF SUPERIORITY IN THE MISS MUSGROVES, AS MADE THEM PLEASED
TO IMPROVE THEIR COUSINS.  CHARLES'S ATTENTIONS TO HENRIETTA
HAD BEEN OBSERVED BY HER FATHER AND MOTHER WITHOUT ANY DISAPPROBATION.
"IT WOULD NOT BE A GREAT MATCH FOR HER; BUT IF HENRIETTA LIKED HIM,"--
AND HENRIETTA DID SEEM TO LIKE HIM.

HENRIETTA FULLY THOUGHT SO HERSELF, BEFORE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH CAME;
BUT FROM THAT TIME COUSIN CHARLES HAD BEEN VERY MUCH FORGOTTEN.

WHICH OF THE TWO SISTERS WAS PREFERRED BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS
AS YET QUITE DOUBTFUL, AS FAR AS ANNE'S OBSERVATION REACHED.
HENRIETTA WAS PERHAPS THE PRETTIEST, LOUISA HAD THE HIGHER SPIRITS;
AND SHE KNEW NOT NOW, WHETHER THE MORE GENTLE OR THE MORE LIVELY CHARACTER
WERE MOST LIKELY TO ATTRACT HIM.

MR AND MRS MUSGROVE, EITHER FROM SEEING LITTLE, OR FROM
AN ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN THE DISCRETION OF BOTH THEIR DAUGHTERS,
AND OF ALL THE YOUNG MEN WHO CAME NEAR THEM, SEEMED TO LEAVE EVERYTHING
TO TAKE ITS CHANCE.  THERE WAS NOT THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF SOLICITUDE
OR REMARK ABOUT THEM IN THE MANSION-HOUSE; BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT
AT THE COTTAGE:  THE YOUNG COUPLE THERE WERE MORE DISPOSED
TO SPECULATE AND WONDER; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD NOT BEEN ABOVE
FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN THE MISS MUSGROVES' COMPANY, AND CHARLES HAYTER
HAD BUT JUST REAPPEARED, WHEN ANNE HAD TO LISTEN TO THE OPINIONS
OF HER BROTHER AND SISTER, AS TO WHICH WAS THE ONE LIKED BEST.
CHARLES GAVE IT FOR LOUISA, MARY FOR HENRIETTA, BUT QUITE AGREEING
THAT TO HAVE HIM MARRY EITHER COULD BE EXTREMELY DELIGHTFUL.

CHARLES "HAD NEVER SEEN A PLEASANTER MAN IN HIS LIFE; AND FROM WHAT
HE HAD ONCE HEARD CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HIMSELF SAY, WAS VERY SURE THAT
HE HAD NOT MADE LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS BY THE WAR.
HERE WAS A FORTUNE AT ONCE; BESIDES WHICH, THERE WOULD BE THE CHANCE
OF WHAT MIGHT BE DONE IN ANY FUTURE WAR; AND HE WAS SURE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
WAS AS LIKELY A MAN TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF AS ANY OFFICER IN THE NAVY.
OH! IT WOULD BE A CAPITAL MATCH FOR EITHER OF HIS SISTERS."

"UPON MY WORD IT WOULD," REPLIED MARY.  "DEAR ME!  IF HE SHOULD
RISE TO ANY VERY GREAT HONOURS!  IF HE SHOULD EVER BE MADE A BARONET!
`LADY WENTWORTH' SOUNDS VERY WELL.  THAT WOULD BE A NOBLE THING,
INDEED, FOR HENRIETTA!  SHE WOULD TAKE PLACE OF ME THEN, AND HENRIETTA
WOULD NOT DISLIKE THAT.  SIR FREDERICK AND LADY WENTWORTH!
IT WOULD BE BUT A NEW CREATION, HOWEVER, AND I NEVER THINK MUCH
OF YOUR NEW CREATIONS."

IT SUITED MARY BEST TO THINK HENRIETTA THE ONE PREFERRED
ON THE VERY ACCOUNT OF CHARLES HAYTER, WHOSE PRETENSIONS SHE WISHED
TO SEE PUT AN END TO.  SHE LOOKED DOWN VERY DECIDEDLY UPON THE HAYTERS,
AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE QUITE A MISFORTUNE TO HAVE THE EXISTING CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE FAMILIES RENEWED--VERY SAD FOR HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN.

"YOU KNOW," SAID SHE, "I CANNOT THINK HIM AT ALL A FIT MATCH FOR HENRIETTA;
AND CONSIDERING THE ALLIANCES WHICH THE MUSGROVES HAVE MADE,
SHE HAS NO RIGHT TO THROW HERSELF AWAY.  I DO NOT THINK ANY YOUNG WOMAN
HAS A RIGHT TO MAKE A CHOICE THAT MAY BE DISAGREEABLE AND INCONVENIENT
TO THE PRINCIPAL PART OF HER FAMILY, AND BE GIVING BAD CONNECTIONS
TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN USED TO THEM.  AND, PRAY, WHO IS CHARLES HAYTER?
NOTHING BUT A COUNTRY CURATE.  A MOST IMPROPER MATCH FOR MISS MUSGROVE
OF UPPERCROSS."

HER HUSBAND, HOWEVER, WOULD NOT AGREE WITH HER HERE; FOR BESIDES HAVING
A REGARD FOR HIS COUSIN, CHARLES HAYTER WAS AN ELDEST SON,
AND HE SAW THINGS AS AN ELDEST SON HIMSELF.

"NOW YOU ARE TAKING NONSENSE, MARY," WAS THEREFORE HIS ANSWER.
"IT WOULD NOT BE A GREAT MATCH FOR HENRIETTA, BUT CHARLES HAS
A VERY FAIR CHANCE, THROUGH THE SPICERS, OF GETTING SOMETHING FROM
THE BISHOP IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR OR TWO; AND YOU WILL PLEASE TO REMEMBER,
THAT HE IS THE ELDEST SON; WHENEVER MY UNCLE DIES, HE STEPS INTO VERY
PRETTY PROPERTY.  THE ESTATE AT WINTHROP IS NOT LESS THAN
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACRES, BESIDES THE FARM NEAR TAUNTON,
WHICH IS SOME OF THE BEST LAND IN THE COUNTRY.  I GRANT YOU,
THAT ANY OF THEM BUT CHARLES WOULD BE A VERY SHOCKING MATCH FOR HENRIETTA,
AND INDEED IT COULD NOT BE; HE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE;
BUT HE IS A VERY GOOD-NATURED, GOOD SORT OF A FELLOW; AND WHENEVER WINTHROP
COMES INTO HIS HANDS, HE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENT SORT OF PLACE OF IT,
AND LIVE IN A VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF WAY; AND WITH THAT PROPERTY,
HE WILL NEVER BE A CONTEMPTIBLE MAN--GOOD, FREEHOLD PROPERTY.  NO, NO;
HENRIETTA MIGHT DO WORSE THAN MARRY CHARLES HAYTER; AND IF SHE HAS HIM,
AND LOUISA CAN GET CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, I SHALL BE VERY WELL SATISFIED."

"CHARLES MAY SAY WHAT HE PLEASES," CRIED MARY TO ANNE, AS SOON AS
HE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM, "BUT IT WOULD BE SHOCKING TO HAVE HENRIETTA
MARRY CHARLES HAYTER; A VERY BAD THING FOR HER, AND STILL WORSE
FOR ME; AND THEREFORE IT IS VERY MUCH TO BE WISHED THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
MAY SOON PUT HIM QUITE OUT OF HER HEAD, AND I HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT
THAT HE HAS.  SHE TOOK HARDLY ANY NOTICE OF CHARLES HAYTER YESTERDAY.
I WISH YOU HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE HER BEHAVIOUR.  AND AS TO
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S LIKING LOUISA AS WELL AS HENRIETTA, IT IS NONSENSE
TO SAY SO; FOR HE CERTAINLY DOES LIKE HENRIETTA A GREAT DEAL THE BEST.
BUT CHARLES IS SO POSITIVE!  I WISH YOU HAD BEEN WITH US YESTERDAY,
FOR THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE DECIDED BETWEEN US; AND I AM SURE YOU
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AS I DID, UNLESS YOU HAD BEEN DETERMINED
TO GIVE IT AGAINST ME."

A DINNER AT MR MUSGROVE'S HAD BEEN THE OCCASION WHEN ALL THESE THINGS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY ANNE; BUT SHE HAD STAID AT HOME,
UNDER THE MIXED PLEA OF A HEADACHE OF HER OWN, AND SOME RETURN
OF INDISPOSITION IN LITTLE CHARLES.  SHE HAD THOUGHT ONLY OF AVOIDING
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH; BUT AN ESCAPE FROM BEING APPEALED TO AS UMPIRE
WAS NOW ADDED TO THE ADVANTAGES OF A QUIET EVENING.

AS TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S VIEWS, SHE DEEMED IT OF MORE CONSEQUENCE
THAT HE SHOULD KNOW HIS OWN MIND EARLY ENOUGH NOT TO BE ENDANGERING
THE HAPPINESS OF EITHER SISTER, OR IMPEACHING HIS OWN HONOUR,
THAN THAT HE SHOULD PREFER HENRIETTA TO LOUISA, OR LOUISA TO HENRIETTA.
EITHER OF THEM WOULD, IN ALL PROBABILITY, MAKE HIM AN AFFECTIONATE,
GOOD-HUMOURED WIFE.  WITH REGARD TO CHARLES HAYTER, SHE HAD DELICACY
WHICH MUST BE PAINED BY ANY LIGHTNESS OF CONDUCT IN A WELL-MEANING
YOUNG WOMAN, AND A HEART TO SYMPATHIZE IN ANY OF THE SUFFERINGS
IT OCCASIONED; BUT IF HENRIETTA FOUND HERSELF MISTAKEN IN THE NATURE
OF HER FEELINGS, THE ALTERNATION COULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD TOO SOON.

CHARLES HAYTER HAD MET WITH MUCH TO DISQUIET AND MORTIFY HIM
IN HIS COUSIN'S BEHAVIOUR.  SHE HAD TOO OLD A REGARD FOR HIM
TO BE SO WHOLLY ESTRANGED AS MIGHT IN TWO MEETINGS EXTINGUISH
EVERY PAST HOPE, AND LEAVE HIM NOTHING TO DO BUT TO KEEP AWAY
FROM UPPERCROSS:  BUT THERE WAS SUCH A CHANGE AS BECAME VERY ALARMING,
WHEN SUCH A MAN AS CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS TO BE REGARDED AS
THE PROBABLE CAUSE.  HE HAD BEEN ABSENT ONLY TWO SUNDAYS,
AND WHEN THEY PARTED, HAD LEFT HER INTERESTED, EVEN TO THE HEIGHT
OF HIS WISHES, IN HIS PROSPECT OF SOON QUITTING HIS PRESENT CURACY,
AND OBTAINING THAT OF UPPERCROSS INSTEAD.  IT HAD THEN SEEMED THE OBJECT
NEAREST HER HEART, THAT DR SHIRLEY, THE RECTOR, WHO FOR MORE THAN
FORTY YEARS HAD BEEN ZEALOUSLY DISCHARGING ALL THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE,
BUT WAS NOW GROWING TOO INFIRM FOR MANY OF THEM, SHOULD BE QUITE FIXED
ON ENGAGING A CURATE; SHOULD MAKE HIS CURACY QUITE AS GOOD
AS HE COULD AFFORD, AND SHOULD GIVE CHARLES HAYTER THE PROMISE OF IT.
THE ADVANTAGE OF HIS HAVING TO COME ONLY TO UPPERCROSS, INSTEAD OF GOING
SIX MILES ANOTHER WAY; OF HIS HAVING, IN EVERY RESPECT, A BETTER CURACY;
OF HIS BELONGING TO THEIR DEAR DR SHIRLEY, AND OF DEAR, GOOD DR SHIRLEY'S
BEING RELIEVED FROM THE DUTY WHICH HE COULD NO LONGER GET THROUGH
WITHOUT MOST INJURIOUS FATIGUE, HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL, EVEN TO LOUISA,
BUT HAD BEEN ALMOST EVERYTHING TO HENRIETTA.  WHEN HE CAME BACK, ALAS!
THE ZEAL OF THE BUSINESS WAS GONE BY.  LOUISA COULD NOT LISTEN AT ALL
TO HIS ACCOUNT OF A CONVERSATION WHICH HE HAD JUST HELD WITH DR SHIRLEY:
SHE WAS AT A WINDOW, LOOKING OUT FOR CAPTAIN WENTWORTH; AND EVEN HENRIETTA
HAD AT BEST ONLY A DIVIDED ATTENTION TO GIVE, AND SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN
ALL THE FORMER DOUBT AND SOLICITUDE OF THE NEGOTIATION.

"WELL, I AM VERY GLAD INDEED:  BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE IT;
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU SURE.  IT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT--IN SHORT,
YOU KNOW, DR SHIRLEY MUST HAVE A CURATE, AND YOU HAD SECURED HIS PROMISE.
IS HE COMING, LOUISA?"

ONE MORNING, VERY SOON AFTER THE DINNER AT THE MUSGROVES,
AT WHICH ANNE HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKED INTO
THE DRAWING-ROOM AT THE COTTAGE, WHERE WERE ONLY HERSELF AND THE LITTLE
INVALID CHARLES, WHO WAS LYING ON THE SOFA.

THE SURPRISE OF FINDING HIMSELF ALMOST ALONE WITH ANNE ELLIOT,
DEPRIVED HIS MANNERS OF THEIR USUAL COMPOSURE:  HE STARTED,
AND COULD ONLY SAY, "I THOUGHT THE MISS MUSGROVES HAD BEEN HERE:
MRS MUSGROVE TOLD ME I SHOULD FIND THEM HERE," BEFORE HE WALKED
TO THE WINDOW TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF, AND FEEL HOW HE OUGHT TO BEHAVE.

"THEY ARE UP STAIRS WITH MY SISTER:  THEY WILL BE DOWN IN A FEW MOMENTS,
I DARE SAY," HAD BEEN ANNE'S REPLY, IN ALL THE CONFUSION THAT WAS NATURAL;
AND IF THE CHILD HAD NOT CALLED HER TO COME AND DO SOMETHING FOR HIM,
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE ROOM THE NEXT MOMENT, AND RELEASED
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AS WELL AS HERSELF.

HE CONTINUED AT THE WINDOW; AND AFTER CALMLY AND POLITELY SAYING,
"I HOPE THE LITTLE BOY IS BETTER," WAS SILENT.

SHE WAS OBLIGED TO KNEEL DOWN BY THE SOFA, AND REMAIN THERE
TO SATISFY HER PATIENT; AND THUS THEY CONTINUED A FEW MINUTES,
WHEN, TO HER VERY GREAT SATISFACTION, SHE HEARD SOME OTHER PERSON
CROSSING THE LITTLE VESTIBULE.  SHE HOPED, ON TURNING HER HEAD,
TO SEE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE; BUT IT PROVED TO BE ONE
MUCH LESS CALCULATED FOR MAKING MATTERS EASY--CHARLES HAYTER,
PROBABLY NOT AT ALL BETTER PLEASED BY THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
THAN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD BEEN BY THE SIGHT OF ANNE.

SHE ONLY ATTEMPTED TO SAY, "HOW DO YOU DO?  WILL YOU NOT SIT DOWN?
THE OTHERS WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY."

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, HOWEVER, CAME FROM HIS WINDOW, APPARENTLY
NOT ILL-DISPOSED FOR CONVERSATION; BUT CHARLES HAYTER SOON PUT AN END
TO HIS ATTEMPTS BY SEATING HIMSELF NEAR THE TABLE, AND TAKING UP
THE NEWSPAPER; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH RETURNED TO HIS WINDOW.

ANOTHER MINUTE BROUGHT ANOTHER ADDITION.  THE YOUNGER BOY,
A REMARKABLE STOUT, FORWARD CHILD, OF TWO YEARS OLD, HAVING GOT THE DOOR
OPENED FOR HIM BY SOME ONE WITHOUT, MADE HIS DETERMINED APPEARANCE
AMONG THEM, AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE SOFA TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON,
AND PUT IN HIS CLAIM TO ANYTHING GOOD THAT MIGHT BE GIVING AWAY.

THERE BEING NOTHING TO EAT, HE COULD ONLY HAVE SOME PLAY;
AND AS HIS AUNT WOULD NOT LET HIM TEASE HIS SICK BROTHER,
HE BEGAN TO FASTEN HIMSELF UPON HER, AS SHE KNELT, IN SUCH A WAY THAT,
BUSY AS SHE WAS ABOUT CHARLES, SHE COULD NOT SHAKE HIM OFF.
SHE SPOKE TO HIM, ORDERED, ENTREATED, AND INSISTED IN VAIN.
ONCE SHE DID CONTRIVE TO PUSH HIM AWAY, BUT THE BOY HAD
THE GREATER PLEASURE IN GETTING UPON HER BACK AGAIN DIRECTLY.

"WALTER," SAID SHE, "GET DOWN THIS MOMENT.  YOU ARE EXTREMELY TROUBLESOME.
I AM VERY ANGRY WITH YOU."

"WALTER," CRIED CHARLES HAYTER, "WHY DO YOU NOT DO AS YOU ARE BID?
DO NOT YOU HEAR YOUR AUNT SPEAK?  COME TO ME, WALTER, COME TO
COUSIN CHARLES."

BUT NOT A BIT DID WALTER STIR.

IN ANOTHER MOMENT, HOWEVER, SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE STATE OF
BEING RELEASED FROM HIM; SOME ONE WAS TAKING HIM FROM HER,
THOUGH HE HAD BENT DOWN HER HEAD SO MUCH, THAT HIS LITTLE STURDY HANDS
WERE UNFASTENED FROM AROUND HER NECK, AND HE WAS RESOLUTELY BORNE AWAY,
BEFORE SHE KNEW THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD DONE IT.

HER SENSATIONS ON THE DISCOVERY MADE HER PERFECTLY SPEECHLESS.
SHE COULD NOT EVEN THANK HIM.  SHE COULD ONLY HANG OVER LITTLE CHARLES,
WITH MOST DISORDERED FEELINGS.  HIS KINDNESS IN STEPPING FORWARD
TO HER RELIEF, THE MANNER, THE SILENCE IN WHICH IT HAD PASSED,
THE LITTLE PARTICULARS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE, WITH THE CONVICTION SOON
FORCED ON HER BY THE NOISE HE WAS STUDIOUSLY MAKING WITH THE CHILD,
THAT HE MEANT TO AVOID HEARING HER THANKS, AND RATHER SOUGHT
TO TESTIFY THAT HER CONVERSATION WAS THE LAST OF HIS WANTS,
PRODUCED SUCH A CONFUSION OF VARYING, BUT VERY PAINFUL AGITATION,
AS SHE COULD NOT RECOVER FROM, TILL ENABLED BY THE ENTRANCE OF MARY
AND THE MISS MUSGROVES TO MAKE OVER HER LITTLE PATIENT TO THEIR CARES,
AND LEAVE THE ROOM.  SHE COULD NOT STAY.  IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AN OPPORTUNITY OF WATCHING THE LOVES AND JEALOUSIES OF THE FOUR--
THEY WERE NOW ALTOGETHER; BUT SHE COULD STAY FOR NONE OF IT.
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT CHARLES HAYTER WAS NOT WELL INCLINED TOWARDS
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  SHE HAD A STRONG IMPRESSION OF HIS HAVING SAID,
IN A VEXT TONE OF VOICE, AFTER CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S INTERFERENCE,
"YOU OUGHT TO HAVE MINDED ME, WALTER; I TOLD YOU NOT TO TEAZE YOUR AUNT;"
AND COULD COMPREHEND HIS REGRETTING THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SHOULD DO
WHAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE HIMSELF.  BUT NEITHER CHARLES HAYTER'S FEELINGS,
NOR ANYBODY'S FEELINGS, COULD INTEREST HER, TILL SHE HAD A LITTLE BETTER
ARRANGED HER OWN.  SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HERSELF, QUITE ASHAMED
OF BEING SO NERVOUS, SO OVERCOME BY SUCH A TRIFLE; BUT SO IT WAS,
AND IT REQUIRED A LONG APPLICATION OF SOLITUDE AND REFLECTION
TO RECOVER HER.



CHAPTER 10


OTHER OPPORTUNITIES OF MAKING HER OBSERVATIONS COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCUR.
ANNE HAD SOON BEEN IN COMPANY WITH ALL THE FOUR TOGETHER OFTEN ENOUGH
TO HAVE AN OPINION, THOUGH TOO WISE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS MUCH AT HOME,
WHERE SHE KNEW IT WOULD HAVE SATISFIED NEITHER HUSBAND NOR WIFE;
FOR WHILE SHE CONSIDERED LOUISA TO BE RATHER THE FAVOURITE,
SHE COULD NOT BUT THINK, AS FAR AS SHE MIGHT DARE TO JUDGE FROM MEMORY
AND EXPERIENCE, THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH EITHER.
THEY WERE MORE IN LOVE WITH HIM; YET THERE IT WAS NOT LOVE.
IT WAS A LITTLE FEVER OF ADMIRATION; BUT IT MIGHT, PROBABLY MUST,
END IN LOVE WITH SOME.  CHARLES HAYTER SEEMED AWARE OF BEING SLIGHTED,
AND YET HENRIETTA HAD SOMETIMES THE AIR OF BEING DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM.
ANNE LONGED FOR THE POWER OF REPRESENTING TO THEM ALL WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT,
AND OF POINTING OUT SOME OF THE EVILS THEY WERE EXPOSING THEMSELVES TO.
SHE DID NOT ATTRIBUTE GUILE TO ANY.  IT WAS THE HIGHEST SATISFACTION
TO HER TO BELIEVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NOT IN THE LEAST AWARE
OF THE PAIN HE WAS OCCASIONING.  THERE WAS NO TRIUMPH, NO PITIFUL TRIUMPH
IN HIS MANNER.  HE HAD, PROBABLY, NEVER HEARD, AND NEVER THOUGHT OF
ANY CLAIMS OF CHARLES HAYTER.  HE WAS ONLY WRONG IN ACCEPTING
THE ATTENTIONS (FOR ACCEPTING MUST BE THE WORD) OF TWO YOUNG WOMEN AT ONCE.

AFTER A SHORT STRUGGLE, HOWEVER, CHARLES HAYTER SEEMED TO QUIT THE FIELD.
THREE DAYS HAD PASSED WITHOUT HIS COMING ONCE TO UPPERCROSS;
A MOST DECIDED CHANGE.  HE HAD EVEN REFUSED ONE REGULAR INVITATION TO DINNER;
AND HAVING BEEN FOUND ON THE OCCASION BY MR MUSGROVE WITH SOME LARGE BOOKS
BEFORE HIM, MR AND MRS MUSGROVE WERE SURE ALL COULD NOT BE RIGHT,
AND TALKED, WITH GRAVE FACES, OF HIS STUDYING HIMSELF TO DEATH.
IT WAS MARY'S HOPE AND BELIEF THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A POSITIVE DISMISSAL
FROM HENRIETTA, AND HER HUSBAND LIVED UNDER THE CONSTANT DEPENDENCE
OF SEEING HIM TO-MORROW.  ANNE COULD ONLY FEEL THAT CHARLES HAYTER
WAS WISE.

ONE MORNING, ABOUT THIS TIME CHARLES MUSGROVE AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
BEING GONE A-SHOOTING TOGETHER, AS THE SISTERS IN THE COTTAGE
WERE SITTING QUIETLY AT WORK, THEY WERE VISITED AT THE WINDOW
BY THE SISTERS FROM THE MANSION-HOUSE.

IT WAS A VERY FINE NOVEMBER DAY, AND THE MISS MUSGROVES CAME
THROUGH THE LITTLE GROUNDS, AND STOPPED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO SAY,
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE A LONG WALK, AND THEREFORE CONCLUDED
MARY COULD NOT LIKE TO GO WITH THEM; AND WHEN MARY IMMEDIATELY REPLIED,
WITH SOME JEALOUSY AT NOT BEING SUPPOSED A GOOD WALKER, "OH, YES,
I SHOULD LIKE TO JOIN YOU VERY MUCH, I AM VERY FOND OF A LONG WALK;"
ANNE FELT PERSUADED, BY THE LOOKS OF THE TWO GIRLS, THAT IT WAS PRECISELY
WHAT THEY DID NOT WISH, AND ADMIRED AGAIN THE SORT OF NECESSITY
WHICH THE FAMILY HABITS SEEMED TO PRODUCE, OF EVERYTHING BEING
TO BE COMMUNICATED, AND EVERYTHING BEING TO BE DONE TOGETHER,
HOWEVER UNDESIRED AND INCONVENIENT.  SHE TRIED TO DISSUADE MARY FROM GOING,
BUT IN VAIN; AND THAT BEING THE CASE, THOUGHT IT BEST TO ACCEPT
THE MISS MUSGROVES' MUCH MORE CORDIAL INVITATION TO HERSELF TO GO LIKEWISE,
AS SHE MIGHT BE USEFUL IN TURNING BACK WITH HER SISTER, AND LESSENING
THE INTERFERENCE IN ANY PLAN OF THEIR OWN.

"I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY THEY SHOULD SUPPOSE I SHOULD NOT LIKE A LONG WALK,"
SAID MARY, AS SHE WENT UP STAIRS.  "EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS SUPPOSING
THAT I AM NOT A GOOD WALKER; AND YET THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PLEASED,
IF WE HAD REFUSED TO JOIN THEM.  WHEN PEOPLE COME IN THIS MANNER
ON PURPOSE TO ASK US, HOW CAN ONE SAY NO?"

JUST AS THEY WERE SETTING OFF, THE GENTLEMEN RETURNED.  THEY HAD TAKEN OUT
A YOUNG DOG, WHO HAD SPOILT THEIR SPORT, AND SENT THEM BACK EARLY.
THEIR TIME AND STRENGTH, AND SPIRITS, WERE, THEREFORE, EXACTLY READY
FOR THIS WALK, AND THEY ENTERED INTO IT WITH PLEASURE.  COULD ANNE
HAVE FORESEEN SUCH A JUNCTION, SHE WOULD HAVE STAID AT HOME; BUT,
FROM SOME FEELINGS OF INTEREST AND CURIOSITY, SHE FANCIED NOW THAT IT WAS
TOO LATE TO RETRACT, AND THE WHOLE SIX SET FORWARD TOGETHER
IN THE DIRECTION CHOSEN BY THE MISS MUSGROVES, WHO EVIDENTLY
CONSIDERED THE WALK AS UNDER THEIR GUIDANCE.

ANNE'S OBJECT WAS, NOT TO BE IN THE WAY OF ANYBODY; AND WHERE
THE NARROW PATHS ACROSS THE FIELDS MADE MANY SEPARATIONS NECESSARY,
TO KEEP WITH HER BROTHER AND SISTER.  HER PLEASURE IN THE WALK
MUST ARISE FROM THE EXERCISE AND THE DAY, FROM THE VIEW OF
THE LAST SMILES OF THE YEAR UPON THE TAWNY LEAVES, AND WITHERED HEDGES,
AND FROM REPEATING TO HERSELF SOME FEW OF THE THOUSAND POETICAL
DESCRIPTIONS EXTANT OF AUTUMN, THAT SEASON OF PECULIAR AND
INEXHAUSTIBLE INFLUENCE ON THE MIND OF TASTE AND TENDERNESS,
THAT SEASON WHICH HAD DRAWN FROM EVERY POET, WORTHY OF BEING READ,
SOME ATTEMPT AT DESCRIPTION, OR SOME LINES OF FEELING.
SHE OCCUPIED HER MIND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN SUCH LIKE MUSINGS
AND QUOTATIONS; BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE, THAT WHEN WITHIN REACH
OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S CONVERSATION WITH EITHER OF THE MISS MUSGROVES,
SHE SHOULD NOT TRY TO HEAR IT; YET SHE CAUGHT LITTLE VERY REMARKABLE.
IT WAS MERE LIVELY CHAT, SUCH AS ANY YOUNG PERSONS, ON AN INTIMATE FOOTING,
MIGHT FALL INTO.  HE WAS MORE ENGAGED WITH LOUISA THAN WITH HENRIETTA.
LOUISA CERTAINLY PUT MORE FORWARD FOR HIS NOTICE THAN HER SISTER.
THIS DISTINCTION APPEARED TO INCREASE, AND THERE WAS ONE SPEECH
OF LOUISA'S WHICH STRUCK HER.  AFTER ONE OF THE MANY PRAISES OF THE DAY,
WHICH WERE CONTINUALLY BURSTING FORTH, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH ADDED: --

"WHAT GLORIOUS WEATHER FOR THE ADMIRAL AND MY SISTER!  THEY MEANT TO TAKE
A LONG DRIVE THIS MORNING; PERHAPS WE MAY HAIL THEM FROM
SOME OF THESE HILLS.  THEY TALKED OF COMING INTO THIS SIDE OF THE COUNTRY.
I WONDER WHEREABOUTS THEY WILL UPSET TO-DAY.  OH! IT DOES HAPPEN
VERY OFTEN, I ASSURE YOU; BUT MY SISTER MAKES NOTHING OF IT;
SHE WOULD AS LIEVE BE TOSSED OUT AS NOT."

"AH! YOU MAKE THE MOST OF IT, I KNOW," CRIED LOUISA, "BUT IF IT WERE
REALLY SO, I SHOULD DO JUST THE SAME IN HER PLACE.  IF I LOVED A MAN,
AS SHE LOVES THE ADMIRAL, I WOULD ALWAYS BE WITH HIM, NOTHING SHOULD EVER
SEPARATE US, AND I WOULD RATHER BE OVERTURNED BY HIM, THAN DRIVEN SAFELY
BY ANYBODY ELSE."

IT WAS SPOKEN WITH ENTHUSIASM.

"HAD YOU?" CRIED HE, CATCHING THE SAME TONE; "I HONOUR YOU!"
AND THERE WAS SILENCE BETWEEN THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

ANNE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY FALL INTO A QUOTATION AGAIN.  THE SWEET SCENES
OF AUTUMN WERE FOR A WHILE PUT BY, UNLESS SOME TENDER SONNET,
FRAUGHT WITH THE APT ANALOGY OF THE DECLINING YEAR, WITH DECLINING
HAPPINESS, AND THE IMAGES OF YOUTH AND HOPE, AND SPRING, ALL GONE TOGETHER,
BLESSED HER MEMORY.  SHE ROUSED HERSELF TO SAY, AS THEY STRUCK BY ORDER
INTO ANOTHER PATH, "IS NOT THIS ONE OF THE WAYS TO WINTHROP?"
BUT NOBODY HEARD, OR, AT LEAST, NOBODY ANSWERED HER.

WINTHROP, HOWEVER, OR ITS ENVIRONS--FOR YOUNG MEN ARE, SOMETIMES
TO BE MET WITH, STROLLING ABOUT NEAR HOME--WAS THEIR DESTINATION;
AND AFTER ANOTHER HALF MILE OF GRADUAL ASCENT THROUGH LARGE ENCLOSURES,
WHERE THE PLOUGHS AT WORK, AND THE FRESH MADE PATH SPOKE THE FARMER
COUNTERACTING THE SWEETS OF POETICAL DESPONDENCE, AND MEANING
TO HAVE SPRING AGAIN, THEY GAINED THE SUMMIT OF THE MOST CONSIDERABLE HILL,
WHICH PARTED UPPERCROSS AND WINTHROP, AND SOON COMMANDED A FULL VIEW
OF THE LATTER, AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL ON THE OTHER SIDE.

WINTHROP, WITHOUT BEAUTY AND WITHOUT DIGNITY, WAS STRETCHED BEFORE THEM
AN INDIFFERENT HOUSE, STANDING LOW, AND HEMMED IN BY THE BARNS AND
BUILDINGS OF A FARM-YARD.

MARY EXCLAIMED, "BLESS ME! HERE IS WINTHROP.  I DECLARE I HAD NO IDEA!
WELL NOW, I THINK WE HAD BETTER TURN BACK; I AM EXCESSIVELY TIRED."

HENRIETTA, CONSCIOUS AND ASHAMED, AND SEEING NO COUSIN CHARLES
WALKING ALONG ANY PATH, OR LEANING AGAINST ANY GATE, WAS READY
TO DO AS MARY WISHED; BUT "NO!" SAID CHARLES MUSGROVE, AND "NO, NO!"
CRIED LOUISA MORE EAGERLY, AND TAKING HER SISTER ASIDE, SEEMED TO BE
ARGUING THE MATTER WARMLY.

CHARLES, IN THE MEANWHILE, WAS VERY DECIDEDLY DECLARING HIS RESOLUTION
OF CALLING ON HIS AUNT, NOW THAT HE WAS SO NEAR; AND VERY EVIDENTLY,
THOUGH MORE FEARFULLY, TRYING TO INDUCE HIS WIFE TO GO TOO.
BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THE POINTS ON WHICH THE LADY SHEWED HER STRENGTH;
AND WHEN HE RECOMMENDED THE ADVANTAGE OF RESTING HERSELF A QUARTER
OF AN HOUR AT WINTHROP, AS SHE FELT SO TIRED, SHE RESOLUTELY ANSWERED,
"OH! NO, INDEED! WALKING UP THAT HILL AGAIN WOULD DO HER MORE HARM
THAN ANY SITTING DOWN COULD DO HER GOOD;" AND, IN SHORT,
HER LOOK AND MANNER DECLARED, THAT GO SHE WOULD NOT.

AFTER A LITTLE SUCCESSION OF THESE SORT OF DEBATES AND CONSULTATIONS,
IT WAS SETTLED BETWEEN CHARLES AND HIS TWO SISTERS, THAT HE
AND HENRIETTA SHOULD JUST RUN DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES, TO SEE THEIR AUNT
AND COUSINS, WHILE THE REST OF THE PARTY WAITED FOR THEM AT THE TOP
OF THE HILL.  LOUISA SEEMED THE PRINCIPAL ARRANGER OF THE PLAN;
AND, AS SHE WENT A LITTLE WAY WITH THEM, DOWN THE HILL, STILL TALKING
TO HENRIETTA, MARY TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF LOOKING SCORNFULLY AROUND HER,
AND SAYING TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH--

"IT IS VERY UNPLEASANT, HAVING SUCH CONNEXIONS!  BUT, I ASSURE YOU,
I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE HOUSE ABOVE TWICE IN MY LIFE."

SHE RECEIVED NO OTHER ANSWER, THAN AN ARTIFICIAL, ASSENTING SMILE,
FOLLOWED BY A CONTEMPTUOUS GLANCE, AS HE TURNED AWAY, WHICH ANNE
PERFECTLY KNEW THE MEANING OF.

THE BROW OF THE HILL, WHERE THEY REMAINED, WAS A CHEERFUL SPOT:
LOUISA RETURNED; AND MARY, FINDING A COMFORTABLE SEAT FOR HERSELF
ON THE STEP OF A STILE, WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED SO LONG AS THE OTHERS
ALL STOOD ABOUT HER; BUT WHEN LOUISA DREW CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AWAY,
TO TRY FOR A GLEANING OF NUTS IN AN ADJOINING HEDGE-ROW,
AND THEY WERE GONE BY DEGREES QUITE OUT OF SIGHT AND SOUND,
MARY WAS HAPPY NO LONGER; SHE QUARRELLED WITH HER OWN SEAT,
WAS SURE LOUISA HAD GOT A MUCH BETTER SOMEWHERE, AND NOTHING COULD
PREVENT HER FROM GOING TO LOOK FOR A BETTER ALSO.  SHE TURNED THROUGH
THE SAME GATE, BUT COULD NOT SEE THEM.  ANNE FOUND A NICE SEAT
FOR HER, ON A DRY SUNNY BANK, UNDER THE HEDGE-ROW, IN WHICH
SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF THEIR STILL BEING, IN SOME SPOT OR OTHER.
MARY SAT DOWN FOR A MOMENT, BUT IT WOULD NOT DO; SHE WAS SURE LOUISA
HAD FOUND A BETTER SEAT SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND SHE WOULD GO ON
TILL SHE OVERTOOK HER.

ANNE, REALLY TIRED HERSELF, WAS GLAD TO SIT DOWN; AND SHE VERY SOON HEARD
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AND LOUISA IN THE HEDGE-ROW, BEHIND HER, AS IF
MAKING THEIR WAY BACK ALONG THE ROUGH, WILD SORT OF CHANNEL, DOWN THE
CENTRE.  THEY WERE SPEAKING AS THEY DREW NEAR.  LOUISA'S VOICE WAS
THE FIRST DISTINGUISHED.  SHE SEEMED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME
EAGER SPEECH.  WHAT ANNE FIRST HEARD WAS--

"AND SO, I MADE HER GO.  I COULD NOT BEAR THAT SHE SHOULD BE FRIGHTENED
FROM THE VISIT BY SUCH NONSENSE.  WHAT! WOULD I BE TURNED BACK FROM
DOING A THING THAT I HAD DETERMINED TO DO, AND THAT I KNEW TO BE RIGHT,
BY THE AIRS AND INTERFERENCE OF SUCH A PERSON, OR OF ANY PERSON I MAY SAY?
NO, I HAVE NO IDEA OF BEING SO EASILY PERSUADED.  WHEN I HAVE
MADE UP MY MIND, I HAVE MADE IT; AND HENRIETTA SEEMED ENTIRELY
TO HAVE MADE UP HERS TO CALL AT WINTHROP TO-DAY; AND YET, SHE WAS AS NEAR
GIVING IT UP, OUT OF NONSENSICAL COMPLAISANCE!"

"SHE WOULD HAVE TURNED BACK THEN, BUT FOR YOU?"

"SHE WOULD INDEED.  I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO SAY IT."

"HAPPY FOR HER, TO HAVE SUCH A MIND AS YOURS AT HAND!  AFTER THE HINTS
YOU GAVE JUST NOW, WHICH DID BUT CONFIRM MY OWN OBSERVATIONS,
THE LAST TIME I WAS IN COMPANY WITH HIM,  I NEED NOT AFFECT
TO HAVE NO COMPREHENSION OF WHAT IS GOING ON.  I SEE THAT MORE THAN
A MERE DUTIFUL MORNING VISIT TO YOUR AUNT WAS IN QUESTION;
AND WOE BETIDE HIM, AND HER TOO, WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE,
WHEN THEY ARE PLACED IN CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRING FORTITUDE AND
STRENGTH OF MIND, IF SHE HAVE NOT RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO RESIST
IDLE INTERFERENCE IN SUCH A TRIFLE AS THIS.  YOUR SISTER IS
AN AMIABLE CREATURE; BUT YOURS IS THE CHARACTER OF DECISION AND FIRMNESS,
I SEE.  IF YOU VALUE HER CONDUCT OR HAPPINESS, INFUSE AS MUCH
OF YOUR OWN SPIRIT INTO HER AS YOU CAN.  BUT THIS, NO DOUBT,
YOU HAVE BEEN ALWAYS DOING.  IT IS THE WORST EVIL OF TOO YIELDING
AND INDECISIVE A CHARACTER, THAT NO INFLUENCE OVER IT CAN BE DEPENDED ON.
YOU ARE NEVER SURE OF A GOOD IMPRESSION BEING DURABLE; EVERYBODY
MAY SWAY IT.  LET THOSE WHO WOULD BE HAPPY BE FIRM.  HERE IS A NUT,"
SAID HE, CATCHING ONE DOWN FROM AN UPPER BOUGH.  "TO EXEMPLIFY:
A BEAUTIFUL GLOSSY NUT, WHICH, BLESSED WITH ORIGINAL STRENGTH,
HAS OUTLIVED ALL THE STORMS OF AUTUMN.  NOT A PUNCTURE, NOT
A WEAK SPOT ANYWHERE.  THIS NUT," HE CONTINUED, WITH PLAYFUL SOLEMNITY,
"WHILE SO MANY OF HIS BRETHREN HAVE FALLEN AND BEEN TRODDEN UNDER FOOT,
IS STILL IN POSSESSION OF ALL THE HAPPINESS THAT A HAZEL NUT CAN BE
SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF."  THEN RETURNING TO HIS FORMER EARNEST TONE--
"MY FIRST WISH FOR ALL WHOM I AM INTERESTED IN, IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE FIRM.
IF LOUISA MUSGROVE WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY IN HER NOVEMBER OF LIFE,
SHE WILL CHERISH ALL HER PRESENT POWERS OF MIND."

HE HAD DONE, AND WAS UNANSWERED.  IT WOULD HAVE SURPRISED ANNE IF LOUISA
COULD HAVE READILY ANSWERED SUCH A SPEECH:  WORDS OF SUCH INTEREST,
SPOKEN WITH SUCH SERIOUS WARMTH!  SHE COULD IMAGINE WHAT LOUISA WAS FEELING.
FOR HERSELF, SHE FEARED TO MOVE, LEST SHE SHOULD BE SEEN.
WHILE SHE REMAINED, A BUSH OF LOW RAMBLING HOLLY PROTECTED HER,
AND THEY WERE MOVING ON.  BEFORE THEY WERE BEYOND HER HEARING,
HOWEVER, LOUISA SPOKE AGAIN.

"MARY IS GOOD-NATURED ENOUGH IN MANY RESPECTS," SAID SHE;
"BUT SHE DOES SOMETIMES PROVOKE ME EXCESSIVELY, BY HER NONSENSE
AND PRIDE--THE ELLIOT PRIDE.  SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH
OF THE ELLIOT PRIDE.  WE DO SO WISH THAT CHARLES HAD MARRIED ANNE INSTEAD.
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW HE WANTED TO MARRY ANNE?"

AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SAID--

"DO YOU MEAN THAT SHE REFUSED HIM?"

"OH! YES; CERTAINLY."

"WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?"

"I DO NOT EXACTLY KNOW, FOR HENRIETTA AND I WERE AT SCHOOL AT THE TIME;
BUT I BELIEVE ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE HE MARRIED MARY.  I WISH SHE HAD
ACCEPTED HIM.  WE SHOULD ALL HAVE LIKED HER A GREAT DEAL BETTER;
AND PAPA AND MAMMA ALWAYS THINK IT WAS HER GREAT FRIEND
LADY RUSSELL'S DOING, THAT SHE DID NOT.  THEY THINK CHARLES
MIGHT NOT BE LEARNED AND BOOKISH ENOUGH TO PLEASE LADY RUSSELL,
AND THAT THEREFORE, SHE PERSUADED ANNE TO REFUSE HIM."

THE SOUNDS WERE RETREATING, AND ANNE DISTINGUISHED NO MORE.
HER OWN EMOTIONS STILL KEPT HER FIXED.  SHE HAD MUCH TO RECOVER FROM,
BEFORE SHE COULD MOVE.  THE LISTENER'S PROVERBIAL FATE WAS
NOT ABSOLUTELY HERS; SHE HAD HEARD NO EVIL OF HERSELF, BUT SHE HAD HEARD
A GREAT DEAL OF VERY PAINFUL IMPORT.  SHE SAW HOW HER OWN CHARACTER
WAS CONSIDERED BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AND THERE HAD BEEN JUST THAT DEGREE
OF FEELING AND CURIOSITY ABOUT HER IN HIS MANNER WHICH MUST GIVE HER
EXTREME AGITATION.

AS SOON AS SHE COULD, SHE WENT AFTER MARY, AND HAVING FOUND,
AND WALKED BACK WITH HER TO THEIR FORMER STATION, BY THE STILE,
FELT SOME COMFORT IN THEIR WHOLE PARTY BEING IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
COLLECTED, AND ONCE MORE IN MOTION TOGETHER.  HER SPIRITS WANTED
THE SOLITUDE AND SILENCE WHICH ONLY NUMBERS COULD GIVE.

CHARLES AND HENRIETTA RETURNED, BRINGING, AS MAY BE CONJECTURED,
CHARLES HAYTER WITH THEM.  THE MINUTIAE OF THE BUSINESS ANNE
COULD NOT ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND; EVEN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH DID NOT SEEM
ADMITTED TO PERFECT CONFIDENCE HERE; BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN A WITHDRAWING
ON THE GENTLEMAN'S SIDE, AND A RELENTING ON THE LADY'S, AND THAT THEY
WERE NOW VERY GLAD TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN, DID NOT ADMIT A DOUBT.
HENRIETTA LOOKED A LITTLE ASHAMED, BUT VERY WELL PLEASED;--
CHARLES HAYTER EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY:  AND THEY WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER
ALMOST FROM THE FIRST INSTANT OF THEIR ALL SETTING FORWARD FOR UPPERCROSS.

EVERYTHING NOW MARKED OUT LOUISA FOR CAPTAIN WENTWORTH;
NOTHING COULD BE PLAINER; AND WHERE MANY DIVISIONS WERE NECESSARY,
OR EVEN WHERE THEY WERE NOT, THEY WALKED SIDE BY SIDE NEARLY AS MUCH
AS THE OTHER TWO.  IN A LONG STRIP OF MEADOW LAND, WHERE THERE WAS
AMPLE SPACE FOR ALL, THEY WERE THUS DIVIDED, FORMING THREE DISTINCT PARTIES;
AND TO THAT PARTY OF THE THREE WHICH BOASTED LEAST ANIMATION,
AND LEAST COMPLAISANCE, ANNE NECESSARILY BELONGED.  SHE JOINED CHARLES
AND MARY, AND WAS TIRED ENOUGH TO BE VERY GLAD OF CHARLES'S OTHER ARM;
BUT CHARLES, THOUGH IN VERY GOOD HUMOUR WITH HER, WAS OUT OF TEMPER
WITH HIS WIFE.  MARY HAD SHEWN HERSELF DISOBLIGING TO HIM,
AND WAS NOW TO REAP THE CONSEQUENCE, WHICH CONSEQUENCE WAS
HIS DROPPING HER ARM ALMOST EVERY MOMENT TO CUT OFF THE HEADS
OF SOME NETTLES IN THE HEDGE WITH HIS SWITCH; AND WHEN MARY BEGAN
TO COMPLAIN OF IT, AND LAMENT HER BEING ILL-USED, ACCORDING TO CUSTOM,
IN BEING ON THE HEDGE SIDE, WHILE ANNE WAS NEVER INCOMMODED ON THE OTHER,
HE DROPPED THE ARMS OF BOTH TO HUNT AFTER A WEASEL WHICH HE HAD
A MOMENTARY GLANCE OF, AND THEY COULD HARDLY GET HIM ALONG AT ALL.

THIS LONG MEADOW BORDERED A LANE, WHICH THEIR FOOTPATH, AT THE END OF IT
WAS TO CROSS, AND WHEN THE PARTY HAD ALL REACHED THE GATE OF EXIT,
THE CARRIAGE ADVANCING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, WHICH HAD BEEN
SOME TIME HEARD, WAS JUST COMING UP, AND PROVED TO BE ADMIRAL CROFT'S GIG.
HE AND HIS WIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR INTENDED DRIVE, AND WERE RETURNING HOME.
UPON HEARING HOW LONG A WALK THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD ENGAGED IN,
THEY KINDLY OFFERED A SEAT TO ANY LADY WHO MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY TIRED;
IT WOULD SAVE HER A FULL MILE, AND THEY WERE GOING THROUGH UPPERCROSS.
THE INVITATION WAS GENERAL, AND GENERALLY DECLINED.  THE MISS MUSGROVES
WERE NOT AT ALL TIRED, AND MARY WAS EITHER OFFENDED, BY NOT BEING ASKED
BEFORE ANY OF THE OTHERS, OR WHAT LOUISA CALLED THE ELLIOT PRIDE
COULD NOT ENDURE TO MAKE A THIRD IN A ONE HORSE CHAISE.

THE WALKING PARTY HAD CROSSED THE LANE, AND WERE SURMOUNTING AN
OPPOSITE STILE, AND THE ADMIRAL WAS PUTTING HIS HORSE IN MOTION AGAIN,
WHEN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH CLEARED THE HEDGE IN A MOMENT TO SAY SOMETHING
TO HIS SISTER.  THE SOMETHING MIGHT BE GUESSED BY ITS EFFECTS.

"MISS ELLIOT, I AM SURE YOU ARE TIRED," CRIED MRS CROFT.
"DO LET US HAVE THE PLEASURE OF TAKING YOU HOME.  HERE IS EXCELLENT ROOM
FOR THREE, I ASSURE YOU.  IF WE WERE ALL LIKE YOU, I BELIEVE WE MIGHT
SIT FOUR.  YOU MUST, INDEED, YOU MUST."

ANNE WAS STILL IN THE LANE; AND THOUGH INSTINCTIVELY BEGINNING TO DECLINE,
SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PROCEED.  THE ADMIRAL'S KIND URGENCY
CAME IN SUPPORT OF HIS WIFE'S; THEY WOULD NOT BE REFUSED;
THEY COMPRESSED THEMSELVES INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE
TO LEAVE HER A CORNER, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD,
TURNED TO HER, AND QUIETLY OBLIGED HER TO BE ASSISTED INTO THE CARRIAGE.

YES; HE HAD DONE IT.  SHE WAS IN THE CARRIAGE, AND FELT THAT HE HAD
PLACED HER THERE, THAT HIS WILL AND HIS HANDS HAD DONE IT,
THAT SHE OWED IT TO HIS PERCEPTION OF HER FATIGUE, AND HIS RESOLUTION
TO GIVE HER REST.  SHE WAS VERY MUCH AFFECTED BY THE VIEW OF
HIS DISPOSITION TOWARDS HER, WHICH ALL THESE THINGS MADE APPARENT.
THIS LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCE SEEMED THE COMPLETION OF ALL THAT HAD GONE BEFORE.
SHE UNDERSTOOD HIM.  HE COULD NOT FORGIVE HER, BUT HE COULD NOT
BE UNFEELING.  THOUGH CONDEMNING HER FOR THE PAST, AND CONSIDERING IT
WITH HIGH AND UNJUST RESENTMENT, THOUGH PERFECTLY CARELESS OF HER,
AND THOUGH BECOMING ATTACHED TO ANOTHER, STILL HE COULD NOT SEE HER SUFFER,
WITHOUT THE DESIRE OF GIVING HER RELIEF.  IT WAS A REMAINDER
OF FORMER SENTIMENT; IT WAS AN IMPULSE OF PURE, THOUGH UNACKNOWLEDGED
FRIENDSHIP; IT WAS A PROOF OF HIS OWN WARM AND AMIABLE HEART,
WHICH SHE COULD NOT CONTEMPLATE WITHOUT EMOTIONS SO COMPOUNDED
OF PLEASURE AND PAIN, THAT SHE KNEW NOT WHICH PREVAILED.

HER ANSWERS TO THE KINDNESS AND THE REMARKS OF HER COMPANIONS
WERE AT FIRST UNCONSCIOUSLY GIVEN.  THEY HAD TRAVELLED HALF THEIR WAY
ALONG THE ROUGH LANE, BEFORE SHE WAS QUITE AWAKE TO WHAT THEY SAID.
SHE THEN FOUND THEM TALKING OF "FREDERICK."

"HE CERTAINLY MEANS TO HAVE ONE OR OTHER OF THOSE TWO GIRLS, SOPHY,"
SAID THE ADMIRAL; "BUT THERE IS NO SAYING WHICH.  HE HAS BEEN
RUNNING AFTER THEM, TOO, LONG ENOUGH, ONE WOULD THINK, TO MAKE UP HIS MIND.
AY, THIS COMES OF THE PEACE.  IF IT WERE WAR NOW, HE WOULD HAVE
SETTLED IT LONG AGO.  WE SAILORS, MISS ELLIOT, CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE
LONG COURTSHIPS IN TIME OF WAR.  HOW MANY DAYS WAS IT, MY DEAR,
BETWEEN THE FIRST TIME OF MY SEEING YOU AND OUR SITTING DOWN TOGETHER
IN OUR LODGINGS AT NORTH YARMOUTH?"

"WE HAD BETTER NOT TALK ABOUT IT, MY DEAR," REPLIED MRS CROFT, PLEASANTLY;
"FOR IF MISS ELLIOT WERE TO HEAR HOW SOON WE CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING,
SHE WOULD NEVER BE PERSUADED THAT WE COULD BE HAPPY TOGETHER.
I HAD KNOWN YOU BY CHARACTER, HOWEVER, LONG BEFORE."

"WELL, AND I HAD HEARD OF YOU AS A VERY PRETTY GIRL, AND WHAT WERE WE
TO WAIT FOR BESIDES?  I DO NOT LIKE HAVING SUCH THINGS SO LONG IN HAND.
I WISH FREDERICK WOULD SPREAD A LITTLE MORE CANVASS, AND BRING US HOME
ONE OF THESE YOUNG LADIES TO KELLYNCH.  THEN THERE WOULD ALWAYS
BE COMPANY FOR THEM.  AND VERY NICE YOUNG LADIES THEY BOTH ARE;
I HARDLY KNOW ONE FROM THE OTHER."

"VERY GOOD HUMOURED, UNAFFECTED GIRLS, INDEED," SAID MRS CROFT,
IN A TONE OF CALMER PRAISE, SUCH AS MADE ANNE SUSPECT THAT
HER KEENER POWERS MIGHT NOT CONSIDER EITHER OF THEM AS QUITE WORTHY
OF HER BROTHER; "AND A VERY RESPECTABLE FAMILY.  ONE COULD NOT BE
CONNECTED WITH BETTER PEOPLE.  MY DEAR ADMIRAL, THAT POST!
WE SHALL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT POST."

BUT BY COOLLY GIVING THE REINS A BETTER DIRECTION HERSELF THEY HAPPILY
PASSED THE DANGER; AND BY ONCE AFTERWARDS JUDICIOUSLY PUTTING OUT
HER HAND THEY NEITHER FELL INTO A RUT, NOR RAN FOUL OF A DUNG-CART;
AND ANNE, WITH SOME AMUSEMENT AT THEIR STYLE OF DRIVING,
WHICH SHE IMAGINED NO BAD REPRESENTATION OF THE GENERAL GUIDANCE
OF THEIR AFFAIRS, FOUND HERSELF SAFELY DEPOSITED BY THEM AT THE COTTAGE.



CHAPTER 11


THE TIME NOW APPROACHED FOR LADY RUSSELL'S RETURN:  THE DAY WAS EVEN FIXED;
AND ANNE, BEING ENGAGED TO JOIN HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS RESETTLED,
WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO AN EARLY REMOVAL TO KELLYNCH, AND BEGINNING
TO THINK HOW HER OWN COMFORT WAS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY IT.

IT WOULD PLACE HER IN THE SAME VILLAGE WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
WITHIN HALF A MILE OF HIM; THEY WOULD HAVE TO FREQUENT THE SAME CHURCH,
AND THERE MUST BE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE TWO FAMILIES.
THIS WAS AGAINST HER; BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, HE SPENT SO MUCH OF HIS TIME
AT UPPERCROSS, THAT IN REMOVING THENCE SHE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED RATHER
AS LEAVING HIM BEHIND, THAN AS GOING TOWARDS HIM; AND, UPON THE WHOLE,
SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST, ON THIS INTERESTING QUESTION, BE THE GAINER,
ALMOST AS CERTAINLY AS IN HER CHANGE OF DOMESTIC SOCIETY,
IN LEAVING POOR MARY FOR LADY RUSSELL.

SHE WISHED IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR HER TO AVOID EVER SEEING
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AT THE HALL:  THOSE ROOMS HAD WITNESSED
FORMER MEETINGS WHICH WOULD BE BROUGHT TOO PAINFULLY BEFORE HER;
BUT SHE WAS YET MORE ANXIOUS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF LADY RUSSELL AND
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NEVER MEETING ANYWHERE.  THEY DID NOT LIKE EACH OTHER,
AND NO RENEWAL OF ACQUAINTANCE NOW COULD DO ANY GOOD; AND WERE LADY RUSSELL
TO SEE THEM TOGETHER, SHE MIGHT THINK THAT HE HAD TOO MUCH SELF-POSSESSION,
AND SHE TOO LITTLE.

THESE POINTS FORMED HER CHIEF SOLICITUDE IN ANTICIPATING
HER REMOVAL FROM UPPERCROSS, WHERE SHE FELT SHE HAD BEEN STATIONED
QUITE LONG ENOUGH.  HER USEFULNESS TO LITTLE CHARLES WOULD ALWAYS
GIVE SOME SWEETNESS TO THE MEMORY OF HER TWO MONTHS' VISIT THERE,
BUT HE WAS GAINING STRENGTH APACE, AND SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO STAY FOR.

THE CONCLUSION OF HER VISIT, HOWEVER, WAS DIVERSIFIED IN A WAY
WHICH SHE HAD NOT AT ALL IMAGINED.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AFTER BEING UNSEEN
AND UNHEARD OF AT UPPERCROSS FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS, APPEARED AGAIN AMONG THEM
TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF BY A RELATION OF WHAT HAD KEPT HIM AWAY.

A LETTER FROM HIS FRIEND, CAPTAIN HARVILLE, HAVING FOUND HIM OUT AT LAST,
HAD BROUGHT INTELLIGENCE OF CAPTAIN HARVILLE'S BEING SETTLED
WITH HIS FAMILY AT LYME FOR THE WINTER; OF THEIR BEING THEREFORE,
QUITE UNKNOWINGLY, WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF EACH OTHER.  CAPTAIN HARVILLE
HAD NEVER BEEN IN GOOD HEALTH SINCE A SEVERE WOUND WHICH HE RECEIVED
TWO YEARS BEFORE, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S ANXIETY TO SEE HIM
HAD DETERMINED HIM TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO LYME.  HE HAD BEEN THERE
FOR FOUR-AND-TWENTY HOURS.  HIS ACQUITTAL WAS COMPLETE,
HIS FRIENDSHIP WARMLY HONOURED, A LIVELY INTEREST EXCITED FOR HIS FRIEND,
AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE FINE COUNTRY ABOUT LYME SO FEELINGLY ATTENDED TO
BY THE PARTY, THAT AN EARNEST DESIRE TO SEE LYME THEMSELVES,
AND A PROJECT FOR GOING THITHER WAS THE CONSEQUENCE.

THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE ALL WILD TO SEE LYME.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH TALKED
OF GOING THERE AGAIN HIMSELF, IT WAS ONLY SEVENTEEN MILES FROM UPPERCROSS;
THOUGH NOVEMBER, THE WEATHER WAS BY NO MEANS BAD; AND, IN SHORT,
LOUISA, WHO WAS THE MOST EAGER OF THE EAGER, HAVING FORMED
THE RESOLUTION TO GO, AND BESIDES THE PLEASURE OF DOING AS SHE LIKED,
BEING NOW ARMED WITH THE IDEA OF MERIT IN MAINTAINING HER OWN WAY,
BORE DOWN ALL THE WISHES OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER FOR PUTTING IT OFF
TILL SUMMER; AND TO LYME THEY WERE TO GO--CHARLES, MARY, ANNE, HENRIETTA,
LOUISA, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.

THE FIRST HEEDLESS SCHEME HAD BEEN TO GO IN THE MORNING AND RETURN AT NIGHT;
BUT TO THIS MR MUSGROVE, FOR THE SAKE OF HIS HORSES, WOULD NOT CONSENT;
AND WHEN IT CAME TO BE RATIONALLY CONSIDERED, A DAY IN
THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER WOULD NOT LEAVE MUCH TIME FOR SEEING A NEW PLACE,
AFTER DEDUCTING SEVEN HOURS, AS THE NATURE OF THE COUNTRY REQUIRED,
FOR GOING AND RETURNING.  THEY WERE, CONSEQUENTLY, TO STAY THE NIGHT THERE,
AND NOT TO BE EXPECTED BACK TILL THE NEXT DAY'S DINNER.  THIS WAS FELT
TO BE A CONSIDERABLE AMENDMENT; AND THOUGH THEY ALL MET AT THE GREAT HOUSE
AT RATHER AN EARLY BREAKFAST HOUR, AND SET OFF VERY PUNCTUALLY,
IT WAS SO MUCH PAST NOON BEFORE THE TWO CARRIAGES, MR MUSGROVE'S COACH
CONTAINING THE FOUR LADIES, AND CHARLES'S CURRICLE, IN WHICH
HE DROVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WERE DESCENDING THE LONG HILL INTO LYME,
AND ENTERING UPON THE STILL STEEPER STREET OF THE TOWN ITSELF,
THAT IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE MORE THAN TIME
FOR LOOKING ABOUT THEM, BEFORE THE LIGHT AND WARMTH OF THE DAY WERE GONE.

AFTER SECURING ACCOMMODATIONS, AND ORDERING A DINNER AT ONE OF THE INNS,
THE NEXT THING TO BE DONE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY TO WALK DIRECTLY
DOWN TO THE SEA.  THEY WERE COME TOO LATE IN THE YEAR FOR ANY AMUSEMENT
OR VARIETY WHICH LYME, AS A PUBLIC PLACE, MIGHT OFFER.  THE ROOMS
WERE SHUT UP, THE LODGERS ALMOST ALL GONE, SCARCELY ANY FAMILY
BUT OF THE RESIDENTS LEFT; AND, AS THERE IS NOTHING TO ADMIRE
IN THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES, THE REMARKABLE SITUATION OF THE TOWN,
THE PRINCIPAL STREET ALMOST HURRYING INTO THE WATER, THE WALK TO THE COBB,
SKIRTING ROUND THE PLEASANT LITTLE BAY, WHICH, IN THE SEASON,
IS ANIMATED WITH BATHING MACHINES AND COMPANY; THE COBB ITSELF,
ITS OLD WONDERS AND NEW IMPROVEMENTS, WITH THE VERY BEAUTIFUL
LINE OF CLIFFS STRETCHING OUT TO THE EAST OF THE TOWN, ARE WHAT
THE STRANGER'S EYE WILL SEEK; AND A VERY STRANGE STRANGER IT MUST BE,
WHO DOES NOT SEE CHARMS IN THE IMMEDIATE ENVIRONS OF LYME,
TO MAKE HIM WISH TO KNOW IT BETTER.  THE SCENES IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD,
CHARMOUTH, WITH ITS HIGH GROUNDS AND EXTENSIVE SWEEPS OF COUNTRY,
AND STILL MORE, ITS SWEET, RETIRED BAY, BACKED BY DARK CLIFFS,
WHERE FRAGMENTS OF LOW ROCK AMONG THE SANDS, MAKE IT THE HAPPIEST SPOT
FOR WATCHING THE FLOW OF THE TIDE, FOR SITTING IN UNWEARIED CONTEMPLATION;
THE WOODY VARIETIES OF THE CHEERFUL VILLAGE OF UP LYME; AND, ABOVE ALL,
PINNY, WITH ITS GREEN CHASMS BETWEEN ROMANTIC ROCKS, WHERE
THE SCATTERED FOREST TREES AND ORCHARDS OF LUXURIANT GROWTH,
DECLARE THAT MANY A GENERATION MUST HAVE PASSED AWAY SINCE THE FIRST
PARTIAL FALLING OF THE CLIFF PREPARED THE GROUND FOR SUCH A STATE,
WHERE A SCENE SO WONDERFUL AND SO LOVELY IS EXHIBITED, AS MAY
MORE THAN EQUAL ANY OF THE RESEMBLING SCENES OF THE FAR-FAMED
ISLE OF WIGHT:  THESE PLACES MUST BE VISITED, AND VISITED AGAIN,
TO MAKE THE WORTH OF LYME UNDERSTOOD.

THE PARTY FROM UPPERCROSS PASSING DOWN BY THE NOW DESERTED
AND MELANCHOLY LOOKING ROOMS, AND STILL DESCENDING, SOON FOUND THEMSELVES
ON THE SEA-SHORE; AND LINGERING ONLY, AS ALL MUST LINGER AND GAZE
ON A FIRST RETURN TO THE SEA, WHO EVER DESERVED TO LOOK ON IT AT ALL,
PROCEEDED TOWARDS THE COBB, EQUALLY THEIR OBJECT IN ITSELF
AND ON CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S ACCOUNT:  FOR IN A SMALL HOUSE,
NEAR THE FOOT OF AN OLD PIER OF UNKNOWN DATE, WERE THE HARVILLES SETTLED.
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH TURNED IN TO CALL ON HIS FRIEND; THE OTHERS WALKED ON,
AND HE WAS TO JOIN THEM ON THE COBB.

THEY WERE BY NO MEANS TIRED OF WONDERING AND ADMIRING; AND NOT EVEN LOUISA
SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THEY HAD PARTED WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH LONG,
WHEN THEY SAW HIM COMING AFTER THEM, WITH THREE COMPANIONS,
ALL WELL KNOWN ALREADY, BY DESCRIPTION, TO BE CAPTAIN AND MRS HARVILLE,
AND A CAPTAIN BENWICK, WHO WAS STAYING WITH THEM.

CAPTAIN BENWICK HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN FIRST LIEUTENANT OF THE LACONIA;
AND THE ACCOUNT WHICH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD GIVEN OF HIM,
ON HIS RETURN FROM LYME BEFORE, HIS WARM PRAISE OF HIM AS
AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN AND AN OFFICER, WHOM HE HAD ALWAYS VALUED HIGHLY,
WHICH MUST HAVE STAMPED HIM WELL IN THE ESTEEM OF EVERY LISTENER,
HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE HISTORY OF HIS PRIVATE LIFE,
WHICH RENDERED HIM PERFECTLY INTERESTING IN THE EYES OF ALL THE LADIES.
HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO CAPTAIN HARVILLE'S SISTER, AND WAS NOW
MOURNING HER LOSS.  THEY HAD BEEN A YEAR OR TWO WAITING FOR FORTUNE
AND PROMOTION.  FORTUNE CAME, HIS PRIZE-MONEY AS LIEUTENANT BEING GREAT;
PROMOTION, TOO, CAME AT LAST; BUT FANNY HARVILLE DID NOT LIVE TO KNOW IT.
SHE HAD DIED THE PRECEDING SUMMER WHILE HE WAS AT SEA.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
BELIEVED IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MAN TO BE MORE ATTACHED TO WOMAN
THAN POOR BENWICK HAD BEEN TO FANNY HARVILLE, OR TO BE MORE DEEPLY
AFFLICTED UNDER THE DREADFUL CHANGE.  HE CONSIDERED HIS DISPOSITION
AS OF THE SORT WHICH MUST SUFFER HEAVILY, UNITING VERY STRONG FEELINGS
WITH QUIET, SERIOUS, AND RETIRING MANNERS, AND A DECIDED TASTE FOR READING,
AND SEDENTARY PURSUITS.  TO FINISH THE INTEREST OF THE STORY,
THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN HIM AND THE HARVILLES SEEMED, IF POSSIBLE,
AUGMENTED BY THE EVENT WHICH CLOSED ALL THEIR VIEWS OF ALLIANCE,
AND CAPTAIN BENWICK WAS NOW LIVING WITH THEM ENTIRELY.  CAPTAIN HARVILLE
HAD TAKEN HIS PRESENT HOUSE FOR HALF A YEAR; HIS TASTE, AND HIS HEALTH,
AND HIS FORTUNE, ALL DIRECTING HIM TO A RESIDENCE INEXPENSIVE,
AND BY THE SEA; AND THE GRANDEUR OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE RETIREMENT
OF LYME IN THE WINTER, APPEARED EXACTLY ADAPTED TO CAPTAIN BENWICK'S
STATE OF MIND.  THE SYMPATHY AND GOOD-WILL EXCITED TOWARDS CAPTAIN BENWICK
WAS VERY GREAT.

"AND YET," SAID ANNE TO HERSELF, AS THEY NOW MOVED FORWARD
TO MEET THE PARTY, "HE HAS NOT, PERHAPS, A MORE SORROWING HEART
THAN I HAVE.  I CANNOT BELIEVE HIS PROSPECTS SO BLIGHTED FOR EVER.
HE IS YOUNGER THAN I AM; YOUNGER IN FEELING, IF NOT IN FACT;
YOUNGER AS A MAN.  HE WILL RALLY AGAIN, AND BE HAPPY WITH ANOTHER."

THEY ALL MET, AND WERE INTRODUCED.  CAPTAIN HARVILLE WAS A TALL,
DARK MAN, WITH A SENSIBLE, BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE; A LITTLE LAME;
AND FROM STRONG FEATURES AND WANT OF HEALTH, LOOKING MUCH OLDER
THAN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  CAPTAIN BENWICK LOOKED, AND WAS,
THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE, AND, COMPARED WITH EITHER OF THEM,
A LITTLE MAN.  HE HAD A PLEASING FACE AND A MELANCHOLY AIR,
JUST AS HE OUGHT TO HAVE, AND DREW BACK FROM CONVERSATION.

CAPTAIN HARVILLE, THOUGH NOT EQUALLING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IN MANNERS,
WAS A PERFECT GENTLEMAN, UNAFFECTED, WARM, AND OBLIGING.
MRS HARVILLE, A DEGREE LESS POLISHED THAN HER HUSBAND, SEEMED, HOWEVER,
TO HAVE THE SAME GOOD FEELINGS; AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE PLEASANT
THAN THEIR DESIRE OF CONSIDERING THE WHOLE PARTY AS FRIENDS OF THEIR OWN,
BECAUSE THE FRIENDS OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, OR MORE KINDLY HOSPITABLE
THAN THEIR ENTREATIES FOR THEIR ALL PROMISING TO DINE WITH THEM.
THE DINNER, ALREADY ORDERED AT THE INN, WAS AT LAST, THOUGH UNWILLINGLY,
ACCEPTED AS A EXCUSE; BUT THEY SEEMED ALMOST HURT THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT ANY SUCH PARTY TO LYME, WITHOUT CONSIDERING IT
AS A THING OF COURSE THAT THEY SHOULD DINE WITH THEM.

THERE WAS SO MUCH ATTACHMENT TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IN ALL THIS,
AND SUCH A BEWITCHING CHARM IN A DEGREE OF HOSPITALITY SO UNCOMMON,
SO UNLIKE THE USUAL STYLE OF GIVE-AND-TAKE INVITATIONS, AND DINNERS
OF FORMALITY AND DISPLAY, THAT ANNE FELT HER SPIRITS NOT LIKELY TO BE
BENEFITED BY AN INCREASING ACQUAINTANCE AMONG HIS BROTHER-OFFICERS.
"THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL MY FRIENDS," WAS HER THOUGHT;
AND SHE HAD TO STRUGGLE AGAINST A GREAT TENDENCY TO LOWNESS.

ON QUITTING THE COBB, THEY ALL WENT IN-DOORS WITH THEIR NEW FRIENDS,
AND FOUND ROOMS SO SMALL AS NONE BUT THOSE WHO INVITE FROM THE HEART
COULD THINK CAPABLE OF ACCOMMODATING SO MANY.  ANNE HAD
A MOMENT'S ASTONISHMENT ON THE SUBJECT HERSELF; BUT IT WAS SOON LOST
IN THE PLEASANTER FEELINGS WHICH SPRANG FROM THE SIGHT OF ALL
THE INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCES AND NICE ARRANGEMENTS OF CAPTAIN HARVILLE,
TO TURN THE ACTUAL SPACE TO THE BEST ACCOUNT, TO SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCIES
OF LODGING-HOUSE FURNITURE, AND DEFEND THE WINDOWS AND DOORS
AGAINST THE WINTER STORMS TO BE EXPECTED.  THE VARIETIES IN
THE FITTING-UP OF THE ROOMS, WHERE THE COMMON NECESSARIES
PROVIDED BY THE OWNER, IN THE COMMON INDIFFERENT PLIGHT,
WERE CONTRASTED WITH SOME FEW ARTICLES OF A RARE SPECIES OF WOOD,
EXCELLENTLY WORKED UP, AND WITH SOMETHING CURIOUS AND VALUABLE
FROM ALL THE DISTANT COUNTRIES CAPTAIN HARVILLE HAD VISITED,
WERE MORE THAN AMUSING TO ANNE; CONNECTED AS IT ALL WAS WITH HIS PROFESSION,
THE FRUIT OF ITS LABOURS, THE EFFECT OF ITS INFLUENCE ON HIS HABITS,
THE PICTURE OF REPOSE AND DOMESTIC HAPPINESS IT PRESENTED,
MADE IT TO HER A SOMETHING MORE, OR LESS, THAN GRATIFICATION.

CAPTAIN HARVILLE WAS NO READER; BUT HE HAD CONTRIVED
EXCELLENT ACCOMMODATIONS, AND FASHIONED VERY PRETTY SHELVES,
FOR A TOLERABLE COLLECTION OF WELL-BOUND VOLUMES, THE PROPERTY OF
CAPTAIN BENWICK.  HIS LAMENESS PREVENTED HIM FROM TAKING MUCH EXERCISE;
BUT A MIND OF USEFULNESS AND INGENUITY SEEMED TO FURNISH HIM WITH
CONSTANT EMPLOYMENT WITHIN.  HE DREW, HE VARNISHED, HE CARPENTERED,
HE GLUED; HE MADE TOYS FOR THE CHILDREN; HE FASHIONED NEW NETTING-NEEDLES
AND PINS WITH IMPROVEMENTS; AND IF EVERYTHING ELSE WAS DONE,
SAT DOWN TO HIS LARGE FISHING-NET AT ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.

ANNE THOUGHT SHE LEFT GREAT HAPPINESS BEHIND HER WHEN THEY
QUITTED THE HOUSE; AND LOUISA, BY WHOM SHE FOUND HERSELF WALKING,
BURST FORTH INTO RAPTURES OF ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT ON THE CHARACTER
OF THE NAVY; THEIR FRIENDLINESS, THEIR BROTHERLINESS, THEIR OPENNESS,
THEIR UPRIGHTNESS; PROTESTING THAT SHE WAS CONVINCED OF SAILORS HAVING
MORE WORTH AND WARMTH THAN ANY OTHER SET OF MEN IN ENGLAND;
THAT THEY ONLY KNEW HOW TO LIVE, AND THEY ONLY DESERVED TO BE
RESPECTED AND LOVED.

THEY WENT BACK TO DRESS AND DINE; AND SO WELL HAD THE SCHEME
ANSWERED ALREADY, THAT NOTHING WAS FOUND AMISS; THOUGH ITS BEING
"SO ENTIRELY OUT OF SEASON," AND THE "NO THOROUGHFARE OF LYME,"
AND THE "NO EXPECTATION OF COMPANY," HAD BROUGHT MANY APOLOGIES
FROM THE HEADS OF THE INN.

ANNE FOUND HERSELF BY THIS TIME GROWING SO MUCH MORE HARDENED
TO BEING IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S COMPANY THAN SHE HAD AT FIRST IMAGINED
COULD EVER BE, THAT THE SITTING DOWN TO THE SAME TABLE WITH HIM NOW,
AND THE INTERCHANGE OF THE COMMON CIVILITIES ATTENDING ON IT
(THEY NEVER GOT BEYOND), WAS BECOME A MERE NOTHING.

THE NIGHTS WERE TOO DARK FOR THE LADIES TO MEET AGAIN TILL THE MORROW,
BUT CAPTAIN HARVILLE HAD PROMISED THEM A VISIT IN THE EVENING;
AND HE CAME, BRINGING HIS FRIEND ALSO, WHICH WAS MORE THAN
HAD BEEN EXPECTED, IT HAVING BEEN AGREED THAT CAPTAIN BENWICK
HAD ALL THE APPEARANCE OF BEING OPPRESSED BY THE PRESENCE OF
SO MANY STRANGERS.  HE VENTURED AMONG THEM AGAIN, HOWEVER,
THOUGH HIS SPIRITS CERTAINLY DID NOT SEEM FIT FOR THE MIRTH
OF THE PARTY IN GENERAL.

WHILE CAPTAINS WENTWORTH AND HARVILLE LED THE TALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM,
AND BY RECURRING TO FORMER DAYS, SUPPLIED ANECDOTES IN ABUNDANCE
TO OCCUPY AND ENTERTAIN THE OTHERS, IT FELL TO ANNE'S LOT TO BE PLACED
RATHER APART WITH CAPTAIN BENWICK; AND A VERY GOOD IMPULSE
OF HER NATURE OBLIGED HER TO BEGIN AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM.
HE WAS SHY, AND DISPOSED TO ABSTRACTION; BUT THE ENGAGING MILDNESS OF
HER COUNTENANCE, AND GENTLENESS OF HER MANNERS, SOON HAD THEIR EFFECT;
AND ANNE WAS WELL REPAID THE FIRST TROUBLE OF EXERTION.
HE WAS EVIDENTLY A YOUNG MAN OF CONSIDERABLE TASTE IN READING,
THOUGH PRINCIPALLY IN POETRY; AND BESIDES THE PERSUASION OF HAVING
GIVEN HIM AT LEAST AN EVENING'S INDULGENCE IN THE DISCUSSION OF SUBJECTS,
WHICH HIS USUAL COMPANIONS HAD PROBABLY NO CONCERN IN, SHE HAD THE HOPE
OF BEING OF REAL USE TO HIM IN SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE DUTY AND
BENEFIT OF STRUGGLING AGAINST AFFLICTION, WHICH HAD NATURALLY GROWN OUT
OF THEIR CONVERSATION.  FOR, THOUGH SHY, HE DID NOT SEEM RESERVED;
IT HAD RATHER THE APPEARANCE OF FEELINGS GLAD TO BURST THEIR
USUAL RESTRAINTS; AND HAVING TALKED OF POETRY, THE RICHNESS OF
THE PRESENT AGE, AND GONE THROUGH A BRIEF COMPARISON OF OPINION
AS TO THE FIRST-RATE POETS, TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER MARMION
OR THE LADY OF THE LAKE WERE TO BE PREFERRED, AND HOW RANKED THE GIAOUR
AND THE BRIDE OF ABYDOS; AND MOREOVER, HOW THE GIAOUR WAS TO BE PRONOUNCED,
HE SHOWED HIMSELF SO INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE TENDEREST SONGS
OF THE ONE POET, AND ALL THE IMPASSIONED DESCRIPTIONS OF HOPELESS AGONY
OF THE OTHER; HE REPEATED, WITH SUCH TREMULOUS FEELING, THE VARIOUS LINES
WHICH IMAGED A BROKEN HEART, OR A MIND DESTROYED BY WRETCHEDNESS,
AND LOOKED SO ENTIRELY AS IF HE MEANT TO BE UNDERSTOOD,
THAT SHE VENTURED TO HOPE HE DID NOT ALWAYS READ ONLY POETRY,
AND TO SAY, THAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MISFORTUNE OF POETRY TO BE
SELDOM SAFELY ENJOYED BY THOSE WHO ENJOYED IT COMPLETELY;
AND THAT THE STRONG FEELINGS WHICH ALONE COULD ESTIMATE IT TRULY
WERE THE VERY FEELINGS WHICH OUGHT TO TASTE IT BUT SPARINGLY.

HIS LOOKS SHEWING HIM NOT PAINED, BUT PLEASED WITH THIS ALLUSION
TO HIS SITUATION, SHE WAS EMBOLDENED TO GO ON; AND FEELING IN HERSELF
THE RIGHT OF SENIORITY OF MIND, SHE VENTURED TO RECOMMEND
A LARGER ALLOWANCE OF PROSE IN HIS DAILY STUDY; AND ON BEING REQUESTED
TO PARTICULARIZE, MENTIONED SUCH WORKS OF OUR BEST MORALISTS,
SUCH COLLECTIONS OF THE FINEST LETTERS, SUCH MEMOIRS OF CHARACTERS
OF WORTH AND SUFFERING, AS OCCURRED TO HER AT THE MOMENT
AS CALCULATED TO ROUSE AND FORTIFY THE MIND BY THE HIGHEST PRECEPTS,
AND THE STRONGEST EXAMPLES OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS ENDURANCES.

CAPTAIN BENWICK LISTENED ATTENTIVELY, AND SEEMED GRATEFUL FOR
THE INTEREST IMPLIED; AND THOUGH WITH A SHAKE OF THE HEAD,
AND SIGHS WHICH DECLARED HIS LITTLE FAITH IN THE EFFICACY OF ANY BOOKS
ON GRIEF LIKE HIS, NOTED DOWN THE NAMES OF THOSE SHE RECOMMENDED,
AND PROMISED TO PROCURE AND READ THEM.

WHEN THE EVENING WAS OVER, ANNE COULD NOT BUT BE AMUSED AT THE IDEA
OF HER COMING TO LYME TO PREACH PATIENCE AND RESIGNATION TO A YOUNG MAN
WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE; NOR COULD SHE HELP FEARING,
ON MORE SERIOUS REFLECTION, THAT, LIKE MANY OTHER GREAT MORALISTS
AND PREACHERS, SHE HAD BEEN ELOQUENT ON A POINT IN WHICH HER OWN CONDUCT
WOULD ILL BEAR EXAMINATION.



CHAPTER 12


ANNE AND HENRIETTA, FINDING THEMSELVES THE EARLIEST OF THE PARTY
THE NEXT MORNING, AGREED TO STROLL DOWN TO THE SEA BEFORE BREAKFAST.
THEY WENT TO THE SANDS, TO WATCH THE FLOWING OF THE TIDE,
WHICH A FINE SOUTH-EASTERLY BREEZE WAS BRINGING IN WITH ALL THE GRANDEUR
WHICH SO FLAT A SHORE ADMITTED.  THEY PRAISED THE MORNING;
GLORIED IN THE SEA; SYMPATHIZED IN THE DELIGHT OF THE FRESH-FEELING
BREEZE--AND WERE SILENT; TILL HENRIETTA SUDDENLY BEGAN AGAIN WITH--

"OH! YES,--I AM QUITE CONVINCED THAT, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS,
THE SEA-AIR ALWAYS DOES GOOD.  THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF ITS HAVING BEEN
OF THE GREATEST SERVICE TO DR SHIRLEY, AFTER HIS ILLNESS,
LAST SPRING TWELVE-MONTH.  HE DECLARES HIMSELF, THAT COMING TO LYME
FOR A MONTH, DID HIM MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE MEDICINE HE TOOK;
AND, THAT BEING BY THE SEA, ALWAYS MAKES HIM FEEL YOUNG AGAIN.
NOW, I CANNOT HELP THINKING IT A PITY THAT HE DOES NOT LIVE
ENTIRELY BY THE SEA.  I DO THINK HE HAD BETTER LEAVE UPPERCROSS ENTIRELY,
AND FIX AT LYME.  DO NOT YOU, ANNE?  DO NOT YOU AGREE WITH ME,
THAT IT IS THE BEST THING HE COULD DO, BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND MRS SHIRLEY?
SHE HAS COUSINS HERE, YOU KNOW, AND MANY ACQUAINTANCE, WHICH WOULD
MAKE IT CHEERFUL FOR HER, AND I AM SURE SHE WOULD BE GLAD
TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE SHE COULD HAVE MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AT HAND,
IN CASE OF HIS HAVING ANOTHER SEIZURE.  INDEED I THINK IT QUITE MELANCHOLY
TO HAVE SUCH EXCELLENT PEOPLE AS DR AND MRS SHIRLEY, WHO HAVE BEEN
DOING GOOD ALL THEIR LIVES, WEARING OUT THEIR LAST DAYS IN A PLACE
LIKE UPPERCROSS, WHERE, EXCEPTING OUR FAMILY, THEY SEEM SHUT OUT
FROM ALL THE WORLD.  I WISH HIS FRIENDS WOULD PROPOSE IT TO HIM.
I REALLY THINK THEY OUGHT.  AND, AS TO PROCURING A DISPENSATION,
THERE COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY AT HIS TIME OF LIFE, AND WITH HIS CHARACTER.
MY ONLY DOUBT IS, WHETHER ANYTHING COULD PERSUADE HIM TO LEAVE HIS PARISH.
HE IS SO VERY STRICT AND SCRUPULOUS IN HIS NOTIONS; OVER-SCRUPULOUS
I MUST SAY.  DO NOT YOU THINK, ANNE, IT IS BEING OVER-SCRUPULOUS?
DO NOT YOU THINK IT IS QUITE A MISTAKEN POINT OF CONSCIENCE,
WHEN A CLERGYMAN SACRIFICES HIS HEALTH FOR THE SAKE OF DUTIES,
WHICH MAY BE JUST AS WELL PERFORMED BY ANOTHER PERSON?  AND AT LYME TOO,
ONLY SEVENTEEN MILES OFF, HE WOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO HEAR,
IF PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WAS ANYTHING TO COMPLAIN OF."

ANNE SMILED MORE THAN ONCE TO HERSELF DURING THIS SPEECH,
AND ENTERED INTO THE SUBJECT, AS READY TO DO GOOD BY ENTERING INTO
THE FEELINGS OF A YOUNG LADY AS OF A YOUNG MAN, THOUGH HERE IT WAS GOOD
OF A LOWER STANDARD, FOR WHAT COULD BE OFFERED BUT GENERAL ACQUIESCENCE?
SHE SAID ALL THAT WAS REASONABLE AND PROPER ON THE BUSINESS;
FELT THE CLAIMS OF DR SHIRLEY TO REPOSE AS SHE OUGHT; SAW HOW VERY
DESIRABLE IT WAS THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SOME ACTIVE, RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN,
AS A RESIDENT CURATE, AND WAS EVEN COURTEOUS ENOUGH TO HINT AT
THE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH RESIDENT CURATE'S BEING MARRIED.

"I WISH," SAID HENRIETTA, VERY WELL PLEASED WITH HER COMPANION,
"I WISH LADY RUSSELL LIVED AT UPPERCROSS, AND WERE INTIMATE
WITH DR SHIRLEY.  I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD OF LADY RUSSELL AS A WOMAN OF
THE GREATEST INFLUENCE WITH EVERYBODY!  I ALWAYS LOOK UPON HER AS ABLE
TO PERSUADE A PERSON TO ANYTHING!  I AM AFRAID OF HER, AS I HAVE
TOLD YOU BEFORE, QUITE AFRAID OF HER, BECAUSE SHE IS SO VERY CLEVER;
BUT I RESPECT HER AMAZINGLY, AND WISH WE HAD SUCH A NEIGHBOUR
AT UPPERCROSS."

ANNE WAS AMUSED BY HENRIETTA'S MANNER OF BEING GRATEFUL,
AND AMUSED ALSO THAT THE COURSE OF EVENTS AND THE NEW INTERESTS
OF HENRIETTA'S VIEWS SHOULD HAVE PLACED HER FRIEND AT ALL IN FAVOUR
WITH ANY OF THE MUSGROVE FAMILY; SHE HAD ONLY TIME, HOWEVER,
FOR A GENERAL ANSWER, AND A WISH THAT SUCH ANOTHER WOMAN
WERE AT UPPERCROSS, BEFORE ALL SUBJECTS SUDDENLY CEASED,
ON SEEING LOUISA AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH COMING TOWARDS THEM.
THEY CAME ALSO FOR A STROLL TILL BREAKFAST WAS LIKELY TO BE READY;
BUT LOUISA RECOLLECTING, IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING
TO PROCURE AT A SHOP, INVITED THEM ALL TO GO BACK WITH HER INTO THE TOWN.
THEY WERE ALL AT HER DISPOSAL.

WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STEPS, LEADING UPWARDS FROM THE BEACH, A GENTLEMAN,
AT THE SAME MOMENT PREPARING TO COME DOWN, POLITELY DREW BACK,
AND STOPPED TO GIVE THEM WAY.  THEY ASCENDED AND PASSED HIM;
AND AS THEY PASSED, ANNE'S FACE CAUGHT HIS EYE, AND HE LOOKED AT HER
WITH A DEGREE OF EARNEST ADMIRATION, WHICH SHE COULD NOT BE INSENSIBLE OF.
SHE WAS LOOKING REMARKABLY WELL; HER VERY REGULAR, VERY PRETTY FEATURES,
HAVING THE BLOOM AND FRESHNESS OF YOUTH RESTORED BY THE FINE WIND
WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWING ON HER COMPLEXION, AND BY THE ANIMATION OF EYE
WHICH IT HAD ALSO PRODUCED.  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE GENTLEMAN,
(COMPLETELY A GENTLEMAN IN MANNER) ADMIRED HER EXCEEDINGLY.
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH LOOKED ROUND AT HER INSTANTLY IN A WAY WHICH
SHEWED HIS NOTICING OF IT.  HE GAVE HER A MOMENTARY GLANCE,
A GLANCE OF BRIGHTNESS, WHICH SEEMED TO SAY, "THAT MAN IS STRUCK WITH YOU,
AND EVEN I, AT THIS MOMENT, SEE SOMETHING LIKE ANNE ELLIOT AGAIN."

AFTER ATTENDING LOUISA THROUGH HER BUSINESS, AND LOITERING ABOUT
A LITTLE LONGER, THEY RETURNED TO THE INN; AND ANNE, IN PASSING AFTERWARDS
QUICKLY FROM HER OWN CHAMBER TO THEIR DINING-ROOM, HAD NEARLY RUN AGAINST
THE VERY SAME GENTLEMAN, AS HE CAME OUT OF AN ADJOINING APARTMENT.
SHE HAD BEFORE CONJECTURED HIM TO BE A STRANGER LIKE THEMSELVES,
AND DETERMINED THAT A WELL-LOOKING GROOM, WHO WAS STROLLING ABOUT
NEAR THE TWO INNS AS THEY CAME BACK, SHOULD BE HIS SERVANT.
BOTH MASTER AND MAN BEING IN MOURNING ASSISTED THE IDEA.
IT WAS NOW PROVED THAT HE BELONGED TO THE SAME INN AS THEMSELVES;
AND THIS SECOND MEETING, SHORT AS IT WAS, ALSO PROVED AGAIN
BY THE GENTLEMAN'S LOOKS, THAT HE THOUGHT HERS VERY LOVELY,
AND BY THE READINESS AND PROPRIETY OF HIS APOLOGIES, THAT HE WAS
A MAN OF EXCEEDINGLY GOOD MANNERS.  HE SEEMED ABOUT THIRTY,
AND THOUGH NOT HANDSOME, HAD AN AGREEABLE PERSON.  ANNE FELT THAT
SHE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO HE WAS.

THEY HAD NEARLY DONE BREAKFAST, WHEN THE SOUND OF A CARRIAGE,
(ALMOST THE FIRST THEY HAD HEARD SINCE ENTERING LYME) DREW HALF THE PARTY
TO THE WINDOW.  IT WAS A GENTLEMAN'S CARRIAGE, A CURRICLE,
BUT ONLY COMING ROUND FROM THE STABLE-YARD TO THE FRONT DOOR;
SOMEBODY MUST BE GOING AWAY.  IT WAS DRIVEN BY A SERVANT IN MOURNING.

THE WORD CURRICLE MADE CHARLES MUSGROVE JUMP UP THAT HE MIGHT
COMPARE IT WITH HIS OWN; THE SERVANT IN MOURNING ROUSED ANNE'S CURIOSITY,
AND THE WHOLE SIX WERE COLLECTED TO LOOK, BY THE TIME THE OWNER
OF THE CURRICLE WAS TO BE SEEN ISSUING FROM THE DOOR AMIDST THE BOWS
AND CIVILITIES OF THE HOUSEHOLD, AND TAKING HIS SEAT, TO DRIVE OFF.

"AH!" CRIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, INSTANTLY, AND WITH HALF A GLANCE AT ANNE,
"IT IS THE VERY MAN WE PASSED."

THE MISS MUSGROVES AGREED TO IT; AND HAVING ALL KINDLY WATCHED HIM
AS FAR UP THE HILL AS THEY COULD, THEY RETURNED TO THE BREAKFAST TABLE.
THE WAITER CAME INTO THE ROOM SOON AFTERWARDS.

"PRAY," SAID CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IMMEDIATELY, "CAN YOU TELL US THE NAME
OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS JUST GONE AWAY?"

"YES, SIR, A MR ELLIOT, A GENTLEMAN OF LARGE FORTUNE, CAME IN LAST NIGHT
FROM SIDMOUTH.  DARE SAY YOU HEARD THE CARRIAGE, SIR, WHILE YOU WERE
AT DINNER; AND GOING ON NOW FOR CREWKHERNE, IN HIS WAY TO BATH
AND LONDON."

"ELLIOT!"  MANY HAD LOOKED ON EACH OTHER, AND MANY HAD REPEATED THE NAME,
BEFORE ALL THIS HAD BEEN GOT THROUGH, EVEN BY THE SMART RAPIDITY
OF A WAITER.

"BLESS ME!" CRIED MARY; "IT MUST BE OUR COUSIN; IT MUST BE OUR MR ELLIOT,
IT MUST, INDEED!  CHARLES, ANNE, MUST NOT IT?  IN MOURNING, YOU SEE,
JUST AS OUR MR ELLIOT MUST BE.  HOW VERY EXTRAORDINARY!
IN THE VERY SAME INN WITH US!  ANNE, MUST NOT IT BE OUR MR ELLIOT?
MY FATHER'S NEXT HEIR?  PRAY SIR," TURNING TO THE WAITER,
"DID NOT YOU HEAR, DID NOT HIS SERVANT SAY WHETHER HE BELONGED
TO THE KELLYNCH FAMILY?"

"NO, MA'AM, HE DID NOT MENTION NO PARTICULAR FAMILY; BUT HE SAID
HIS MASTER WAS A VERY RICH GENTLEMAN, AND WOULD BE A BARONIGHT SOME DAY."

"THERE! YOU SEE!" CRIED MARY IN AN ECSTASY, "JUST AS I SAID!
HEIR TO SIR WALTER ELLIOT!  I WAS SURE THAT WOULD COME OUT,
IF IT WAS SO.  DEPEND UPON IT, THAT IS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HIS SERVANTS
TAKE CARE TO PUBLISH, WHEREVER HE GOES.  BUT, ANNE, ONLY CONCEIVE
HOW EXTRAORDINARY!  I WISH I HAD LOOKED AT HIM MORE.  I WISH WE HAD
BEEN AWARE IN TIME, WHO IT WAS, THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO US.
WHAT A PITY THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO EACH OTHER!
DO YOU THINK HE HAD THE ELLIOT COUNTENANCE?  I HARDLY LOOKED AT HIM,
I WAS LOOKING AT THE HORSES; BUT I THINK HE HAD SOMETHING
OF THE ELLIOT COUNTENANCE, I WONDER THE ARMS DID NOT STRIKE ME!
OH! THE GREAT-COAT WAS HANGING OVER THE PANEL, AND HID THE ARMS,
SO IT DID; OTHERWISE, I AM SURE, I SHOULD HAVE OBSERVED THEM,
AND THE LIVERY TOO; IF THE SERVANT HAD NOT BEEN IN MOURNING,
ONE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HIM BY THE LIVERY."

"PUTTING ALL THESE VERY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES TOGETHER,"
SAID CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, "WE MUST CONSIDER IT TO BE THE ARRANGEMENT
OF PROVIDENCE, THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED TO YOUR COUSIN."

WHEN SHE COULD COMMAND MARY'S ATTENTION, ANNE QUIETLY TRIED
TO CONVINCE HER THAT THEIR FATHER AND MR ELLIOT HAD NOT, FOR MANY YEARS,
BEEN ON SUCH TERMS AS TO MAKE THE POWER OF ATTEMPTING AN INTRODUCTION
AT ALL DESIRABLE.

AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, IT WAS A SECRET GRATIFICATION TO HERSELF
TO HAVE SEEN HER COUSIN, AND TO KNOW THAT THE FUTURE OWNER OF KELLYNCH
WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A GENTLEMAN, AND HAD AN AIR OF GOOD SENSE.
SHE WOULD NOT, UPON ANY ACCOUNT, MENTION HER HAVING MET WITH HIM
THE SECOND TIME; LUCKILY MARY DID NOT MUCH ATTEND TO THEIR HAVING
PASSED CLOSE BY HIM IN THEIR EARLIER WALK, BUT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT
QUITE ILL-USED BY ANNE'S HAVING ACTUALLY RUN AGAINST HIM IN THE PASSAGE,
AND RECEIVED HIS VERY POLITE EXCUSES, WHILE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN
NEAR HIM AT ALL; NO, THAT COUSINLY LITTLE INTERVIEW MUST REMAIN
A PERFECT SECRET.

"OF COURSE," SAID MARY, "YOU WILL MENTION OUR SEEING MR ELLIOT,
THE NEXT TIME YOU WRITE TO BATH.  I THINK MY FATHER CERTAINLY
OUGHT TO HEAR OF IT; DO MENTION ALL ABOUT HIM."

ANNE AVOIDED A DIRECT REPLY, BUT IT WAS JUST THE CIRCUMSTANCE
WHICH SHE CONSIDERED AS NOT MERELY UNNECESSARY TO BE COMMUNICATED,
BUT AS WHAT OUGHT TO BE SUPPRESSED.  THE OFFENCE WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN
HER FATHER, MANY YEARS BACK, SHE KNEW; ELIZABETH'S PARTICULAR SHARE IN IT
SHE SUSPECTED; AND THAT MR ELLIOT'S IDEA ALWAYS PRODUCED IRRITATION IN BOTH
WAS BEYOND A DOUBT.  MARY NEVER WROTE TO BATH HERSELF; ALL THE TOIL
OF KEEPING UP A SLOW AND UNSATISFACTORY CORRESPONDENCE WITH ELIZABETH
FELL ON ANNE.

BREAKFAST HAD NOT BEEN LONG OVER, WHEN THEY WERE JOINED BY CAPTAIN
AND MRS HARVILLE AND CAPTAIN BENWICK; WITH WHOM THEY HAD APPOINTED
TO TAKE THEIR LAST WALK ABOUT LYME.  THEY OUGHT TO BE SETTING OFF
FOR UPPERCROSS BY ONE, AND IN THE MEAN WHILE WERE TO BE ALL TOGETHER,
AND OUT OF DOORS AS LONG AS THEY COULD.

ANNE FOUND CAPTAIN BENWICK GETTING NEAR HER, AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALL
FAIRLY IN THE STREET.  THEIR CONVERSATION THE PRECEDING EVENING
DID NOT DISINCLINE HIM TO SEEK HER AGAIN; AND THEY WALKED TOGETHER
SOME TIME, TALKING AS BEFORE OF MR SCOTT AND LORD BYRON,
AND STILL AS UNABLE AS BEFORE, AND AS UNABLE AS ANY OTHER TWO READERS,
TO THINK EXACTLY ALIKE OF THE MERITS OF EITHER, TILL SOMETHING
OCCASIONED AN ALMOST GENERAL CHANGE AMONGST THEIR PARTY, AND INSTEAD OF
CAPTAIN BENWICK, SHE HAD CAPTAIN HARVILLE BY HER SIDE.

"MISS ELLIOT," SAID HE, SPEAKING RATHER LOW, "YOU HAVE DONE A GOOD DEED
IN MAKING THAT POOR FELLOW TALK SO MUCH.  I WISH HE COULD HAVE
SUCH COMPANY OFTENER.  IT IS BAD FOR HIM, I KNOW, TO BE SHUT UP AS HE IS;
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO?  WE CANNOT PART."

"NO," SAID ANNE, "THAT I CAN EASILY BELIEVE TO BE IMPOSSIBLE;
BUT IN TIME, PERHAPS--WE KNOW WHAT TIME DOES IN EVERY CASE OF AFFLICTION,
AND YOU MUST REMEMBER, CAPTAIN HARVILLE, THAT YOUR FRIEND
MAY YET BE CALLED A YOUNG MOURNER--ONLY LAST SUMMER, I UNDERSTAND."

"AY, TRUE ENOUGH," (WITH A DEEP SIGH) "ONLY JUNE."

"AND NOT KNOWN TO HIM, PERHAPS, SO SOON."

"NOT TILL THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST, WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM THE CAPE,
JUST MADE INTO THE GRAPPLER.  I WAS AT PLYMOUTH DREADING TO HEAR OF HIM;
HE SENT IN LETTERS, BUT THE GRAPPLER WAS UNDER ORDERS FOR PORTSMOUTH.
THERE THE NEWS MUST FOLLOW HIM, BUT WHO WAS TO TELL IT? NOT I.
I WOULD AS SOON HAVE BEEN RUN UP TO THE YARD-ARM.  NOBODY COULD DO IT,
BUT THAT GOOD FELLOW" (POINTING TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.)  "THE LACONIA
HAD COME INTO PLYMOUTH THE WEEK BEFORE; NO DANGER OF HER
BEING SENT TO SEA AGAIN.  HE STOOD HIS CHANCE FOR THE REST;
WROTE UP FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE, BUT WITHOUT WAITING THE RETURN,
TRAVELLED NIGHT AND DAY TILL HE GOT TO PORTSMOUTH, ROWED OFF
TO THE GRAPPLER THAT INSTANT, AND NEVER LEFT THE POOR FELLOW FOR A WEEK.
THAT'S WHAT HE DID, AND NOBODY ELSE COULD HAVE SAVED POOR JAMES.
YOU MAY THINK, MISS ELLIOT, WHETHER HE IS DEAR TO US!"

ANNE DID THINK ON THE QUESTION WITH PERFECT DECISION, AND SAID AS MUCH
IN REPLY AS HER OWN FEELING COULD ACCOMPLISH, OR AS HIS SEEMED
ABLE TO BEAR, FOR HE WAS TOO MUCH AFFECTED TO RENEW THE SUBJECT,
AND WHEN HE SPOKE AGAIN, IT WAS OF SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

MRS HARVILLE'S GIVING IT AS HER OPINION THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE
QUITE WALKING ENOUGH BY THE TIME HE REACHED HOME, DETERMINED THE DIRECTION
OF ALL THE PARTY IN WHAT WAS TO BE THEIR LAST WALK; THEY WOULD
ACCOMPANY THEM TO THEIR DOOR, AND THEN RETURN AND SET OFF THEMSELVES.
BY ALL THEIR CALCULATIONS THERE WAS JUST TIME FOR THIS; BUT AS THEY DREW
NEAR THE COBB, THERE WAS SUCH A GENERAL WISH TO WALK ALONG IT ONCE MORE,
ALL WERE SO INCLINED, AND LOUISA SOON GREW SO DETERMINED,
THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, IT WAS FOUND,
WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL; SO WITH ALL THE KIND LEAVE-TAKING,
AND ALL THE KIND INTERCHANGE OF INVITATIONS AND PROMISES WHICH
MAY BE IMAGINED, THEY PARTED FROM CAPTAIN AND MRS HARVILLE
AT THEIR OWN DOOR, AND STILL ACCOMPANIED BY CAPTAIN BENWICK,
WHO SEEMED TO CLING TO THEM TO THE LAST, PROCEEDED TO MAKE
THE PROPER ADIEUS TO THE COBB.

ANNE FOUND CAPTAIN BENWICK AGAIN DRAWING NEAR HER.  LORD BYRON'S
"DARK BLUE SEAS" COULD NOT FAIL OF BEING BROUGHT FORWARD BY
THEIR PRESENT VIEW, AND SHE GLADLY GAVE HIM ALL HER ATTENTION AS LONG AS
ATTENTION WAS POSSIBLE.  IT WAS SOON DRAWN, PERFORCE ANOTHER WAY.

THERE WAS TOO MUCH WIND TO MAKE THE HIGH PART OF THE NEW COBB PLEASANT
FOR THE LADIES, AND THEY AGREED TO GET DOWN THE STEPS TO THE LOWER,
AND ALL WERE CONTENTED TO PASS QUIETLY AND CAREFULLY DOWN THE STEEP FLIGHT,
EXCEPTING LOUISA; SHE MUST BE JUMPED DOWN THEM BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.
IN ALL THEIR WALKS, HE HAD HAD TO JUMP HER FROM THE STILES;
THE SENSATION WAS DELIGHTFUL TO HER.  THE HARDNESS OF THE PAVEMENT
FOR HER FEET, MADE HIM LESS WILLING UPON THE PRESENT OCCASION;
HE DID IT, HOWEVER.  SHE WAS SAFELY DOWN, AND INSTANTLY,
TO SHOW HER ENJOYMENT, RAN UP THE STEPS TO BE JUMPED DOWN AGAIN.
HE ADVISED HER AGAINST IT, THOUGHT THE JAR TOO GREAT; BUT NO,
HE REASONED AND TALKED IN VAIN, SHE SMILED AND SAID, "I AM DETERMINED
I WILL:" HE PUT OUT HIS HANDS; SHE WAS TOO PRECIPITATE BY HALF A SECOND,
SHE FELL ON THE PAVEMENT ON THE LOWER COBB, AND WAS TAKEN UP LIFELESS!
THERE WAS NO WOUND, NO BLOOD, NO VISIBLE BRUISE; BUT HER EYES WERE CLOSED,
SHE BREATHED NOT, HER FACE WAS LIKE DEATH.  THE HORROR OF THE MOMENT
TO ALL WHO STOOD AROUND!

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WHO HAD CAUGHT HER UP, KNELT WITH HER IN HIS ARMS,
LOOKING ON HER WITH A FACE AS PALLID AS HER OWN, IN AN AGONY OF SILENCE.
"SHE IS DEAD! SHE IS DEAD!" SCREAMED MARY, CATCHING HOLD OF HER
HUSBAND, AND CONTRIBUTING WITH HIS OWN HORROR TO MAKE HIM IMMOVEABLE;
AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT, HENRIETTA, SINKING UNDER THE CONVICTION, LOST
HER SENSES TOO, AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON THE STEPS, BUT FOR CAPTAIN
BENWICK AND ANNE, WHO CAUGHT AND SUPPORTED HER BETWEEN THEM.

"IS THERE NO ONE TO HELP ME?" WERE THE FIRST WORDS WHICH
BURST FROM CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IN A TONE OF DESPAIR, AND AS IF
ALL HIS OWN STRENGTH WERE GONE.

"GO TO HIM, GO TO HIM," CRIED ANNE, "FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE GO TO HIM.
I CAN SUPPORT HER MYSELF.  LEAVE ME, AND GO TO HIM.  RUB HER HANDS,
RUB HER TEMPLES; HERE ARE SALTS; TAKE THEM, TAKE THEM."

CAPTAIN BENWICK OBEYED, AND CHARLES AT THE SAME MOMENT,
DISENGAGING HIMSELF FROM HIS WIFE, THEY WERE BOTH WITH HIM;
AND LOUISA WAS RAISED UP AND SUPPORTED MORE FIRMLY BETWEEN THEM,
AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT ANNE HAD PROMPTED, BUT IN VAIN;
WHILE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, STAGGERING AGAINST THE WALL FOR HIS SUPPORT,
EXCLAIMED IN THE BITTEREST AGONY--

"OH GOD! HER FATHER AND MOTHER!"

"A SURGEON!" SAID ANNE.

HE CAUGHT THE WORD; IT SEEMED TO ROUSE HIM AT ONCE, AND SAYING ONLY--
"TRUE, TRUE, A SURGEON THIS INSTANT," WAS DARTING AWAY,
WHEN ANNE EAGERLY SUGGESTED--

"CAPTAIN BENWICK, WOULD NOT IT BE BETTER FOR CAPTAIN BENWICK?
HE KNOWS WHERE A SURGEON IS TO BE FOUND."

EVERY ONE CAPABLE OF THINKING FELT THE ADVANTAGE OF THE IDEA,
AND IN A MOMENT (IT WAS ALL DONE IN RAPID MOMENTS) CAPTAIN BENWICK HAD
RESIGNED THE POOR CORPSE-LIKE  FIGURE ENTIRELY TO THE BROTHER'S CARE,
AND WAS OFF FOR THE TOWN WITH THE UTMOST RAPIDITY.

AS TO THE WRETCHED PARTY LEFT BEHIND, IT COULD SCARCELY BE SAID
WHICH OF THE THREE, WHO WERE COMPLETELY RATIONAL, WAS SUFFERING MOST:
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, ANNE, OR CHARLES, WHO, REALLY A VERY AFFECTIONATE
BROTHER, HUNG OVER LOUISA WITH SOBS OF GRIEF, AND COULD ONLY TURN HIS EYES
FROM ONE SISTER, TO SEE THE OTHER IN A STATE AS INSENSIBLE,
OR TO WITNESS THE HYSTERICAL AGITATIONS OF HIS WIFE, CALLING ON HIM
FOR HELP WHICH HE COULD NOT GIVE.

ANNE, ATTENDING WITH ALL THE STRENGTH AND ZEAL, AND THOUGHT,
WHICH INSTINCT SUPPLIED, TO HENRIETTA, STILL TRIED, AT INTERVALS,
TO SUGGEST COMFORT TO THE OTHERS, TRIED TO QUIET MARY, TO ANIMATE CHARLES,
TO ASSUAGE THE FEELINGS OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  BOTH SEEMED TO LOOK TO HER
FOR DIRECTIONS.

"ANNE, ANNE," CRIED CHARLES, "WHAT IS TO BE DONE NEXT?
WHAT, IN HEAVEN'S NAME, IS TO BE DONE NEXT?"

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S EYES WERE ALSO TURNED TOWARDS HER.

"HAD NOT SHE BETTER BE CARRIED TO THE INN?  YES, I AM SURE:
CARRY HER GENTLY TO THE INN."

"YES, YES, TO THE INN," REPEATED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, COMPARATIVELY
COLLECTED, AND EAGER TO BE DOING SOMETHING.  "I WILL CARRY HER MYSELF.
MUSGROVE, TAKE CARE OF THE OTHERS."

BY THIS TIME THE REPORT OF THE ACCIDENT HAD SPREAD AMONG THE WORKMEN
AND BOATMEN ABOUT THE COBB, AND MANY WERE COLLECTED NEAR THEM,
TO BE USEFUL IF WANTED, AT ANY RATE, TO ENJOY THE SIGHT OF
A DEAD YOUNG LADY, NAY, TWO DEAD YOUNG LADIES, FOR IT PROVED TWICE AS FINE
AS THE FIRST REPORT.  TO SOME OF THE BEST-LOOKING OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE
HENRIETTA WAS CONSIGNED, FOR, THOUGH PARTIALLY REVIVED,
SHE WAS QUITE HELPLESS; AND IN THIS MANNER, ANNE WALKING BY HER SIDE,
AND CHARLES ATTENDING TO HIS WIFE, THEY SET FORWARD, TREADING BACK
WITH FEELINGS UNUTTERABLE, THE GROUND, WHICH SO LATELY, SO VERY LATELY,
AND SO LIGHT OF HEART, THEY HAD PASSED ALONG.

THEY WERE NOT OFF THE COBB, BEFORE THE HARVILLES MET THEM.
CAPTAIN BENWICK HAD BEEN SEEN FLYING BY THEIR HOUSE, WITH A COUNTENANCE
WHICH SHOWED SOMETHING TO BE WRONG; AND THEY HAD SET OFF IMMEDIATELY,
INFORMED AND DIRECTED AS THEY PASSED, TOWARDS THE SPOT.
SHOCKED AS CAPTAIN HARVILLE WAS, HE BROUGHT SENSES AND NERVES
THAT COULD BE INSTANTLY USEFUL; AND A LOOK BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE
DECIDED WHAT WAS TO BE DONE.  SHE MUST BE TAKEN TO THEIR HOUSE;
ALL MUST GO TO THEIR HOUSE; AND AWAIT THE SURGEON'S ARRIVAL THERE.
THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO SCRUPLES:  HE WAS OBEYED; THEY WERE ALL
BENEATH HIS ROOF; AND WHILE LOUISA, UNDER MRS HARVILLE'S DIRECTION,
WAS CONVEYED UP STAIRS, AND GIVEN POSSESSION OF HER OWN BED,
ASSISTANCE, CORDIALS, RESTORATIVES WERE SUPPLIED BY HER HUSBAND
TO ALL WHO NEEDED THEM.

LOUISA HAD ONCE OPENED HER EYES, BUT SOON CLOSED THEM AGAIN,
WITHOUT APPARENT CONSCIOUSNESS.  THIS HAD BEEN A PROOF OF LIFE,
HOWEVER, OF SERVICE TO HER SISTER; AND HENRIETTA, THOUGH PERFECTLY
INCAPABLE OF BEING IN THE SAME ROOM WITH LOUISA, WAS KEPT,
BY THE AGITATION OF HOPE AND FEAR, FROM A RETURN OF HER OWN INSENSIBILITY.
MARY, TOO, WAS GROWING CALMER.

THE SURGEON WAS WITH THEM ALMOST BEFORE IT HAD SEEMED POSSIBLE.
THEY WERE SICK WITH HORROR, WHILE HE EXAMINED; BUT HE WAS NOT HOPELESS.
THE HEAD HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE CONTUSION, BUT HE HAD SEEN GREATER INJURIES
RECOVERED FROM:  HE WAS BY NO MEANS HOPELESS; HE SPOKE CHEERFULLY.

THAT HE DID NOT REGARD IT AS A DESPERATE CASE, THAT HE DID NOT SAY
A FEW HOURS MUST END IT, WAS AT FIRST FELT, BEYOND THE HOPE OF MOST;
AND THE ECSTASY OF SUCH A REPRIEVE, THE REJOICING, DEEP AND SILENT,
AFTER A FEW FERVENT EJACULATIONS OF GRATITUDE TO HEAVEN HAD BEEN OFFERED,
MAY BE CONCEIVED.

THE TONE, THE LOOK, WITH WHICH "THANK GOD!" WAS UTTERED
BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, ANNE WAS SURE COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BY HER;
NOR THE SIGHT OF HIM AFTERWARDS, AS HE SAT NEAR A TABLE, LEANING OVER IT
WITH FOLDED ARMS AND FACE CONCEALED, AS IF OVERPOWERED BY
THE VARIOUS FEELINGS OF HIS SOUL, AND TRYING BY PRAYER AND REFLECTION
TO CALM THEM.

LOUISA'S LIMBS HAD ESCAPED.  THERE WAS NO INJURY BUT TO THE HEAD.

IT NOW BECAME NECESSARY FOR THE PARTY TO CONSIDER WHAT WAS BEST TO BE DONE,
AS TO THEIR GENERAL SITUATION.  THEY WERE NOW ABLE TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER
AND CONSULT.  THAT LOUISA MUST REMAIN WHERE SHE WAS, HOWEVER DISTRESSING
TO HER FRIENDS TO BE INVOLVING THE HARVILLES IN SUCH TROUBLE,
DID NOT ADMIT A DOUBT.  HER REMOVAL WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  THE HARVILLES
SILENCED ALL SCRUPLES; AND, AS MUCH AS THEY COULD, ALL GRATITUDE.
THEY HAD LOOKED FORWARD AND ARRANGED EVERYTHING BEFORE THE OTHERS
BEGAN TO REFLECT.  CAPTAIN BENWICK MUST GIVE UP HIS ROOM TO THEM,
AND GET ANOTHER BED ELSEWHERE; AND THE WHOLE WAS SETTLED.
THEY WERE ONLY CONCERNED THAT THE HOUSE COULD ACCOMMODATE NO MORE;
AND YET PERHAPS, BY "PUTTING THE CHILDREN AWAY IN THE MAID'S ROOM,
OR SWINGING A COT SOMEWHERE," THEY COULD HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF NOT
FINDING ROOM FOR TWO OR THREE BESIDES, SUPPOSING THEY MIGHT WISH TO STAY;
THOUGH, WITH REGARD TO ANY ATTENDANCE ON MISS MUSGROVE, THERE NEED NOT BE
THE LEAST UNEASINESS IN LEAVING HER TO MRS HARVILLE'S CARE ENTIRELY.
MRS HARVILLE WAS A VERY EXPERIENCED NURSE, AND HER NURSERY-MAID,
WHO HAD LIVED WITH HER LONG, AND GONE ABOUT WITH HER EVERYWHERE,
WAS JUST SUCH ANOTHER.  BETWEEN THESE TWO, SHE COULD WANT
NO POSSIBLE ATTENDANCE BY DAY OR NIGHT.  AND ALL THIS WAS SAID
WITH A TRUTH AND SINCERITY OF FEELING IRRESISTIBLE.

CHARLES, HENRIETTA, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WERE THE THREE IN CONSULTATION,
AND FOR A LITTLE WHILE IT WAS ONLY AN INTERCHANGE OF PERPLEXITY AND TERROR.
"UPPERCROSS, THE NECESSITY OF SOME ONE'S GOING TO UPPERCROSS;
THE NEWS TO BE CONVEYED; HOW IT COULD BE BROKEN TO MR AND MRS MUSGROVE;
THE LATENESS OF THE MORNING; AN HOUR ALREADY GONE SINCE THEY
OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN OFF; THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING IN TOLERABLE TIME."
AT FIRST, THEY WERE CAPABLE OF NOTHING MORE TO THE PURPOSE
THAN SUCH EXCLAMATIONS; BUT, AFTER A WHILE, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
EXERTING HIMSELF, SAID--

"WE MUST BE DECIDED, AND WITHOUT THE LOSS OF ANOTHER MINUTE.
EVERY MINUTE IS VALUABLE.  SOME ONE MUST RESOLVE ON BEING OFF
FOR UPPERCROSS INSTANTLY.  MUSGROVE, EITHER YOU OR I MUST GO."

CHARLES AGREED, BUT DECLARED HIS RESOLUTION OF NOT GOING AWAY.
HE WOULD BE AS LITTLE INCUMBRANCE AS POSSIBLE TO CAPTAIN AND MRS HARVILLE;
BUT AS TO LEAVING HIS SISTER IN SUCH A STATE, HE NEITHER OUGHT, NOR WOULD.
SO FAR IT WAS DECIDED; AND HENRIETTA AT FIRST DECLARED THE SAME.
SHE, HOWEVER, WAS SOON PERSUADED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY.  THE USEFULNESS
OF HER STAYING!  SHE WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO REMAIN IN LOUISA'S ROOM,
OR TO LOOK AT HER, WITHOUT SUFFERINGS WHICH MADE HER WORSE THAN HELPLESS!
SHE WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE COULD DO NO GOOD,
YET WAS STILL UNWILLING TO BE AWAY, TILL, TOUCHED BY THE THOUGHT
OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER, SHE GAVE IT UP; SHE CONSENTED,
SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO BE AT HOME.

THE PLAN HAD REACHED THIS POINT, WHEN ANNE, COMING QUIETLY
DOWN FROM LOUISA'S ROOM, COULD NOT BUT HEAR WHAT FOLLOWED,
FOR THE PARLOUR DOOR WAS OPEN.

"THEN IT IS SETTLED, MUSGROVE," CRIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
"THAT YOU STAY, AND THAT I TAKE CARE OF YOUR SISTER HOME.
BUT AS TO THE REST, AS TO THE OTHERS, IF ONE STAYS TO ASSIST MRS HARVILLE,
I THINK IT NEED BE ONLY ONE.  MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE WILL, OF COURSE,
WISH TO GET BACK TO HER CHILDREN; BUT IF ANNE WILL STAY, NO ONE SO PROPER,
SO CAPABLE AS ANNE."

SHE PAUSED A MOMENT TO RECOVER FROM THE EMOTION OF HEARING HERSELF
SO SPOKEN OF.  THE OTHER TWO WARMLY AGREED WITH WHAT HE SAID,
AND SHE THEN APPEARED.

"YOU WILL STAY, I AM SURE; YOU WILL STAY AND NURSE HER;" CRIED HE,
TURNING TO HER AND SPEAKING WITH A GLOW, AND YET A GENTLENESS,
WHICH SEEMED ALMOST RESTORING THE PAST.  SHE COLOURED DEEPLY,
AND HE RECOLLECTED HIMSELF AND MOVED AWAY.  SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF
MOST WILLING, READY, HAPPY TO REMAIN.  "IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD BEEN
THINKING OF, AND WISHING TO BE ALLOWED TO DO.  A BED ON THE FLOOR
IN LOUISA'S ROOM WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR HER, IF MRS HARVILLE
WOULD BUT THINK SO."

ONE THING MORE, AND ALL SEEMED ARRANGED.  THOUGH IT WAS RATHER DESIRABLE
THAT MR AND MRS MUSGROVE SHOULD BE PREVIOUSLY ALARMED BY SOME
SHARE OF DELAY; YET THE TIME REQUIRED BY THE UPPERCROSS HORSES
TO TAKE THEM BACK, WOULD BE A DREADFUL EXTENSION OF SUSPENSE;
AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH PROPOSED, AND CHARLES MUSGROVE AGREED,
THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER FOR HIM TO TAKE A CHAISE FROM THE INN,
AND LEAVE MR MUSGROVE'S CARRIAGE AND HORSES TO BE SENT HOME
THE NEXT MORNING EARLY, WHEN THERE WOULD BE THE FARTHER ADVANTAGE
OF SENDING AN ACCOUNT OF LOUISA'S NIGHT.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NOW HURRIED OFF TO GET EVERYTHING READY ON HIS PART,
AND TO BE SOON FOLLOWED BY THE TWO LADIES.  WHEN THE PLAN WAS
MADE KNOWN TO MARY, HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN END OF ALL PEACE IN IT.
SHE WAS SO WRETCHED AND SO VEHEMENT, COMPLAINED SO MUCH OF INJUSTICE
IN BEING EXPECTED TO GO AWAY INSTEAD OF ANNE; ANNE, WHO WAS
NOTHING TO LOUISA, WHILE SHE WAS HER SISTER, AND HAD THE BEST RIGHT
TO STAY IN HENRIETTA'S STEAD!  WHY WAS NOT SHE TO BE AS USEFUL AS ANNE?
AND TO GO HOME WITHOUT CHARLES, TOO, WITHOUT HER HUSBAND!
NO, IT WAS TOO UNKIND.  AND IN SHORT, SHE SAID MORE THAN HER HUSBAND
COULD LONG WITHSTAND, AND AS NONE OF THE OTHERS COULD OPPOSE
WHEN HE GAVE WAY, THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT; THE CHANGE OF MARY FOR ANNE
WAS INEVITABLE.

ANNE HAD NEVER SUBMITTED MORE RELUCTANTLY TO THE JEALOUS
AND ILL-JUDGING CLAIMS OF MARY; BUT SO IT MUST BE, AND THEY SET OFF
FOR THE TOWN, CHARLES TAKING CARE OF HIS SISTER, AND CAPTAIN BENWICK
ATTENDING TO HER.  SHE GAVE A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION, AS THEY HURRIED ALONG,
TO THE LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE SAME SPOTS HAD WITNESSED
EARLIER IN THE MORNING.  THERE SHE HAD LISTENED TO HENRIETTA'S SCHEMES
FOR DR SHIRLEY'S LEAVING UPPERCROSS; FARTHER ON, SHE HAD
FIRST SEEN MR ELLIOT; A MOMENT SEEMED ALL THAT COULD NOW BE GIVEN
TO ANY ONE BUT LOUISA, OR THOSE WHO WERE WRAPT UP IN HER WELFARE.

CAPTAIN BENWICK WAS MOST CONSIDERATELY ATTENTIVE TO HER; AND,
UNITED AS THEY ALL SEEMED BY THE DISTRESS OF THE DAY, SHE FELT
AN INCREASING DEGREE OF GOOD-WILL TOWARDS HIM, AND A PLEASURE EVEN
IN THINKING THAT IT MIGHT, PERHAPS, BE THE OCCASION OF CONTINUING
THEIR ACQUAINTANCE.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS ON THE WATCH FOR THEM, AND A CHAISE AND FOUR IN WAITING,
STATIONED FOR THEIR CONVENIENCE IN THE LOWEST PART OF THE STREET;
BUT HIS EVIDENT SURPRISE AND VEXATION AT THE SUBSTITUTION OF ONE SISTER
FOR THE OTHER, THE CHANGE IN HIS COUNTENANCE, THE ASTONISHMENT,
THE EXPRESSIONS BEGUN AND SUPPRESSED, WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS LISTENED TO,
MADE BUT A MORTIFYING RECEPTION OF ANNE; OR MUST AT LEAST CONVINCE HER
THAT SHE WAS VALUED ONLY AS SHE COULD BE USEFUL TO LOUISA.

SHE ENDEAVOURED TO BE COMPOSED, AND TO BE JUST.  WITHOUT EMULATING
THE FEELINGS OF AN EMMA TOWARDS HER HENRY, SHE WOULD HAVE
ATTENDED ON LOUISA WITH A ZEAL ABOVE THE COMMON CLAIMS OF REGARD,
FOR HIS SAKE; AND SHE HOPED HE WOULD NOT LONG BE SO UNJUST
AS TO SUPPOSE SHE WOULD SHRINK UNNECESSARILY FROM THE OFFICE OF A FRIEND.

IN THE MEAN WHILE SHE WAS IN THE CARRIAGE.  HE HAD HANDED THEM BOTH IN,
AND PLACED HIMSELF BETWEEN THEM; AND IN THIS MANNER, UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES, FULL OF ASTONISHMENT AND EMOTION TO ANNE, SHE QUITTED LYME.
HOW THE LONG STAGE WOULD PASS; HOW IT WAS TO AFFECT THEIR MANNERS;
WHAT WAS TO BE THEIR SORT OF INTERCOURSE, SHE COULD NOT FORESEE.
IT WAS ALL QUITE NATURAL, HOWEVER.  HE WAS DEVOTED TO HENRIETTA;
ALWAYS TURNING TOWARDS HER; AND WHEN HE SPOKE AT ALL, ALWAYS WITH THE VIEW
OF SUPPORTING HER HOPES AND RAISING HER SPIRITS.  IN GENERAL,
HIS VOICE AND MANNER WERE STUDIOUSLY CALM.  TO SPARE HENRIETTA
FROM AGITATION SEEMED THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE.  ONCE ONLY,
WHEN SHE HAD BEEN GRIEVING OVER THE LAST ILL-JUDGED, ILL-FATED
WALK TO THE COBB, BITTERLY LAMENTING THAT IT EVER HAD BEEN THOUGHT OF,
HE BURST FORTH, AS IF WHOLLY OVERCOME--

"DON'T TALK OF IT, DON'T TALK OF IT," HE CRIED.  "OH GOD! THAT I HAD
NOT GIVEN WAY TO HER AT THE FATAL MOMENT!  HAD I DONE AS I OUGHT!
BUT SO EAGER AND SO RESOLUTE! DEAR, SWEET LOUISA!"

ANNE WONDERED WHETHER IT EVER OCCURRED TO HIM NOW, TO QUESTION THE JUSTNESS
OF HIS OWN PREVIOUS OPINION AS TO THE UNIVERSAL FELICITY AND ADVANTAGE
OF FIRMNESS OF CHARACTER; AND WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT STRIKE HIM THAT,
LIKE ALL OTHER QUALITIES OF THE MIND, IT SHOULD HAVE ITS PROPORTIONS
AND LIMITS.  SHE THOUGHT IT COULD SCARCELY ESCAPE HIM TO FEEL
THAT A PERSUADABLE TEMPER MIGHT SOMETIMES BE AS MUCH IN FAVOUR OF HAPPINESS
AS A VERY RESOLUTE CHARACTER.

THEY GOT ON FAST.  ANNE WAS ASTONISHED TO RECOGNISE THE SAME HILLS
AND THE SAME OBJECTS SO SOON.  THEIR ACTUAL SPEED, HEIGHTENED BY
SOME DREAD OF THE CONCLUSION, MADE THE ROAD APPEAR BUT HALF AS LONG
AS ON THE DAY BEFORE.  IT WAS GROWING QUITE DUSK, HOWEVER,
BEFORE THEY WERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF UPPERCROSS, AND THERE HAD BEEN
TOTAL SILENCE AMONG THEM FOR SOME TIME, HENRIETTA LEANING BACK
IN THE CORNER, WITH A SHAWL OVER HER FACE, GIVING THE HOPE OF HER
HAVING CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP; WHEN, AS THEY WERE GOING UP THEIR LAST HILL,
ANNE FOUND HERSELF ALL AT ONCE ADDRESSED BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.
IN A LOW, CAUTIOUS VOICE, HE SAID: --

"I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING WHAT WE HAD BEST DO.  SHE MUST NOT
APPEAR AT FIRST.  SHE COULD NOT STAND IT.  I HAVE BEEN THINKING WHETHER
YOU HAD NOT BETTER REMAIN IN THE CARRIAGE WITH HER, WHILE I GO IN
AND BREAK IT TO MR AND MRS MUSGROVE.  DO YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLAN?"

SHE DID:  HE WAS SATISFIED, AND SAID NO MORE.  BUT THE REMEMBRANCE
OF THE APPEAL REMAINED A PLEASURE TO HER, AS A PROOF OF FRIENDSHIP,
AND OF DEFERENCE FOR HER JUDGEMENT, A GREAT PLEASURE; AND WHEN IT BECAME
A SORT OF PARTING PROOF, ITS VALUE DID NOT LESSEN.

WHEN THE DISTRESSING COMMUNICATION AT UPPERCROSS WAS OVER,
AND HE HAD SEEN THE FATHER AND MOTHER QUITE AS COMPOSED AS COULD BE HOPED,
AND THE DAUGHTER ALL THE BETTER FOR BEING WITH THEM, HE ANNOUNCED
HIS INTENTION OF RETURNING IN THE SAME CARRIAGE TO LYME;
AND WHEN THE HORSES WERE BAITED, HE WAS OFF.

(END OF VOLUME ONE.)



CHAPTER 13


THE REMAINDER OF ANNE'S TIME AT UPPERCROSS, COMPREHENDING ONLY TWO DAYS,
WAS SPENT ENTIRELY AT THE MANSION HOUSE; AND SHE HAD THE SATISFACTION
OF KNOWING HERSELF EXTREMELY USEFUL THERE, BOTH AS AN IMMEDIATE COMPANION,
AND AS ASSISTING IN ALL THOSE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUTURE, WHICH,
IN MR AND MRS MUSGROVE'S DISTRESSED STATE OF SPIRITS, WOULD HAVE
BEEN DIFFICULTIES.

THEY HAD AN EARLY ACCOUNT FROM LYME THE NEXT MORNING.  LOUISA WAS
MUCH THE SAME.  NO SYMPTOMS WORSE THAN BEFORE HAD APPEARED.
CHARLES CAME A FEW HOURS AFTERWARDS, TO BRING A LATER AND
MORE PARTICULAR ACCOUNT.  HE WAS TOLERABLY CHEERFUL.  A SPEEDY CURE
MUST NOT BE HOPED, BUT EVERYTHING WAS GOING ON AS WELL
AS THE NATURE OF THE CASE ADMITTED.  IN SPEAKING OF THE HARVILLES,
HE SEEMED UNABLE TO SATISFY HIS OWN SENSE OF THEIR KINDNESS,
ESPECIALLY OF MRS HARVILLE'S EXERTIONS AS A NURSE.  "SHE REALLY LEFT
NOTHING FOR MARY TO DO.  HE AND MARY HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO GO EARLY
TO THEIR INN LAST NIGHT.  MARY HAD BEEN HYSTERICAL AGAIN THIS MORNING.
WHEN HE CAME AWAY, SHE WAS GOING TO WALK OUT WITH CAPTAIN BENWICK,
WHICH, HE HOPED, WOULD DO HER GOOD.  HE ALMOST WISHED SHE HAD BEEN
PREVAILED ON TO COME HOME THE DAY BEFORE; BUT THE TRUTH WAS,
THAT MRS HARVILLE LEFT NOTHING FOR ANYBODY TO DO."

CHARLES WAS TO RETURN TO LYME THE SAME AFTERNOON, AND HIS FATHER
HAD AT FIRST HALF A MIND TO GO WITH HIM, BUT THE LADIES COULD NOT CONSENT.
IT WOULD BE GOING ONLY TO MULTIPLY TROUBLE TO THE OTHERS,
AND INCREASE HIS OWN DISTRESS; AND A MUCH BETTER SCHEME FOLLOWED
AND WAS ACTED UPON.  A CHAISE WAS SENT FOR FROM CREWKHERNE,
AND CHARLES CONVEYED BACK A FAR MORE USEFUL PERSON IN THE OLD NURSERY-MAID
OF THE FAMILY, ONE WHO HAVING BROUGHT UP ALL THE CHILDREN,
AND SEEN THE VERY LAST, THE LINGERING AND LONG-PETTED MASTER HARRY,
SENT TO SCHOOL AFTER HIS BROTHERS, WAS NOW LIVING IN HER DESERTED NURSERY
TO MEND STOCKINGS AND DRESS ALL THE BLAINS AND BRUISES SHE COULD
GET NEAR HER, AND WHO, CONSEQUENTLY, WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY IN BEING
ALLOWED TO GO AND HELP NURSE DEAR MISS LOUISA.  VAGUE WISHES OF
GETTING SARAH THITHER, HAD OCCURRED BEFORE TO MRS MUSGROVE AND HENRIETTA;
BUT WITHOUT ANNE, IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN RESOLVED ON,
AND FOUND PRACTICABLE SO SOON.

THEY WERE INDEBTED, THE NEXT DAY, TO CHARLES HAYTER, FOR ALL
THE MINUTE KNOWLEDGE OF LOUISA, WHICH IT WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO OBTAIN
EVERY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.  HE MADE IT HIS BUSINESS TO GO TO LYME,
AND HIS ACCOUNT WAS STILL ENCOURAGING.  THE INTERVALS OF SENSE
AND CONSCIOUSNESS WERE BELIEVED TO BE STRONGER.  EVERY REPORT AGREED
IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S APPEARING FIXED IN LYME.

ANNE WAS TO LEAVE THEM ON THE MORROW, AN EVENT WHICH THEY ALL DREADED.
"WHAT SHOULD THEY DO WITHOUT HER?  THEY WERE WRETCHED COMFORTERS
FOR ONE ANOTHER."  AND SO MUCH WAS SAID IN THIS WAY, THAT ANNE THOUGHT
SHE COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN IMPART AMONG THEM THE GENERAL INCLINATION
TO WHICH SHE WAS PRIVY, AND PERSUADED THEM ALL TO GO TO LYME AT ONCE.
SHE HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY; IT WAS SOON DETERMINED THAT THEY WOULD GO;
GO TO-MORROW, FIX THEMSELVES AT THE INN, OR GET INTO LODGINGS,
AS IT SUITED, AND THERE REMAIN TILL DEAR LOUISA COULD BE MOVED.
THEY MUST BE TAKING OFF SOME TROUBLE FROM THE GOOD PEOPLE SHE WAS WITH;
THEY MIGHT AT LEAST RELIEVE MRS HARVILLE FROM THE CARE OF HER OWN CHILDREN;
AND IN SHORT, THEY WERE SO HAPPY IN THE DECISION, THAT ANNE WAS DELIGHTED
WITH WHAT SHE HAD DONE, AND FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEND HER
LAST MORNING AT UPPERCROSS BETTER THAN IN ASSISTING THEIR PREPARATIONS,
AND SENDING THEM OFF AT AN EARLY HOUR, THOUGH HER BEING LEFT
TO THE SOLITARY RANGE OF THE HOUSE WAS THE CONSEQUENCE.

SHE WAS THE LAST, EXCEPTING THE LITTLE BOYS AT THE COTTAGE,
SHE WAS THE VERY LAST, THE ONLY REMAINING ONE OF ALL THAT HAD FILLED
AND ANIMATED BOTH HOUSES, OF ALL THAT HAD GIVEN UPPERCROSS
ITS CHEERFUL CHARACTER.  A FEW DAYS HAD MADE A CHANGE INDEED!

IF LOUISA RECOVERED, IT WOULD ALL BE WELL AGAIN.  MORE THAN
FORMER HAPPINESS WOULD BE RESTORED.  THERE COULD NOT BE A DOUBT,
TO HER MIND THERE WAS NONE, OF WHAT WOULD FOLLOW HER RECOVERY.
A FEW MONTHS HENCE, AND THE ROOM NOW SO DESERTED, OCCUPIED BUT BY
HER SILENT, PENSIVE SELF, MIGHT BE FILLED AGAIN WITH ALL THAT WAS HAPPY
AND GAY, ALL THAT WAS GLOWING AND BRIGHT IN PROSPEROUS LOVE,
ALL THAT WAS MOST UNLIKE ANNE ELLIOT!

AN HOUR'S COMPLETE LEISURE FOR SUCH REFLECTIONS AS THESE,
ON A DARK NOVEMBER DAY, A SMALL THICK RAIN ALMOST BLOTTING OUT
THE VERY FEW OBJECTS EVER TO BE DISCERNED FROM THE WINDOWS, WAS ENOUGH
TO MAKE THE SOUND OF LADY RUSSELL'S CARRIAGE EXCEEDINGLY WELCOME;
AND YET, THOUGH DESIROUS TO BE GONE, SHE COULD NOT QUIT THE MANSION HOUSE,
OR LOOK AN ADIEU TO THE COTTAGE, WITH ITS BLACK, DRIPPING AND
COMFORTLESS VERANDA, OR EVEN NOTICE THROUGH THE MISTY GLASSES
THE LAST HUMBLE TENEMENTS OF THE VILLAGE, WITHOUT A SADDENED HEART.
SCENES HAD PASSED IN UPPERCROSS WHICH MADE IT PRECIOUS.
IT STOOD THE RECORD OF MANY SENSATIONS OF PAIN, ONCE SEVERE,
BUT NOW SOFTENED; AND OF SOME INSTANCES OF RELENTING FEELING,
SOME BREATHINGS OF FRIENDSHIP AND RECONCILIATION, WHICH COULD
NEVER BE LOOKED FOR AGAIN, AND WHICH COULD NEVER CEASE TO BE DEAR.
SHE LEFT IT ALL BEHIND HER, ALL BUT THE RECOLLECTION THAT
SUCH THINGS HAD BEEN.

ANNE HAD NEVER ENTERED KELLYNCH SINCE HER QUITTING LADY RUSSELL'S HOUSE
IN SEPTEMBER.  IT HAD NOT BEEN NECESSARY, AND THE FEW OCCASIONS OF
ITS BEING POSSIBLE FOR HER TO GO TO THE HALL SHE HAD CONTRIVED TO EVADE
AND ESCAPE FROM.  HER FIRST RETURN WAS TO RESUME HER PLACE IN THE MODERN
AND ELEGANT APARTMENTS OF THE LODGE, AND TO GLADDEN THE EYES
OF ITS MISTRESS.

THERE WAS SOME ANXIETY MIXED WITH LADY RUSSELL'S JOY IN MEETING HER.
SHE KNEW WHO HAD BEEN FREQUENTING UPPERCROSS.  BUT HAPPILY,
EITHER ANNE WAS IMPROVED IN PLUMPNESS AND LOOKS, OR LADY RUSSELL
FANCIED HER SO; AND ANNE, IN RECEIVING HER COMPLIMENTS ON THE OCCASION,
HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF CONNECTING THEM WITH THE SILENT ADMIRATION
OF HER COUSIN, AND OF HOPING THAT SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED WITH
A SECOND SPRING OF YOUTH AND BEAUTY.

WHEN THEY CAME TO CONVERSE, SHE WAS SOON SENSIBLE OF SOME MENTAL CHANGE.
THE SUBJECTS OF WHICH HER HEART HAD BEEN FULL ON LEAVING KELLYNCH,
AND WHICH SHE HAD FELT SLIGHTED, AND BEEN COMPELLED TO SMOTHER
AMONG THE MUSGROVES, WERE NOW BECOME BUT OF SECONDARY INTEREST.
SHE HAD LATELY LOST SIGHT EVEN OF HER FATHER AND SISTER AND BATH.
THEIR CONCERNS HAD BEEN SUNK UNDER THOSE OF UPPERCROSS;
AND WHEN LADY RUSSELL REVERTED TO THEIR FORMER HOPES AND FEARS,
AND SPOKE HER SATISFACTION IN THE HOUSE IN CAMDEN PLACE,
WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN, AND HER REGRET THAT MRS CLAY SHOULD STILL
BE WITH THEM, ANNE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO HAVE IT KNOWN
HOW MUCH MORE SHE WAS THINKING OF LYME AND LOUISA MUSGROVE,
AND ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE THERE; HOW MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO HER
WAS THE HOME AND THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE HARVILLES AND CAPTAIN BENWICK,
THAN HER OWN FATHER'S HOUSE IN CAMDEN PLACE, OR HER OWN SISTER'S INTIMACY
WITH MRS CLAY.  SHE WAS ACTUALLY FORCED TO EXERT HERSELF
TO MEET LADY RUSSELL WITH ANYTHING LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF EQUAL SOLICITUDE,
ON TOPICS WHICH HAD BY NATURE THE FIRST CLAIM ON HER.

THERE WAS A LITTLE AWKWARDNESS AT FIRST IN THEIR DISCOURSE
ON ANOTHER SUBJECT.  THEY MUST SPEAK OF THE ACCIDENT AT LYME.
LADY RUSSELL HAD NOT BEEN ARRIVED FIVE MINUTES THE DAY BEFORE,
WHEN A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE WHOLE HAD BURST ON HER; BUT STILL IT MUST
BE TALKED OF, SHE MUST MAKE ENQUIRIES, SHE MUST REGRET THE IMPRUDENCE,
LAMENT THE RESULT, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S NAME MUST BE MENTIONED BY BOTH.
ANNE WAS CONSCIOUS OF NOT DOING IT SO WELL AS LADY RUSSELL.
SHE COULD NOT SPEAK THE NAME, AND LOOK STRAIGHT FORWARD TO
LADY RUSSELL'S EYE, TILL SHE HAD ADOPTED THE EXPEDIENT OF TELLING HER
BRIEFLY WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THE ATTACHMENT BETWEEN HIM AND LOUISA.
WHEN THIS WAS TOLD, HIS NAME DISTRESSED HER NO LONGER.

LADY RUSSELL HAD ONLY TO LISTEN COMPOSEDLY, AND WISH THEM HAPPY,
BUT INTERNALLY HER HEART REVELLED IN ANGRY PLEASURE, IN PLEASED CONTEMPT,
THAT THE MAN WHO AT TWENTY-THREE HAD SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND SOMEWHAT
OF THE VALUE OF AN ANNE ELLIOT, SHOULD, EIGHT YEARS AFTERWARDS,
BE CHARMED BY A LOUISA MUSGROVE.

THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR DAYS PASSED MOST QUIETLY, WITH NO CIRCUMSTANCE
TO MARK THEM EXCEPTING THE RECEIPT OF A NOTE OR TWO FROM LYME,
WHICH FOUND THEIR WAY TO ANNE, SHE COULD NOT TELL HOW, AND BROUGHT
A RATHER IMPROVING ACCOUNT OF LOUISA.  AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD,
LADY RUSSELL'S POLITENESS COULD REPOSE NO LONGER, AND THE FAINTER
SELF-THREATENINGS OF THE PAST BECAME IN A DECIDED TONE,
"I MUST CALL ON MRS CROFT; I REALLY MUST CALL UPON HER SOON.
ANNE, HAVE YOU COURAGE TO GO WITH ME, AND PAY A VISIT IN THAT HOUSE?
IT WILL BE SOME TRIAL TO US BOTH."

ANNE DID NOT SHRINK FROM IT; ON THE CONTRARY, SHE TRULY FELT AS SHE SAID,
IN OBSERVING--

"I THINK YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO SUFFER THE MOST OF THE TWO;
YOUR FEELINGS ARE LESS RECONCILED TO THE CHANGE THAN MINE.
BY REMAINING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, I AM BECOME INURED TO IT."

SHE COULD HAVE SAID MORE ON THE SUBJECT; FOR SHE HAD IN FACT
SO HIGH AN OPINION OF THE CROFTS, AND CONSIDERED HER FATHER
SO VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS TENANTS, FELT THE PARISH TO BE SO SURE
OF A GOOD EXAMPLE, AND THE POOR OF THE BEST ATTENTION AND RELIEF,
THAT HOWEVER SORRY AND ASHAMED FOR THE NECESSITY OF THE REMOVAL,
SHE COULD NOT BUT IN CONSCIENCE FEEL THAT THEY WERE GONE
WHO DESERVED NOT TO STAY, AND THAT KELLYNCH HALL HAD PASSED
INTO BETTER HANDS THAN ITS OWNERS'.  THESE CONVICTIONS MUST UNQUESTIONABLY
HAVE THEIR OWN PAIN, AND SEVERE WAS ITS KIND; BUT THEY PRECLUDED
THAT PAIN WHICH LADY RUSSELL WOULD SUFFER IN ENTERING THE HOUSE AGAIN,
AND RETURNING THROUGH THE WELL-KNOWN APARTMENTS.

IN SUCH MOMENTS ANNE HAD NO POWER OF SAYING TO HERSELF,
"THESE ROOMS OUGHT TO BELONG ONLY TO US.  OH, HOW FALLEN
IN THEIR DESTINATION!  HOW UNWORTHILY OCCUPIED!  AN ANCIENT FAMILY
TO BE SO DRIVEN AWAY!  STRANGERS FILLING THEIR PLACE!"
NO, EXCEPT WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER MOTHER, AND REMEMBERED WHERE
SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND PRESIDE, SHE HAD NO SIGH OF THAT DESCRIPTION
TO HEAVE.

MRS CROFT ALWAYS MET HER WITH A KINDNESS WHICH GAVE HER THE PLEASURE
OF FANCYING HERSELF A FAVOURITE, AND ON THE PRESENT OCCASION,
RECEIVING HER IN THAT HOUSE, THERE WAS PARTICULAR ATTENTION.

THE SAD ACCIDENT AT LYME WAS SOON THE PREVAILING TOPIC,
AND ON COMPARING THEIR LATEST ACCOUNTS OF THE INVALID, IT APPEARED
THAT EACH LADY DATED HER INTELLIGENCE FROM THE SAME HOUR OF YESTERMORN;
THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD BEEN IN KELLYNCH YESTERDAY (THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THE ACCIDENT), HAD BROUGHT ANNE THE LAST NOTE, WHICH SHE HAD
NOT BEEN ABLE TO TRACE THE EXACT STEPS OF; HAD STAID A FEW HOURS
AND THEN RETURNED AGAIN TO LYME, AND WITHOUT ANY PRESENT INTENTION
OF QUITTING IT ANY MORE.  HE HAD ENQUIRED AFTER HER, SHE FOUND,
PARTICULARLY; HAD EXPRESSED HIS HOPE OF MISS ELLIOT'S NOT BEING
THE WORSE FOR HER EXERTIONS, AND HAD SPOKEN OF THOSE EXERTIONS AS GREAT.
THIS WAS HANDSOME, AND GAVE HER MORE PLEASURE THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE
COULD HAVE DONE.

AS TO THE SAD CATASTROPHE ITSELF, IT COULD BE CANVASSED ONLY IN ONE STYLE
BY A COUPLE OF STEADY, SENSIBLE WOMEN, WHOSE JUDGEMENTS HAD TO WORK
ON ASCERTAINED EVENTS; AND IT WAS PERFECTLY DECIDED THAT IT HAD BEEN
THE CONSEQUENCE OF MUCH THOUGHTLESSNESS AND MUCH IMPRUDENCE;
THAT ITS EFFECTS WERE MOST ALARMING, AND THAT IT WAS FRIGHTFUL TO THINK,
HOW LONG MISS MUSGROVE'S RECOVERY MIGHT YET BE DOUBTFUL, AND HOW LIABLE
SHE WOULD STILL REMAIN TO SUFFER FROM THE CONCUSSION HEREAFTER!
THE ADMIRAL WOUND IT UP SUMMARILY BY EXCLAIMING--

"AY, A VERY BAD BUSINESS INDEED.  A NEW SORT OF WAY THIS,
FOR A YOUNG FELLOW TO BE MAKING LOVE, BY BREAKING HIS MISTRESS'S HEAD,
IS NOT IT, MISS ELLIOT?  THIS IS BREAKING A HEAD AND GIVING A PLASTER,
TRULY!"

ADMIRAL CROFT'S MANNERS WERE NOT QUITE OF THE TONE TO SUIT LADY RUSSELL,
BUT THEY DELIGHTED ANNE.  HIS GOODNESS OF HEART AND SIMPLICITY
OF CHARACTER WERE IRRESISTIBLE.

"NOW, THIS MUST BE VERY BAD FOR YOU," SAID HE, SUDDENLY ROUSING FROM
A LITTLE REVERIE, "TO BE COMING AND FINDING US HERE.  I HAD NOT
RECOLLECTED IT BEFORE, I DECLARE, BUT IT MUST BE VERY BAD.
BUT NOW, DO NOT STAND UPON CEREMONY.  GET UP AND GO OVER ALL THE ROOMS
IN THE HOUSE IF YOU LIKE IT."

"ANOTHER TIME, SIR, I THANK YOU, NOT NOW."

"WELL, WHENEVER IT SUITS YOU.  YOU CAN SLIP IN FROM THE SHRUBBERY
AT ANY TIME; AND THERE YOU WILL FIND WE KEEP OUR UMBRELLAS HANGING UP
BY THAT DOOR.  A GOOD PLACE IS NOT IT?  BUT," (CHECKING HIMSELF),
"YOU WILL NOT THINK IT A GOOD PLACE, FOR YOURS WERE ALWAYS KEPT
IN THE BUTLER'S ROOM.  AY, SO IT ALWAYS IS, I BELIEVE.
ONE MAN'S WAYS MAY BE AS GOOD AS ANOTHER'S, BUT WE ALL LIKE OUR OWN BEST.
AND SO YOU MUST JUDGE FOR YOURSELF, WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU
TO GO ABOUT THE HOUSE OR NOT."

ANNE, FINDING SHE MIGHT DECLINE IT, DID SO, VERY GRATEFULLY.

"WE HAVE MADE VERY FEW CHANGES EITHER," CONTINUED THE ADMIRAL,
AFTER THINKING A MOMENT.  "VERY FEW.  WE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE LAUNDRY-DOOR,
AT UPPERCROSS.  THAT HAS BEEN A VERY GREAT IMPROVEMENT.
THE WONDER WAS, HOW ANY FAMILY UPON EARTH COULD BEAR WITH THE INCONVENIENCE
OF ITS OPENING AS IT DID, SO LONG!  YOU WILL TELL SIR WALTER
WHAT WE HAVE DONE, AND THAT MR SHEPHERD THINKS IT THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT
THE HOUSE EVER HAD.  INDEED, I MUST DO OURSELVES THE JUSTICE TO SAY,
THAT THE FEW ALTERATIONS WE HAVE MADE HAVE BEEN ALL VERY MUCH
FOR THE BETTER.  MY WIFE SHOULD HAVE THE CREDIT OF THEM, HOWEVER.
I HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE BESIDES SENDING AWAY SOME OF THE LARGE
LOOKING-GLASSES FROM MY DRESSING-ROOM, WHICH WAS YOUR FATHER'S.
A VERY GOOD MAN, AND VERY MUCH THE GENTLEMAN I AM SURE:
BUT I SHOULD THINK, MISS ELLIOT," (LOOKING WITH SERIOUS REFLECTION),
"I SHOULD THINK HE MUST BE RATHER A DRESSY MAN FOR HIS TIME OF LIFE.
SUCH A NUMBER OF LOOKING-GLASSES! OH LORD! THERE WAS NO GETTING AWAY
FROM ONE'S SELF.  SO I GOT SOPHY TO LEND ME A HAND, AND WE SOON
SHIFTED THEIR QUARTERS; AND NOW I AM QUITE SNUG, WITH MY
LITTLE SHAVING GLASS IN ONE CORNER, AND ANOTHER GREAT THING
THAT I NEVER GO NEAR."

ANNE, AMUSED IN SPITE OF HERSELF, WAS RATHER DISTRESSED FOR AN ANSWER,
AND THE ADMIRAL, FEARING HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN CIVIL ENOUGH,
TOOK UP THE SUBJECT AGAIN, TO SAY--

"THE NEXT TIME YOU WRITE TO YOUR GOOD FATHER, MISS ELLIOT,
PRAY GIVE HIM MY COMPLIMENTS AND MRS CROFT'S, AND SAY THAT WE ARE
SETTLED HERE QUITE TO OUR LIKING, AND HAVE NO FAULT AT ALL TO FIND
WITH THE PLACE.  THE BREAKFAST-ROOM CHIMNEY SMOKES A LITTLE,
I GRANT YOU, BUT IT IS ONLY WHEN THE WIND IS DUE NORTH AND BLOWS HARD,
WHICH MAY NOT HAPPEN THREE TIMES A WINTER.  AND TAKE IT ALTOGETHER,
NOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN INTO MOST OF THE HOUSES HEREABOUTS AND CAN JUDGE,
THERE IS NOT ONE THAT WE LIKE BETTER THAN THIS.  PRAY SAY SO,
WITH MY COMPLIMENTS.  HE WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR IT."

LADY RUSSELL AND MRS CROFT WERE VERY WELL PLEASED WITH EACH OTHER:
BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE WHICH THIS VISIT BEGAN WAS FATED NOT TO PROCEED
FAR AT PRESENT; FOR WHEN IT WAS RETURNED, THE CROFTS ANNOUNCED
THEMSELVES TO BE GOING AWAY FOR A FEW WEEKS, TO VISIT THEIR CONNEXIONS
IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTY, AND PROBABLY MIGHT NOT BE AT HOME AGAIN
BEFORE LADY RUSSELL WOULD BE REMOVING TO BATH.

SO ENDED ALL DANGER TO ANNE OF MEETING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AT KELLYNCH HALL,
OR OF SEEING HIM IN COMPANY WITH HER FRIEND.  EVERYTHING WAS SAFE ENOUGH,
AND SHE SMILED OVER THE MANY ANXIOUS FEELINGS SHE HAD WASTED
ON THE SUBJECT.



CHAPTER 14


THOUGH CHARLES AND MARY HAD REMAINED AT LYME MUCH LONGER AFTER
MR AND MRS MUSGROVE'S GOING THAN ANNE CONCEIVED THEY COULD HAVE BEEN
AT ALL WANTED, THEY WERE YET THE FIRST OF THE FAMILY TO BE AT HOME AGAIN;
AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THEIR RETURN TO UPPERCROSS
THEY DROVE OVER TO THE LODGE.  THEY HAD LEFT LOUISA BEGINNING TO SIT UP;
BUT HER HEAD, THOUGH CLEAR, WAS EXCEEDINGLY WEAK, AND HER NERVES
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE HIGHEST EXTREME OF TENDERNESS; AND THOUGH
SHE MIGHT BE PRONOUNCED TO BE ALTOGETHER DOING VERY WELL,
IT WAS STILL IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHEN SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BEAR
THE REMOVAL HOME; AND HER FATHER AND MOTHER, WHO MUST RETURN
IN TIME TO RECEIVE THEIR YOUNGER CHILDREN FOR THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS,
HAD HARDLY A HOPE OF BEING ALLOWED TO BRING HER WITH THEM.

THEY HAD BEEN ALL IN LODGINGS TOGETHER.  MRS MUSGROVE HAD
GOT MRS HARVILLE'S CHILDREN AWAY AS MUCH AS SHE COULD, EVERY POSSIBLE
SUPPLY FROM UPPERCROSS HAD BEEN FURNISHED, TO LIGHTEN THE INCONVENIENCE
TO THE HARVILLES, WHILE THE HARVILLES HAD BEEN WANTING THEM
TO COME TO DINNER EVERY DAY; AND IN SHORT, IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN
ONLY A STRUGGLE ON EACH SIDE AS TO WHICH SHOULD BE MOST DISINTERESTED
AND HOSPITABLE.

MARY HAD HAD HER EVILS; BUT UPON THE WHOLE, AS WAS EVIDENT
BY HER STAYING SO LONG, SHE HAD FOUND MORE TO ENJOY THAN TO SUFFER.
CHARLES HAYTER HAD BEEN AT LYME OFTENER THAN SUITED HER; AND WHEN
THEY DINED WITH THE HARVILLES THERE HAD BEEN ONLY A MAID-SERVANT TO WAIT,
AND AT FIRST MRS HARVILLE HAD ALWAYS GIVEN MRS MUSGROVE PRECEDENCE;
BUT THEN, SHE HAD RECEIVED SO VERY HANDSOME AN APOLOGY FROM HER
ON FINDING OUT WHOSE DAUGHTER SHE WAS, AND THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH
GOING ON EVERY DAY, THERE HAD BEEN SO MANY WALKS BETWEEN THEIR LODGINGS
AND THE HARVILLES, AND SHE HAD GOT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY,
AND CHANGED THEM SO OFTEN, THAT THE BALANCE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN
MUCH IN FAVOUR OF LYME.  SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO CHARMOUTH TOO,
AND SHE HAD BATHED, AND SHE HAD GONE TO CHURCH, AND THERE WERE A GREAT MANY
MORE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT IN THE CHURCH AT LYME THAN AT UPPERCROSS;
AND ALL THIS, JOINED TO THE SENSE OF BEING SO VERY USEFUL,
HAD MADE REALLY AN AGREEABLE FORTNIGHT.

ANNE ENQUIRED AFTER CAPTAIN BENWICK, MARY'S FACE WAS CLOUDED DIRECTLY.
CHARLES LAUGHED.

"OH! CAPTAIN BENWICK IS VERY WELL, I BELIEVE, BUT HE IS
A VERY ODD YOUNG MAN.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE WOULD BE AT.
WE ASKED HIM TO COME HOME WITH US FOR A DAY OR TWO:  CHARLES UNDERTOOK
TO GIVE HIM SOME SHOOTING, AND HE SEEMED QUITE DELIGHTED, AND, FOR MY PART,
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL SETTLED; WHEN BEHOLD! ON TUESDAY NIGHT,
HE MADE A VERY AWKWARD SORT OF EXCUSE; `HE NEVER SHOT' AND HE HAD
`BEEN QUITE MISUNDERSTOOD,' AND HE HAD PROMISED THIS AND HE HAD
PROMISED THAT, AND THE END OF IT WAS, I FOUND, THAT HE DID NOT MEAN TO COME.
I SUPPOSE HE WAS AFRAID OF FINDING IT DULL; BUT UPON MY WORD
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE LIVELY ENOUGH AT THE COTTAGE
FOR SUCH A HEART-BROKEN MAN AS CAPTAIN BENWICK."

CHARLES LAUGHED AGAIN AND SAID, "NOW MARY, YOU KNOW VERY WELL
HOW IT REALLY WAS.  IT WAS ALL YOUR DOING," (TURNING TO ANNE.)
"HE FANCIED THAT IF HE WENT WITH US, HE SHOULD FIND YOU CLOSE BY:
HE FANCIED EVERYBODY TO BE LIVING IN UPPERCROSS; AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED
THAT LADY RUSSELL LIVED THREE MILES OFF, HIS HEART FAILED HIM,
AND HE HAD NOT COURAGE TO COME.  THAT IS THE FACT, UPON MY HONOUR,
MARY KNOWS IT IS."

BUT MARY DID NOT GIVE INTO IT VERY GRACIOUSLY, WHETHER FROM
NOT CONSIDERING CAPTAIN BENWICK ENTITLED BY BIRTH AND SITUATION
TO BE IN LOVE WITH AN ELLIOT, OR FROM NOT WANTING TO BELIEVE
ANNE A GREATER ATTRACTION TO UPPERCROSS THAN HERSELF, MUST BE
LEFT TO BE GUESSED.  ANNE'S GOOD-WILL, HOWEVER, WAS NOT TO BE LESSENED
BY WHAT SHE HEARD.  SHE BOLDLY ACKNOWLEDGED HERSELF FLATTERED,
AND CONTINUED HER ENQUIRIES.

"OH! HE TALKS OF YOU," CRIED CHARLES, "IN SUCH TERMS--"
MARY INTERRUPTED HIM. "I DECLARE, CHARLES, I NEVER HEARD HIM
MENTION ANNE TWICE ALL THE TIME I WAS THERE.  I DECLARE, ANNE,
HE NEVER TALKS OF YOU AT ALL."

"NO," ADMITTED CHARLES, "I DO NOT KNOW THAT HE EVER DOES, IN A GENERAL
WAY; BUT HOWEVER, IT IS A VERY CLEAR THING THAT HE ADMIRES YOU EXCEEDINGLY.
HIS HEAD IS FULL OF SOME BOOKS THAT HE IS READING UPON YOUR RECOMMENDATION,
AND HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THEM; HE HAS FOUND OUT SOMETHING OR OTHER
IN ONE OF THEM WHICH HE THINKS--OH! I CANNOT PRETEND TO REMEMBER IT,
BUT IT WAS SOMETHING VERY FINE--I OVERHEARD HIM TELLING HENRIETTA
ALL ABOUT IT; AND THEN `MISS ELLIOT' WAS SPOKEN OF IN THE HIGHEST TERMS!
NOW MARY, I DECLARE IT WAS SO, I HEARD IT MYSELF, AND YOU WERE
IN THE OTHER ROOM.  `ELEGANCE, SWEETNESS, BEAUTY.' OH! THERE WAS NO END
OF MISS ELLIOT'S CHARMS."

"AND I AM SURE," CRIED MARY, WARMLY, "IT WAS A VERY LITTLE TO HIS CREDIT,
IF HE DID.  MISS HARVILLE ONLY DIED LAST JUNE.  SUCH A HEART
IS VERY LITTLE WORTH HAVING; IS IT, LADY RUSSELL?  I AM SURE
YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME."

"I MUST SEE CAPTAIN BENWICK BEFORE I DECIDE," SAID LADY RUSSELL, SMILING.

"AND THAT YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO DO VERY SOON, I CAN TELL YOU, MA'AM,"
SAID CHARLES.  "THOUGH HE HAD NOT NERVES FOR COMING AWAY WITH US,
AND SETTING OFF AGAIN AFTERWARDS TO PAY A FORMAL VISIT HERE,
HE WILL MAKE HIS WAY OVER TO KELLYNCH ONE DAY BY HIMSELF,
YOU MAY DEPEND ON IT.  I TOLD HIM THE DISTANCE AND THE ROAD,
AND I TOLD HIM OF THE CHURCH'S BEING SO VERY WELL WORTH SEEING;
FOR AS HE HAS A TASTE FOR THOSE SORT OF THINGS, I THOUGHT THAT WOULD
BE A GOOD EXCUSE, AND HE LISTENED WITH ALL HIS UNDERSTANDING AND SOUL;
AND I AM SURE FROM HIS MANNER THAT YOU WILL HAVE HIM CALLING HERE SOON.
SO, I GIVE YOU NOTICE, LADY RUSSELL."

"ANY ACQUAINTANCE OF ANNE'S WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOME TO ME,"
WAS LADY RUSSELL'S KIND ANSWER.

"OH! AS TO BEING ANNE'S ACQUAINTANCE," SAID MARY, "I THINK HE IS RATHER
MY ACQUAINTANCE, FOR I HAVE BEEN SEEING HIM EVERY DAY THIS LAST FORTNIGHT."

"WELL, AS YOUR JOINT ACQUAINTANCE, THEN, I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY
TO SEE CAPTAIN BENWICK."

"YOU WILL NOT FIND ANYTHING VERY AGREEABLE IN HIM, I ASSURE YOU, MA'AM.
HE IS ONE OF THE DULLEST YOUNG MEN THAT EVER LIVED.  HE HAS WALKED WITH ME,
SOMETIMES, FROM ONE END OF THE SANDS TO THE OTHER, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD.
HE IS NOT AT ALL A WELL-BRED YOUNG MAN.  I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT LIKE HIM."

"THERE WE DIFFER, MARY," SAID ANNE.  "I THINK LADY RUSSELL WOULD LIKE HIM.
I THINK SHE WOULD BE SO MUCH PLEASED WITH HIS MIND, THAT SHE WOULD
VERY SOON SEE NO DEFICIENCY IN HIS MANNER."

"SO DO I, ANNE," SAID CHARLES.  "I AM SURE LADY RUSSELL WOULD LIKE HIM.
HE IS JUST LADY RUSSELL'S SORT.  GIVE HIM A BOOK, AND HE WILL
READ ALL DAY LONG."

"YES, THAT HE WILL!" EXCLAIMED MARY, TAUNTINGLY.  "HE WILL SIT PORING
OVER HIS BOOK, AND NOT KNOW WHEN A PERSON SPEAKS TO HIM, OR WHEN ONE
DROP'S ONE'S SCISSORS, OR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS.  DO YOU THINK
LADY RUSSELL WOULD LIKE THAT?"

LADY RUSSELL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING.  "UPON MY WORD," SAID SHE,
"I SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT MY OPINION OF ANY ONE COULD HAVE
ADMITTED OF SUCH DIFFERENCE OF CONJECTURE, STEADY AND MATTER OF FACT
AS I MAY CALL MYSELF.  I HAVE REALLY A CURIOSITY TO SEE THE PERSON
WHO CAN GIVE OCCASION TO SUCH DIRECTLY OPPOSITE NOTIONS.
I WISH HE MAY BE INDUCED TO CALL HERE.  AND WHEN HE DOES, MARY,
YOU MAY DEPEND UPON HEARING MY OPINION; BUT I AM DETERMINED
NOT TO JUDGE HIM BEFOREHAND."

"YOU WILL NOT LIKE HIM, I WILL ANSWER FOR IT."

LADY RUSSELL BEGAN TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE.  MARY SPOKE WITH ANIMATION
OF THEIR MEETING WITH, OR RATHER MISSING, MR ELLIOT SO EXTRAORDINARILY.

"HE IS A MAN," SAID LADY RUSSELL, "WHOM I HAVE NO WISH TO SEE.
HIS DECLINING TO BE ON CORDIAL TERMS WITH THE HEAD OF HIS FAMILY,
HAS LEFT A VERY STRONG IMPRESSION IN HIS DISFAVOUR WITH ME."

THIS DECISION CHECKED MARY'S EAGERNESS, AND STOPPED HER SHORT
IN THE MIDST OF THE ELLIOT COUNTENANCE.

WITH REGARD TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, THOUGH ANNE HAZARDED NO ENQUIRIES,
THERE WAS VOLUNTARY COMMUNICATION SUFFICIENT.  HIS SPIRITS HAD BEEN
GREATLY RECOVERING LATELY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED.  AS LOUISA IMPROVED,
HE HAD IMPROVED, AND HE WAS NOW QUITE A DIFFERENT CREATURE
FROM WHAT HE HAD BEEN THE FIRST WEEK.  HE HAD NOT SEEN LOUISA;
AND WAS SO EXTREMELY FEARFUL OF ANY ILL CONSEQUENCE TO HER
FROM AN INTERVIEW, THAT HE DID NOT PRESS FOR IT AT ALL; AND,
ON THE CONTRARY, SEEMED TO HAVE A PLAN OF GOING AWAY FOR A WEEK
OR TEN DAYS, TILL HER HEAD WAS STRONGER.  HE HAD TALKED OF GOING
DOWN TO PLYMOUTH FOR A WEEK, AND WANTED TO PERSUADE CAPTAIN BENWICK
TO GO WITH HIM; BUT, AS CHARLES MAINTAINED TO THE LAST, CAPTAIN BENWICK
SEEMED MUCH MORE DISPOSED TO RIDE OVER TO KELLYNCH.

THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT LADY RUSSELL AND ANNE WERE BOTH
OCCASIONALLY THINKING OF CAPTAIN BENWICK, FROM THIS TIME.
LADY RUSSELL COULD NOT HEAR THE DOOR-BELL WITHOUT FEELING THAT IT MIGHT
BE HIS HERALD; NOR COULD ANNE RETURN FROM ANY STROLL OF SOLITARY INDULGENCE
IN HER FATHER'S GROUNDS, OR ANY VISIT OF CHARITY IN THE VILLAGE,
WITHOUT WONDERING WHETHER SHE MIGHT SEE HIM OR HEAR OF HIM.
CAPTAIN BENWICK CAME NOT, HOWEVER.  HE WAS EITHER LESS DISPOSED FOR IT
THAN CHARLES HAD IMAGINED, OR HE WAS TOO SHY; AND AFTER GIVING HIM
A WEEK'S INDULGENCE, LADY RUSSELL DETERMINED HIM TO BE UNWORTHY
OF THE INTEREST WHICH HE HAD BEEN BEGINNING TO EXCITE.

THE MUSGROVES CAME BACK TO RECEIVE THEIR HAPPY BOYS AND GIRLS FROM SCHOOL,
BRINGING WITH THEM MRS HARVILLE'S LITTLE CHILDREN, TO IMPROVE THE NOISE
OF UPPERCROSS, AND LESSEN THAT OF LYME.  HENRIETTA REMAINED WITH LOUISA;
BUT ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE AGAIN IN THEIR USUAL QUARTERS.

LADY RUSSELL AND ANNE PAID THEIR COMPLIMENTS TO THEM ONCE,
WHEN ANNE COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT UPPERCROSS WAS ALREADY QUITE ALIVE AGAIN.
THOUGH NEITHER HENRIETTA, NOR LOUISA, NOR CHARLES HAYTER,
NOR CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WERE THERE, THE ROOM PRESENTED AS STRONG A CONTRAST
AS COULD BE WISHED TO THE LAST STATE SHE HAD SEEN IT IN.

IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING MRS MUSGROVE WERE THE LITTLE HARVILLES,
WHOM SHE WAS SEDULOUSLY GUARDING FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE TWO CHILDREN
FROM THE COTTAGE, EXPRESSLY ARRIVED TO AMUSE THEM.  ON ONE SIDE
WAS A TABLE OCCUPIED BY SOME CHATTERING GIRLS, CUTTING UP SILK
AND GOLD PAPER; AND ON THE OTHER WERE TRESSELS AND TRAYS,
BENDING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF BRAWN AND COLD PIES, WHERE RIOTOUS BOYS
WERE HOLDING HIGH REVEL; THE WHOLE COMPLETED BY A ROARING CHRISTMAS FIRE,
WHICH SEEMED DETERMINED TO BE HEARD, IN SPITE OF ALL THE NOISE
OF THE OTHERS.  CHARLES AND MARY ALSO CAME IN, OF COURSE,
DURING THEIR VISIT, AND MR MUSGROVE MADE A POINT OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS
TO LADY RUSSELL, AND SAT DOWN CLOSE TO HER FOR TEN MINUTES,
TALKING WITH A VERY RAISED VOICE, BUT FROM THE CLAMOUR OF THE CHILDREN
ON HIS KNEES, GENERALLY IN VAIN.  IT WAS A FINE FAMILY-PIECE.

ANNE, JUDGING FROM HER OWN TEMPERAMENT, WOULD HAVE DEEMED
SUCH A DOMESTIC HURRICANE A BAD RESTORATIVE OF THE NERVES,
WHICH LOUISA'S ILLNESS MUST HAVE SO GREATLY SHAKEN.  BUT MRS MUSGROVE,
WHO GOT ANNE NEAR HER ON PURPOSE TO THANK HER MOST CORDIALLY,
AGAIN AND AGAIN, FOR ALL HER ATTENTIONS TO THEM, CONCLUDED
A SHORT RECAPITULATION OF WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED HERSELF BY OBSERVING,
WITH A HAPPY GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM, THAT AFTER ALL SHE HAD GONE THROUGH,
NOTHING WAS SO LIKELY TO DO HER GOOD AS A LITTLE QUIET CHEERFULNESS
AT HOME.

LOUISA WAS NOW RECOVERING APACE.  HER MOTHER COULD EVEN THINK OF HER
BEING ABLE TO JOIN THEIR PARTY AT HOME, BEFORE HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
WENT TO SCHOOL AGAIN.  THE HARVILLES HAD PROMISED TO COME WITH HER
AND STAY AT UPPERCROSS, WHENEVER SHE RETURNED.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS GONE,
FOR THE PRESENT, TO SEE HIS BROTHER IN SHROPSHIRE.

"I HOPE I SHALL REMEMBER, IN FUTURE," SAID LADY RUSSELL, AS SOON AS
THEY WERE RESEATED IN THE CARRIAGE, "NOT TO CALL AT UPPERCROSS
IN THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS."

EVERYBODY HAS THEIR TASTE IN NOISES AS WELL AS IN OTHER MATTERS;
AND SOUNDS ARE QUITE INNOXIOUS, OR MOST DISTRESSING, BY THEIR SORT
RATHER THAN THEIR QUANTITY.  WHEN LADY RUSSELL NOT LONG AFTERWARDS,
WAS ENTERING BATH ON A WET AFTERNOON, AND DRIVING THROUGH
THE LONG COURSE OF STREETS FROM THE OLD BRIDGE TO CAMDEN PLACE,
AMIDST THE DASH OF OTHER CARRIAGES, THE HEAVY RUMBLE OF CARTS AND DRAYS,
THE BAWLING OF NEWSPAPERMEN, MUFFIN-MEN AND MILKMEN, AND THE CEASELESS
CLINK OF PATTENS, SHE MADE NO COMPLAINT.  NO, THESE WERE NOISES
WHICH BELONGED TO THE WINTER PLEASURES; HER SPIRITS ROSE
UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE; AND LIKE MRS MUSGROVE, SHE WAS FEELING,
THOUGH NOT SAYING, THAT AFTER BEING LONG IN THE COUNTRY, NOTHING COULD BE
SO GOOD FOR HER AS A LITTLE QUIET CHEERFULNESS.

ANNE DID NOT SHARE THESE FEELINGS.  SHE PERSISTED IN A VERY DETERMINED,
THOUGH VERY SILENT DISINCLINATION FOR BATH; CAUGHT THE FIRST DIM VIEW
OF THE EXTENSIVE BUILDINGS, SMOKING IN RAIN, WITHOUT ANY WISH
OF SEEING THEM BETTER; FELT THEIR PROGRESS THROUGH THE STREETS TO BE,
HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE, YET TOO RAPID; FOR WHO WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER
WHEN SHE ARRIVED?  AND LOOKED BACK, WITH FOND REGRET, TO THE BUSTLES
OF UPPERCROSS AND THE SECLUSION OF KELLYNCH.

ELIZABETH'S LAST LETTER HAD COMMUNICATED A PIECE OF NEWS OF SOME INTEREST.
MR ELLIOT WAS IN BATH.  HE HAD CALLED IN CAMDEN PLACE; HAD CALLED
A SECOND TIME, A THIRD; HAD BEEN POINTEDLY ATTENTIVE.  IF ELIZABETH
AND HER FATHER DID NOT DECEIVE THEMSELVES, HAD BEEN TAKING MUCH PAINS
TO SEEK THE ACQUAINTANCE, AND PROCLAIM THE VALUE OF THE CONNECTION,
AS HE HAD FORMERLY TAKEN PAINS TO SHEW NEGLECT.  THIS WAS VERY WONDERFUL
IF IT WERE TRUE; AND LADY RUSSELL WAS IN A STATE OF VERY AGREEABLE
CURIOSITY AND PERPLEXITY ABOUT MR ELLIOT, ALREADY RECANTING THE SENTIMENT
SHE HAD SO LATELY EXPRESSED TO MARY, OF HIS BEING "A MAN WHOM SHE HAD
NO WISH TO SEE."  SHE HAD A GREAT WISH TO SEE HIM.  IF HE REALLY SOUGHT
TO RECONCILE HIMSELF LIKE A DUTIFUL BRANCH, HE MUST BE FORGIVEN
FOR HAVING DISMEMBERED HIMSELF FROM THE PATERNAL TREE.

ANNE WAS NOT ANIMATED TO AN EQUAL PITCH BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE,
BUT SHE FELT THAT SHE WOULD RATHER SEE MR ELLIOT AGAIN THAN NOT,
WHICH WAS MORE THAN SHE COULD SAY FOR MANY OTHER PERSONS IN BATH.

SHE WAS PUT DOWN IN CAMDEN PLACE; AND LADY RUSSELL THEN DROVE
TO HER OWN LODGINGS, IN RIVERS STREET.



CHAPTER 15


SIR WALTER HAD TAKEN A VERY GOOD HOUSE IN CAMDEN PLACE,
A LOFTY DIGNIFIED SITUATION, SUCH AS BECOMES A MAN OF CONSEQUENCE;
AND BOTH HE AND ELIZABETH WERE SETTLED THERE, MUCH TO THEIR SATISFACTION.

ANNE ENTERED IT WITH A SINKING HEART, ANTICIPATING AN IMPRISONMENT
OF MANY MONTHS, AND ANXIOUSLY SAYING TO HERSELF, "OH! WHEN SHALL I
LEAVE YOU AGAIN?"  A DEGREE OF UNEXPECTED CORDIALITY, HOWEVER,
IN THE WELCOME SHE RECEIVED, DID HER GOOD.  HER FATHER AND SISTER
WERE GLAD TO SEE HER, FOR THE SAKE OF SHEWING HER THE HOUSE AND FURNITURE,
AND MET HER WITH KINDNESS.  HER MAKING A FOURTH, WHEN THEY
SAT DOWN TO DINNER, WAS NOTICED AS AN ADVANTAGE.

MRS CLAY WAS VERY PLEASANT, AND VERY SMILING, BUT HER COURTESIES AND SMILES
WERE MORE A MATTER OF COURSE.  ANNE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT SHE WOULD
PRETEND WHAT WAS PROPER ON HER ARRIVAL, BUT THE COMPLAISANCE OF THE OTHERS
WAS UNLOOKED FOR.  THEY WERE EVIDENTLY IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS,
AND SHE WAS SOON TO LISTEN TO THE CAUSES.  THEY HAD NO INCLINATION
TO LISTEN TO HER.  AFTER LAYING OUT FOR SOME COMPLIMENTS OF BEING
DEEPLY REGRETTED IN THEIR OLD NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHICH ANNE COULD NOT PAY,
THEY HAD ONLY A FEW FAINT ENQUIRIES TO MAKE, BEFORE THE TALK MUST BE
ALL THEIR OWN.  UPPERCROSS EXCITED NO INTEREST, KELLYNCH VERY LITTLE:
IT WAS ALL BATH.

THEY HAD THE PLEASURE OF ASSURING HER THAT BATH MORE THAN ANSWERED
THEIR EXPECTATIONS IN EVERY RESPECT.  THEIR HOUSE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY
THE BEST IN CAMDEN PLACE; THEIR DRAWING-ROOMS HAD MANY DECIDED ADVANTAGES
OVER ALL THE OTHERS WHICH THEY HAD EITHER SEEN OR HEARD OF,
AND THE SUPERIORITY WAS NOT LESS IN THE STYLE OF THE FITTING-UP,
OR THE TASTE OF THE FURNITURE.  THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WAS
EXCEEDINGLY SOUGHT AFTER.  EVERYBODY WAS WANTING TO VISIT THEM.
THEY HAD DRAWN BACK FROM MANY INTRODUCTIONS, AND STILL WERE
PERPETUALLY HAVING CARDS LEFT BY PEOPLE OF WHOM THEY KNEW NOTHING.

HERE WERE FUNDS OF ENJOYMENT.  COULD ANNE WONDER THAT HER FATHER
AND SISTER WERE HAPPY?  SHE MIGHT NOT WONDER, BUT SHE MUST SIGH
THAT HER FATHER SHOULD FEEL NO DEGRADATION IN HIS CHANGE, SHOULD SEE
NOTHING TO REGRET IN THE DUTIES AND DIGNITY OF THE RESIDENT LANDHOLDER,
SHOULD FIND SO MUCH TO BE VAIN OF IN THE LITTLENESSES OF A TOWN;
AND SHE MUST SIGH, AND SMILE, AND WONDER TOO, AS ELIZABETH THREW OPEN
THE FOLDING-DOORS AND WALKED WITH EXULTATION FROM ONE DRAWING-ROOM
TO THE OTHER, BOASTING OF THEIR SPACE; AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT WOMAN,
WHO HAD BEEN MISTRESS OF KELLYNCH HALL, FINDING EXTENT TO BE PROUD OF
BETWEEN TWO WALLS, PERHAPS THIRTY FEET ASUNDER.

BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL WHICH THEY HAD TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.
THEY HAD MR ELLIOT TOO.  ANNE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO HEAR OF MR ELLIOT.
HE WAS NOT ONLY PARDONED, THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH HIM.
HE HAD BEEN IN BATH ABOUT A FORTNIGHT; (HE HAD PASSED THROUGH BATH
IN NOVEMBER, IN HIS WAY TO LONDON, WHEN THE INTELLIGENCE OF
SIR WALTER'S BEING SETTLED THERE HAD OF COURSE REACHED HIM,
THOUGH ONLY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IN THE PLACE, BUT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE
TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF IT;) BUT HE HAD NOW BEEN A FORTNIGHT IN BATH,
AND HIS FIRST OBJECT ON ARRIVING, HAD BEEN TO LEAVE HIS CARD
IN CAMDEN PLACE, FOLLOWING IT UP BY SUCH ASSIDUOUS ENDEAVOURS TO MEET,
AND WHEN THEY DID MEET, BY SUCH GREAT OPENNESS OF CONDUCT,
SUCH READINESS TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE PAST, SUCH SOLICITUDE TO BE RECEIVED
AS A RELATION AGAIN, THAT THEIR FORMER GOOD UNDERSTANDING
WAS COMPLETELY RE-ESTABLISHED.

THEY HAD NOT A FAULT TO FIND IN HIM.  HE HAD EXPLAINED AWAY
ALL THE APPEARANCE OF NEGLECT ON HIS OWN SIDE.  IT HAD ORIGINATED
IN MISAPPREHENSION ENTIRELY.  HE HAD NEVER HAD AN IDEA OF
THROWING HIMSELF OFF; HE HAD FEARED THAT HE WAS THROWN OFF,
BUT KNEW NOT WHY, AND DELICACY HAD KEPT HIM SILENT.  UPON THE HINT
OF HAVING SPOKEN DISRESPECTFULLY OR CARELESSLY OF THE FAMILY
AND THE FAMILY HONOURS, HE WAS QUITE INDIGNANT.  HE, WHO HAD EVER BOASTED
OF BEING AN ELLIOT, AND WHOSE FEELINGS, AS TO CONNECTION,
WERE ONLY TOO STRICT TO SUIT THE UNFEUDAL TONE OF THE PRESENT DAY.
HE WAS ASTONISHED, INDEED, BUT HIS CHARACTER AND GENERAL CONDUCT
MUST REFUTE IT.  HE COULD REFER SIR WALTER TO ALL WHO KNEW HIM;
AND CERTAINLY, THE PAINS HE HAD BEEN TAKING ON THIS, THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
OF RECONCILIATION, TO BE RESTORED TO THE FOOTING OF A RELATION
AND HEIR-PRESUMPTIVE, WAS A STRONG PROOF OF HIS OPINIONS ON THE SUBJECT.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS MARRIAGE, TOO, WERE FOUND TO ADMIT OF
MUCH EXTENUATION.  THIS WAS AN ARTICLE NOT TO BE ENTERED ON BY HIMSELF;
BUT A VERY INTIMATE FRIEND OF HIS, A COLONEL WALLIS, A HIGHLY
RESPECTABLE MAN, PERFECTLY THE GENTLEMAN, (AND NOT AN ILL-LOOKING MAN,
SIR WALTER ADDED), WHO WAS LIVING IN VERY GOOD STYLE IN MARLBOROUGH
BUILDINGS, AND HAD, AT HIS OWN PARTICULAR REQUEST, BEEN ADMITTED
TO THEIR ACQUAINTANCE THROUGH MR ELLIOT, HAD MENTIONED ONE OR TWO THINGS
RELATIVE TO THE MARRIAGE, WHICH MADE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE
IN THE DISCREDIT OF IT.

COLONEL WALLIS HAD KNOWN MR ELLIOT LONG, HAD BEEN WELL ACQUAINTED
ALSO WITH HIS WIFE, HAD PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE STORY.
SHE WAS CERTAINLY NOT A WOMAN OF FAMILY, BUT WELL EDUCATED,
ACCOMPLISHED, RICH, AND EXCESSIVELY IN LOVE WITH HIS FRIEND.
THERE HAD BEEN THE CHARM.  SHE HAD SOUGHT HIM.  WITHOUT THAT ATTRACTION,
NOT ALL HER MONEY WOULD HAVE TEMPTED ELLIOT, AND SIR WALTER WAS,
MOREOVER, ASSURED OF HER HAVING BEEN A VERY FINE WOMAN.
HERE WAS A GREAT DEAL TO SOFTEN THE BUSINESS.  A VERY FINE WOMAN
WITH A LARGE FORTUNE, IN LOVE WITH HIM!  SIR WALTER SEEMED TO ADMIT IT
AS COMPLETE APOLOGY; AND THOUGH ELIZABETH COULD NOT SEE THE CIRCUMSTANCE
IN QUITE SO FAVOURABLE A LIGHT, SHE ALLOWED IT BE A GREAT EXTENUATION.

MR ELLIOT HAD CALLED REPEATEDLY, HAD DINED WITH THEM ONCE,
EVIDENTLY DELIGHTED BY THE DISTINCTION OF BEING ASKED, FOR THEY
GAVE NO DINNERS IN GENERAL; DELIGHTED, IN SHORT, BY EVERY PROOF
OF COUSINLY NOTICE, AND PLACING HIS WHOLE HAPPINESS IN BEING
ON INTIMATE TERMS IN CAMDEN PLACE.

ANNE LISTENED, BUT WITHOUT QUITE UNDERSTANDING IT.  ALLOWANCES,
LARGE ALLOWANCES, SHE KNEW, MUST BE MADE FOR THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SPOKE.
SHE HEARD IT ALL UNDER EMBELLISHMENT.  ALL THAT SOUNDED EXTRAVAGANT
OR IRRATIONAL IN THE PROGRESS OF THE RECONCILIATION MIGHT HAVE NO ORIGIN
BUT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE RELATORS.  STILL, HOWEVER, SHE HAD
THE SENSATION OF THERE BEING SOMETHING MORE THAN IMMEDIATELY APPEARED,
IN MR ELLIOT'S WISHING, AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SO MANY YEARS,
TO BE WELL RECEIVED BY THEM.  IN A WORLDLY VIEW, HE HAD NOTHING TO GAIN
BY BEING ON TERMS WITH SIR WALTER; NOTHING TO RISK BY A STATE OF VARIANCE.
IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WAS ALREADY THE RICHER OF THE TWO,
AND THE KELLYNCH ESTATE WOULD AS SURELY BE HIS HEREAFTER AS THE TITLE.
A SENSIBLE MAN, AND HE HAD LOOKED LIKE A VERY SENSIBLE MAN,
WHY SHOULD IT BE AN OBJECT TO HIM?  SHE COULD ONLY OFFER ONE SOLUTION;
IT WAS, PERHAPS, FOR ELIZABETH'S SAKE.  THERE MIGHT REALLY HAVE BEEN
A LIKING FORMERLY, THOUGH CONVENIENCE AND ACCIDENT HAD DRAWN HIM
A DIFFERENT WAY; AND NOW THAT HE COULD AFFORD TO PLEASE HIMSELF,
HE MIGHT MEAN TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO HER.  ELIZABETH WAS CERTAINLY
VERY HANDSOME, WITH WELL-BRED, ELEGANT MANNERS, AND HER CHARACTER
MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN PENETRATED BY MR ELLIOT, KNOWING HER BUT IN PUBLIC,
AND WHEN VERY YOUNG HIMSELF.  HOW HER TEMPER AND UNDERSTANDING
MIGHT BEAR THE INVESTIGATION OF HIS PRESENT KEENER TIME OF LIFE
WAS ANOTHER CONCERN AND RATHER A FEARFUL ONE.  MOST EARNESTLY DID SHE WISH
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE TOO NICE, OR TOO OBSERVANT IF ELIZABETH
WERE HIS OBJECT; AND THAT ELIZABETH WAS DISPOSED TO BELIEVE HERSELF SO,
AND THAT HER FRIEND MRS CLAY WAS ENCOURAGING THE IDEA, SEEMED APPARENT
BY A GLANCE OR TWO BETWEEN THEM, WHILE MR ELLIOT'S FREQUENT VISITS
WERE TALKED OF.

ANNE MENTIONED THE GLIMPSES SHE HAD HAD OF HIM AT LYME, BUT WITHOUT
BEING MUCH ATTENDED TO.  "OH! YES, PERHAPS, IT HAD BEEN MR ELLIOT.
THEY DID NOT KNOW.  IT MIGHT BE HIM, PERHAPS."  THEY COULD NOT LISTEN
TO HER DESCRIPTION OF HIM.  THEY WERE DESCRIBING HIM THEMSELVES;
SIR WALTER ESPECIALLY.  HE DID JUSTICE TO HIS VERY GENTLEMANLIKE
APPEARANCE, HIS AIR OF ELEGANCE AND FASHION, HIS GOOD SHAPED FACE,
HIS SENSIBLE EYE; BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, "MUST LAMENT HIS BEING
VERY MUCH UNDER-HUNG, A DEFECT WHICH TIME SEEMED TO HAVE INCREASED;
NOR COULD HE PRETEND TO SAY THAT TEN YEARS HAD NOT ALTERED
ALMOST EVERY FEATURE FOR THE WORSE.  MR ELLIOT APPEARED TO THINK
THAT HE (SIR WALTER) WAS LOOKING EXACTLY AS HE HAD DONE WHEN
THEY LAST PARTED;" BUT SIR WALTER HAD "NOT BEEN ABLE TO RETURN
THE COMPLIMENT ENTIRELY, WHICH HAD EMBARRASSED HIM.  HE DID NOT MEAN
TO COMPLAIN, HOWEVER.  MR ELLIOT WAS BETTER TO LOOK AT THAN MOST MEN,
AND HE HAD NO OBJECTION TO BEING SEEN WITH HIM ANYWHERE."

MR ELLIOT, AND HIS FRIENDS IN MARLBOROUGH BUILDINGS, WERE TALKED OF
THE WHOLE EVENING.  "COLONEL WALLIS HAD BEEN SO IMPATIENT TO BE
INTRODUCED TO THEM! AND MR ELLIOT SO ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD!"
AND THERE WAS A MRS WALLIS, AT PRESENT KNOWN ONLY TO THEM BY DESCRIPTION,
AS SHE WAS IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF HER CONFINEMENT; BUT MR ELLIOT
SPOKE OF HER AS "A MOST CHARMING WOMAN, QUITE WORTHY OF BEING KNOWN
IN CAMDEN PLACE," AND AS SOON AS SHE RECOVERED THEY WERE TO BE ACQUAINTED.
SIR WALTER THOUGHT MUCH OF MRS WALLIS; SHE WAS SAID TO BE
AN EXCESSIVELY PRETTY WOMAN, BEAUTIFUL.  "HE LONGED TO SEE HER.
HE HOPED SHE MIGHT MAKE SOME AMENDS FOR THE MANY VERY PLAIN FACES
HE WAS CONTINUALLY PASSING IN THE STREETS.  THE WORST OF BATH WAS
THE NUMBER OF ITS PLAIN WOMEN.  HE DID NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE WERE
NO PRETTY WOMEN, BUT THE NUMBER OF THE PLAIN WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION.
HE HAD FREQUENTLY OBSERVED, AS HE WALKED, THAT ONE HANDSOME FACE
WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THIRTY, OR FIVE-AND-THIRTY FRIGHTS; AND ONCE,
AS HE HAD STOOD IN A SHOP ON BOND STREET, HE HAD COUNTED
EIGHTY-SEVEN WOMEN GO BY, ONE AFTER ANOTHER, WITHOUT THERE BEING
A TOLERABLE FACE AMONG THEM.  IT HAD BEEN A FROSTY MORNING,
TO BE SURE, A SHARP FROST, WHICH HARDLY ONE WOMAN IN A THOUSAND
COULD STAND THE TEST OF.  BUT STILL, THERE CERTAINLY WERE
A DREADFUL MULTITUDE OF UGLY WOMEN IN BATH; AND AS FOR THE MEN!
THEY WERE INFINITELY WORSE.  SUCH SCARECROWS AS THE STREETS WERE FULL OF!
IT WAS EVIDENT HOW LITTLE THE WOMEN WERE USED TO THE SIGHT OF ANYTHING
TOLERABLE, BY THE EFFECT WHICH A MAN OF DECENT APPEARANCE PRODUCED.
HE HAD NEVER WALKED ANYWHERE ARM-IN-ARM WITH COLONEL WALLIS
(WHO WAS A FINE MILITARY FIGURE, THOUGH SANDY-HAIRED) WITHOUT OBSERVING
THAT EVERY WOMAN'S EYE WAS UPON HIM; EVERY WOMAN'S EYE WAS SURE TO BE
UPON COLONEL WALLIS."  MODEST SIR WALTER!  HE WAS NOT ALLOWED
TO ESCAPE, HOWEVER.  HIS DAUGHTER AND MRS CLAY UNITED IN HINTING
THAT COLONEL WALLIS'S COMPANION MIGHT HAVE AS GOOD A FIGURE
AS COLONEL WALLIS, AND CERTAINLY WAS NOT SANDY-HAIRED.

"HOW IS MARY LOOKING?" SAID SIR WALTER, IN THE HEIGHT OF HIS GOOD HUMOUR.
"THE LAST TIME I SAW HER SHE HAD A RED NOSE, BUT I HOPE THAT MAY NOT
HAPPEN EVERY DAY."

"OH! NO, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCIDENTAL.  IN GENERAL SHE HAS BEEN
IN VERY GOOD HEALTH AND VERY GOOD LOOKS SINCE MICHAELMAS."

"IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT TEMPT HER TO GO OUT IN SHARP WINDS,
AND GROW COARSE, I WOULD SEND HER A NEW HAT AND PELISSE."

ANNE WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER SHE SHOULD VENTURE TO SUGGEST THAT A GOWN,
OR A CAP, WOULD NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY SUCH MISUSE, WHEN A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
SUSPENDED EVERYTHING.  "A KNOCK AT THE DOOR! AND SO LATE!
IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK.  COULD IT BE MR ELLIOT?  THEY KNEW HE WAS TO DINE
IN LANSDOWN CRESCENT.  IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT STOP IN HIS WAY HOME
TO ASK THEM HOW THEY DID.  THEY COULD THINK OF NO ONE ELSE.
MRS CLAY DECIDEDLY THOUGHT IT MR ELLIOT'S KNOCK."  MRS CLAY WAS RIGHT.
WITH ALL THE STATE WHICH A BUTLER AND FOOT-BOY COULD GIVE,
MR ELLIOT WAS USHERED INTO THE ROOM.

IT WAS THE SAME, THE VERY SAME MAN, WITH NO DIFFERENCE BUT OF DRESS.
ANNE DREW A LITTLE BACK, WHILE THE OTHERS RECEIVED HIS COMPLIMENTS,
AND HER SISTER HIS APOLOGIES FOR CALLING AT SO UNUSUAL AN HOUR,
BUT "HE COULD NOT BE SO NEAR WITHOUT WISHING TO KNOW THAT NEITHER SHE
NOR HER FRIEND HAD TAKEN COLD THE DAY BEFORE," &C. &C; WHICH WAS
ALL AS POLITELY DONE, AND AS POLITELY TAKEN, AS POSSIBLE, BUT HER PART
MUST FOLLOW THEN.  SIR WALTER TALKED OF HIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER;
"MR ELLIOT MUST GIVE HIM LEAVE TO PRESENT HIM TO HIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER"
(THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR REMEMBERING MARY); AND ANNE, SMILING AND
BLUSHING, VERY BECOMINGLY SHEWED TO MR ELLIOT THE PRETTY FEATURES
WHICH HE HAD BY NO MEANS FORGOTTEN, AND INSTANTLY SAW, WITH AMUSEMENT
AT HIS LITTLE START OF SURPRISE, THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN AT ALL AWARE
OF WHO SHE WAS.  HE LOOKED COMPLETELY ASTONISHED, BUT NOT MORE ASTONISHED
THAN PLEASED; HIS EYES BRIGHTENED! AND WITH THE MOST PERFECT ALACRITY
HE WELCOMED THE RELATIONSHIP, ALLUDED TO THE PAST, AND ENTREATED
TO BE RECEIVED AS AN ACQUAINTANCE ALREADY.  HE WAS QUITE AS GOOD-LOOKING
AS HE HAD APPEARED AT LYME, HIS COUNTENANCE IMPROVED BY SPEAKING,
AND HIS MANNERS WERE SO EXACTLY WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE, SO POLISHED,
SO EASY, SO PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE, THAT SHE COULD COMPARE THEM
IN EXCELLENCE TO ONLY ONE PERSON'S MANNERS.  THEY WERE NOT THE SAME,
BUT THEY WERE, PERHAPS, EQUALLY GOOD.

HE SAT DOWN WITH THEM, AND IMPROVED THEIR CONVERSATION VERY MUCH.
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING A SENSIBLE MAN.  TEN MINUTES
WERE ENOUGH TO CERTIFY THAT.  HIS TONE, HIS EXPRESSIONS,
HIS CHOICE OF SUBJECT, HIS KNOWING WHERE TO STOP; IT WAS ALL
THE OPERATION OF A SENSIBLE, DISCERNING MIND.  AS SOON AS HE COULD,
HE BEGAN TO TALK TO HER OF LYME, WANTING TO COMPARE OPINIONS
RESPECTING THE PLACE, BUT ESPECIALLY WANTING TO SPEAK OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE
OF THEIR HAPPENING TO BE GUESTS IN THE SAME INN AT THE SAME TIME;
TO GIVE HIS OWN ROUTE, UNDERSTAND SOMETHING OF HERS, AND REGRET THAT
HE SHOULD HAVE LOST SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO HER.
SHE GAVE HIM A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HER PARTY AND BUSINESS AT LYME.
HIS REGRET INCREASED AS HE LISTENED.  HE HAD SPENT HIS WHOLE
SOLITARY EVENING IN THE ROOM ADJOINING THEIRS; HAD HEARD VOICES,
MIRTH CONTINUALLY; THOUGHT THEY MUST BE A MOST DELIGHTFUL SET OF PEOPLE,
LONGED TO BE WITH THEM, BUT CERTAINLY WITHOUT THE SMALLEST SUSPICION
OF HIS POSSESSING THE SHADOW OF A RIGHT TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF.
IF HE HAD BUT ASKED WHO THE PARTY WERE!  THE NAME OF MUSGROVE WOULD
HAVE TOLD HIM ENOUGH.  "WELL, IT WOULD SERVE TO CURE HIM OF
AN ABSURD PRACTICE OF NEVER ASKING A QUESTION AT AN INN,
WHICH HE HAD ADOPTED, WHEN QUITE A YOUNG MAN, ON THE PRINCIPAL
OF ITS BEING VERY UNGENTEEL TO BE CURIOUS.

"THE NOTIONS OF A YOUNG MAN OF ONE OR TWO AND TWENTY," SAID HE,
"AS TO WHAT IS NECESSARY IN MANNERS TO MAKE HIM QUITE THE THING,
ARE MORE ABSURD, I BELIEVE, THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER SET OF BEINGS
IN THE WORLD.  THE FOLLY OF THE MEANS THEY OFTEN EMPLOY
IS ONLY TO BE EQUALLED BY THE FOLLY OF WHAT THEY HAVE IN VIEW."

BUT HE MUST NOT BE ADDRESSING HIS REFLECTIONS TO ANNE ALONE:
HE KNEW IT; HE WAS SOON DIFFUSED AGAIN AMONG THE OTHERS,
AND IT WAS ONLY AT INTERVALS THAT HE COULD RETURN TO LYME.

HIS ENQUIRIES, HOWEVER, PRODUCED AT LENGTH AN ACCOUNT OF THE SCENE
SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THERE, SOON AFTER HIS LEAVING THE PLACE.
HAVING ALLUDED TO "AN ACCIDENT,"  HE MUST HEAR THE WHOLE.
WHEN HE QUESTIONED, SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH BEGAN TO QUESTION ALSO,
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR MANNER OF DOING IT COULD NOT BE UNFELT.
SHE COULD ONLY COMPARE MR ELLIOT TO LADY RUSSELL, IN THE WISH
OF REALLY COMPREHENDING WHAT HAD PASSED, AND IN THE DEGREE OF CONCERN
FOR WHAT SHE MUST HAVE SUFFERED IN WITNESSING IT.

HE STAID AN HOUR WITH THEM.  THE ELEGANT LITTLE CLOCK ON THE MANTEL-
PIECE HAD STRUCK "ELEVEN WITH ITS SILVER SOUNDS," AND THE WATCHMAN
WAS BEGINNING TO BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE TELLING THE SAME TALE,
BEFORE MR ELLIOT OR ANY OF THEM SEEMED TO FEEL THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE LONG.

ANNE COULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE THAT HER FIRST EVENING IN
CAMDEN PLACE COULD HAVE PASSED SO WELL!



CHAPTER 16


THERE WAS ONE POINT WHICH ANNE, ON RETURNING TO HER FAMILY,
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THANKFUL TO ASCERTAIN EVEN THAN MR ELLIOT'S
BEING IN LOVE WITH ELIZABETH, WHICH WAS, HER FATHER'S NOT BEING
IN LOVE WITH MRS CLAY; AND SHE WAS VERY FAR FROM EASY ABOUT IT,
WHEN SHE HAD BEEN AT HOME A FEW HOURS.  ON GOING DOWN TO BREAKFAST
THE NEXT MORNING, SHE FOUND THERE HAD JUST BEEN A DECENT PRETENCE
ON THE LADY'S SIDE OF MEANING TO LEAVE THEM.  SHE COULD IMAGINE MRS CLAY
TO HAVE SAID, THAT "NOW MISS ANNE WAS COME, SHE COULD NOT SUPPOSE HERSELF
AT ALL WANTED;" FOR ELIZABETH WAS REPLYING IN A SORT OF WHISPER,
"THAT MUST NOT BE ANY REASON, INDEED.  I ASSURE YOU I FEEL IT NONE.
SHE IS NOTHING TO ME, COMPARED WITH YOU;"  AND SHE WAS IN FULL TIME
TO HEAR HER FATHER SAY, "MY DEAR MADAM, THIS MUST NOT BE.  AS YET,
YOU HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF BATH.  YOU HAVE BEEN HERE ONLY TO BE USEFUL.
YOU MUST NOT RUN AWAY FROM US NOW.  YOU MUST STAY TO BE ACQUAINTED
WITH MRS WALLIS, THE BEAUTIFUL MRS WALLIS.  TO YOUR FINE MIND,
I WELL KNOW THE SIGHT OF BEAUTY IS A REAL GRATIFICATION."

HE SPOKE AND LOOKED SO MUCH IN EARNEST, THAT ANNE WAS NOT SURPRISED
TO SEE MRS CLAY STEALING A GLANCE AT ELIZABETH AND HERSELF.
HER COUNTENANCE, PERHAPS, MIGHT EXPRESS SOME WATCHFULNESS;
BUT THE PRAISE OF THE FINE MIND DID NOT APPEAR TO EXCITE A THOUGHT
IN HER SISTER.  THE LADY COULD NOT BUT YIELD TO SUCH JOINT ENTREATIES,
AND PROMISE TO STAY.

IN THE COURSE OF THE SAME MORNING, ANNE AND HER FATHER CHANCING TO BE
ALONE TOGETHER, HE BEGAN TO COMPLIMENT HER ON HER IMPROVED LOOKS;
HE THOUGHT HER "LESS THIN IN HER PERSON, IN HER CHEEKS; HER SKIN,
HER COMPLEXION, GREATLY IMPROVED; CLEARER, FRESHER.  HAD SHE BEEN
USING ANY THING IN PARTICULAR?"  "NO, NOTHING."  "MERELY GOWLAND,"
HE SUPPOSED.  "NO, NOTHING AT ALL."  "HA! HE WAS SURPRISED AT THAT;"
AND ADDED, "CERTAINLY YOU CANNOT DO BETTER THAN TO CONTINUE AS YOU ARE;
YOU CANNOT BE BETTER THAN WELL; OR I SHOULD RECOMMEND GOWLAND,
THE CONSTANT USE OF GOWLAND, DURING THE SPRING MONTHS.  MRS CLAY HAS BEEN
USING IT AT MY RECOMMENDATION, AND YOU SEE WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR HER.
YOU SEE HOW IT HAS CARRIED AWAY HER FRECKLES."

IF ELIZABETH COULD BUT HAVE HEARD THIS!  SUCH PERSONAL PRAISE
MIGHT HAVE STRUCK HER, ESPECIALLY AS IT DID NOT APPEAR TO ANNE
THAT THE FRECKLES WERE AT ALL LESSENED.  BUT EVERYTHING MUST
TAKE ITS CHANCE.  THE EVIL OF A MARRIAGE WOULD BE MUCH DIMINISHED,
IF ELIZABETH WERE ALSO TO MARRY.  AS FOR HERSELF, SHE MIGHT ALWAYS
COMMAND A HOME WITH LADY RUSSELL.

LADY RUSSELL'S COMPOSED MIND AND POLITE MANNERS WERE PUT TO SOME TRIAL
ON THIS POINT, IN HER INTERCOURSE IN CAMDEN PLACE.  THE SIGHT OF MRS CLAY
IN SUCH FAVOUR, AND OF ANNE SO OVERLOOKED, WAS A PERPETUAL PROVOCATION
TO HER THERE; AND VEXED HER AS MUCH WHEN SHE WAS AWAY, AS A PERSON IN BATH
WHO DRINKS THE WATER, GETS ALL THE NEW PUBLICATIONS, AND HAS
A VERY LARGE ACQUAINTANCE, HAS TIME TO BE VEXED.

AS MR ELLIOT BECAME KNOWN TO HER, SHE GREW MORE CHARITABLE,
OR MORE INDIFFERENT, TOWARDS THE OTHERS.  HIS MANNERS WERE
AN IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATION; AND ON CONVERSING WITH HIM SHE FOUND
THE SOLID SO FULLY SUPPORTING THE SUPERFICIAL, THAT SHE WAS AT FIRST,
AS SHE TOLD ANNE, ALMOST READY TO EXCLAIM, "CAN THIS BE MR ELLIOT?"
AND COULD NOT SERIOUSLY PICTURE TO HERSELF A MORE AGREEABLE
OR ESTIMABLE MAN.  EVERYTHING UNITED IN HIM; GOOD UNDERSTANDING,
CORRECT OPINIONS, KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD, AND A WARM HEART.
HE HAD STRONG FEELINGS OF FAMILY ATTACHMENT AND FAMILY HONOUR,
WITHOUT PRIDE OR WEAKNESS; HE LIVED WITH THE LIBERALITY OF A MAN OF FORTUNE,
WITHOUT DISPLAY; HE JUDGED FOR HIMSELF IN EVERYTHING ESSENTIAL,
WITHOUT DEFYING PUBLIC OPINION IN ANY POINT OF WORLDLY DECORUM.
HE WAS STEADY, OBSERVANT, MODERATE, CANDID; NEVER RUN AWAY WITH BY SPIRITS
OR BY SELFISHNESS, WHICH FANCIED ITSELF STRONG FEELING; AND YET,
WITH A SENSIBILITY TO WHAT WAS AMIABLE AND LOVELY, AND A VALUE
FOR ALL THE FELICITIES OF DOMESTIC LIFE, WHICH CHARACTERS OF
FANCIED ENTHUSIASM AND VIOLENT AGITATION SELDOM REALLY POSSESS.
SHE WAS SURE THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN HAPPY IN MARRIAGE.  COLONEL WALLIS
SAID IT, AND LADY RUSSELL SAW IT; BUT IT HAD BEEN NO UNHAPPINESS
TO SOUR HIS MIND, NOR (SHE BEGAN PRETTY SOON TO SUSPECT) TO PREVENT HIS
THINKING OF A SECOND CHOICE.  HER SATISFACTION IN MR ELLIOT
OUTWEIGHED ALL THE PLAGUE OF MRS CLAY.

IT WAS NOW SOME YEARS SINCE ANNE HAD BEGUN TO LEARN THAT SHE
AND HER EXCELLENT FRIEND COULD SOMETIMES THINK DIFFERENTLY;
AND IT DID NOT SURPRISE HER, THEREFORE, THAT LADY RUSSELL
SHOULD SEE NOTHING SUSPICIOUS OR INCONSISTENT, NOTHING TO REQUIRE
MORE MOTIVES THAN APPEARED, IN MR ELLIOT'S GREAT DESIRE OF A RECONCILIATION.
IN LADY RUSSELL'S VIEW, IT WAS PERFECTLY NATURAL THAT MR ELLIOT,
AT A MATURE TIME OF LIFE, SHOULD FEEL IT A MOST DESIRABLE OBJECT,
AND WHAT WOULD VERY GENERALLY RECOMMEND HIM AMONG ALL SENSIBLE PEOPLE,
TO BE ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE HEAD OF HIS FAMILY; THE SIMPLEST PROCESS
IN THE WORLD OF TIME UPON A HEAD NATURALLY CLEAR, AND ONLY ERRING
IN THE HEYDAY OF YOUTH.  ANNE PRESUMED, HOWEVER, STILL TO SMILE ABOUT IT,
AND AT LAST TO MENTION "ELIZABETH."  LADY RUSSELL LISTENED, AND LOOKED,
AND MADE ONLY THIS CAUTIOUS REPLY:--"ELIZABETH! VERY WELL;
TIME WILL EXPLAIN."

IT WAS A REFERENCE TO THE FUTURE, WHICH ANNE, AFTER A LITTLE OBSERVATION,
FELT SHE MUST SUBMIT TO.  SHE COULD DETERMINE NOTHING AT PRESENT.
IN THAT HOUSE ELIZABETH MUST BE FIRST; AND SHE WAS IN THE HABIT
OF SUCH GENERAL OBSERVANCE AS "MISS ELLIOT," THAT ANY PARTICULARITY
OF ATTENTION SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  MR ELLIOT, TOO,
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED, HAD NOT BEEN A WIDOWER SEVEN MONTHS.
A LITTLE DELAY ON HIS SIDE MIGHT BE VERY EXCUSABLE.  IN FACT,
ANNE COULD NEVER SEE THE CRAPE ROUND HIS HAT, WITHOUT FEARING THAT
SHE WAS THE INEXCUSABLE ONE, IN ATTRIBUTING TO HIM SUCH IMAGINATIONS;
FOR THOUGH HIS MARRIAGE HAD NOT BEEN VERY HAPPY, STILL IT HAD EXISTED
SO MANY YEARS THAT SHE COULD NOT COMPREHEND A VERY RAPID RECOVERY
FROM THE AWFUL IMPRESSION OF ITS BEING DISSOLVED.

HOWEVER IT MIGHT END, HE WAS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THEIR
PLEASANTEST ACQUAINTANCE IN BATH:  SHE SAW NOBODY EQUAL TO HIM;
AND IT WAS A GREAT INDULGENCE NOW AND THEN TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT LYME,
WHICH HE SEEMED TO HAVE AS LIVELY A WISH TO SEE AGAIN, AND TO SEE MORE OF,
AS HERSELF.  THEY WENT THROUGH THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR FIRST MEETING
A GREAT MANY TIMES.  HE GAVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD
LOOKED AT HER WITH SOME EARNESTNESS.  SHE KNEW IT WELL;
AND SHE REMEMBERED ANOTHER PERSON'S LOOK ALSO.

THEY DID NOT ALWAYS THINK ALIKE.  HIS VALUE FOR RANK AND CONNEXION
SHE PERCEIVED WAS GREATER THAN HERS.  IT WAS NOT MERELY COMPLAISANCE,
IT MUST BE A LIKING TO THE CAUSE, WHICH MADE HIM ENTER WARMLY
INTO HER FATHER AND SISTER'S SOLICITUDES ON A SUBJECT WHICH
SHE THOUGHT UNWORTHY TO EXCITE THEM.  THE BATH PAPER ONE MORNING
ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS DALRYMPLE,
AND HER DAUGHTER, THE HONOURABLE MISS CARTERET; AND ALL THE COMFORT
OF NO.--, CAMDEN PLACE, WAS SWEPT AWAY FOR MANY DAYS; FOR THE DALRYMPLES
(IN ANNE'S OPINION, MOST UNFORTUNATELY) WERE COUSINS OF THE ELLIOTS;
AND THE AGONY WAS HOW TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES PROPERLY.

ANNE HAD NEVER SEEN HER FATHER AND SISTER BEFORE IN CONTACT WITH NOBILITY,
AND SHE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE HERSELF DISAPPOINTED.  SHE HAD HOPED
BETTER THINGS FROM THEIR HIGH IDEAS OF THEIR OWN SITUATION IN LIFE,
AND WAS REDUCED TO FORM A WISH WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FORESEEN;
A WISH THAT THEY HAD MORE PRIDE; FOR "OUR COUSINS LADY DALRYMPLE
AND MISS CARTERET;" "OUR COUSINS, THE DALRYMPLES," SOUNDED IN HER EARS
ALL DAY LONG.

SIR WALTER HAD ONCE BEEN IN COMPANY WITH THE LATE VISCOUNT,
BUT HAD NEVER SEEN ANY OF THE REST OF THE FAMILY; AND THE DIFFICULTIES
OF THE CASE AROSE FROM THERE HAVING BEEN A SUSPENSION OF ALL INTERCOURSE
BY LETTERS OF CEREMONY, EVER SINCE THE DEATH OF THAT SAID LATE VISCOUNT,
WHEN, IN CONSEQUENCE OF A DANGEROUS ILLNESS OF SIR WALTER'S
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAD BEEN AN UNLUCKY OMISSION AT KELLYNCH.
NO LETTER OF CONDOLENCE HAD BEEN SENT TO IRELAND.  THE NEGLECT
HAD BEEN VISITED ON THE HEAD OF THE SINNER; FOR WHEN POOR LADY ELLIOT
DIED HERSELF, NO LETTER OF CONDOLENCE WAS RECEIVED AT KELLYNCH,
AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THERE WAS BUT TOO MUCH REASON TO APPREHEND
THAT THE DALRYMPLES CONSIDERED THE RELATIONSHIP AS CLOSED.
HOW TO HAVE THIS ANXIOUS BUSINESS SET TO RIGHTS, AND BE ADMITTED
AS COUSINS AGAIN, WAS THE QUESTION:  AND IT WAS A QUESTION WHICH,
IN A MORE RATIONAL MANNER, NEITHER LADY RUSSELL NOR MR ELLIOT
THOUGHT UNIMPORTANT.  "FAMILY CONNEXIONS WERE ALWAYS WORTH PRESERVING,
GOOD COMPANY ALWAYS WORTH SEEKING; LADY DALRYMPLE HAD TAKEN A HOUSE,
FOR THREE MONTHS, IN LAURA PLACE, AND WOULD BE LIVING IN STYLE.
SHE HAD BEEN AT BATH THE YEAR BEFORE, AND LADY RUSSELL HAD HEARD HER
SPOKEN OF AS A CHARMING WOMAN.  IT WAS VERY DESIRABLE THAT
THE CONNEXION SHOULD BE RENEWED, IF IT COULD BE DONE, WITHOUT ANY
COMPROMISE OF PROPRIETY ON THE SIDE OF THE ELLIOTS."

SIR WALTER, HOWEVER, WOULD CHOOSE HIS OWN MEANS, AND AT LAST WROTE
A VERY FINE LETTER OF AMPLE EXPLANATION, REGRET, AND ENTREATY,
TO HIS RIGHT HONOURABLE COUSIN.  NEITHER LADY RUSSELL NOR MR ELLIOT
COULD ADMIRE THE LETTER; BUT IT DID ALL THAT WAS WANTED,
IN BRINGING THREE LINES OF SCRAWL FROM THE DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS.
"SHE WAS VERY MUCH HONOURED, AND SHOULD BE HAPPY IN THEIR ACQUAINTANCE."
THE TOILS OF THE BUSINESS WERE OVER, THE SWEETS BEGAN.  THEY VISITED
IN LAURA PLACE, THEY HAD THE CARDS OF DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS DALRYMPLE,
AND THE HONOURABLE MISS CARTERET, TO BE ARRANGED WHEREVER THEY MIGHT
BE MOST VISIBLE:  AND "OUR COUSINS IN LAURA PLACE,"--"OUR COUSIN,
LADY DALRYMPLE AND MISS CARTERET," WERE TALKED OF TO EVERYBODY.

ANNE WAS ASHAMED.  HAD LADY DALRYMPLE AND HER DAUGHTER EVEN BEEN
VERY AGREEABLE, SHE WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF THE AGITATION
THEY CREATED, BUT THEY WERE NOTHING.  THERE WAS NO SUPERIORITY OF MANNER,
ACCOMPLISHMENT, OR UNDERSTANDING.  LADY DALRYMPLE HAD ACQUIRED
THE NAME OF "A CHARMING WOMAN," BECAUSE SHE HAD A SMILE AND A CIVIL ANSWER
FOR EVERYBODY.  MISS CARTERET, WITH STILL LESS TO SAY, WAS SO PLAIN
AND SO AWKWARD, THAT SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN TOLERATED IN CAMDEN PLACE
BUT FOR HER BIRTH.

LADY RUSSELL CONFESSED SHE HAD EXPECTED SOMETHING BETTER; BUT YET
"IT WAS AN ACQUAINTANCE WORTH HAVING;" AND WHEN ANNE VENTURED TO SPEAK
HER OPINION OF THEM TO MR ELLIOT, HE AGREED TO THEIR BEING NOTHING
IN THEMSELVES, BUT STILL MAINTAINED THAT, AS A FAMILY CONNEXION,
AS GOOD COMPANY, AS THOSE WHO WOULD COLLECT GOOD COMPANY AROUND THEM,
THEY HAD THEIR VALUE.  ANNE SMILED AND SAID,

"MY IDEA OF GOOD COMPANY, MR ELLIOT, IS THE COMPANY OF CLEVER,
WELL-INFORMED PEOPLE, WHO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONVERSATION;
THAT IS WHAT I CALL GOOD COMPANY."

"YOU ARE MISTAKEN," SAID HE GENTLY, "THAT IS NOT GOOD COMPANY;
THAT IS THE BEST.  GOOD COMPANY REQUIRES ONLY BIRTH, EDUCATION,
AND MANNERS, AND WITH REGARD TO EDUCATION IS NOT VERY NICE.
BIRTH AND GOOD MANNERS ARE ESSENTIAL; BUT A LITTLE LEARNING IS
BY NO MEANS A DANGEROUS THING IN GOOD COMPANY; ON THE CONTRARY,
IT WILL DO VERY WELL.  MY COUSIN ANNE SHAKES HER HEAD.
SHE IS NOT SATISFIED.  SHE IS FASTIDIOUS.  MY DEAR COUSIN"
(SITTING DOWN BY HER), "YOU HAVE A BETTER RIGHT TO BE FASTIDIOUS
THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER WOMAN I KNOW; BUT WILL IT ANSWER?
WILL IT MAKE YOU HAPPY?  WILL IT NOT BE WISER TO ACCEPT THE SOCIETY
OF THOSE GOOD LADIES IN LAURA PLACE, AND ENJOY ALL THE ADVANTAGES
OF THE CONNEXION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE?  YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT,
THAT THEY WILL MOVE IN THE FIRST SET IN BATH THIS WINTER,
AND AS RANK IS RANK, YOUR BEING KNOWN TO BE RELATED TO THEM
WILL HAVE ITS USE IN FIXING YOUR FAMILY (OUR FAMILY LET ME SAY)
IN THAT DEGREE OF CONSIDERATION WHICH WE MUST ALL WISH FOR."

"YES," SIGHED ANNE, "WE SHALL, INDEED, BE KNOWN TO BE RELATED TO THEM!"
THEN RECOLLECTING HERSELF, AND NOT WISHING TO BE ANSWERED, SHE ADDED,
"I CERTAINLY DO THINK THERE HAS BEEN BY FAR TOO MUCH TROUBLE TAKEN
TO PROCURE THE ACQUAINTANCE.  I SUPPOSE" (SMILING) "I HAVE MORE PRIDE
THAN ANY OF YOU; BUT I CONFESS IT DOES VEX ME, THAT WE SHOULD BE
SO SOLICITOUS TO HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP ACKNOWLEDGED, WHICH WE MAY
BE VERY SURE IS A MATTER OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE TO THEM."

"PARDON ME, DEAR COUSIN, YOU ARE UNJUST IN YOUR OWN CLAIMS.
IN LONDON, PERHAPS, IN YOUR PRESENT QUIET STYLE OF LIVING,
IT MIGHT BE AS YOU SAY:  BUT IN BATH; SIR WALTER ELLIOT AND HIS FAMILY
WILL ALWAYS BE WORTH KNOWING:  ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE AS ACQUAINTANCE."

"WELL," SAID ANNE, "I CERTAINLY AM PROUD, TOO PROUD TO ENJOY A WELCOME
WHICH DEPENDS SO ENTIRELY UPON PLACE."

"I LOVE YOUR INDIGNATION," SAID HE; "IT IS VERY NATURAL.
BUT HERE YOU ARE IN BATH, AND THE OBJECT IS TO BE ESTABLISHED HERE
WITH ALL THE CREDIT AND DIGNITY WHICH OUGHT TO BELONG TO SIR WALTER ELLIOT.
YOU TALK OF BEING PROUD; I AM CALLED PROUD, I KNOW, AND I SHALL NOT WISH
TO BELIEVE MYSELF OTHERWISE; FOR OUR PRIDE, IF INVESTIGATED,
WOULD HAVE THE SAME OBJECT, I HAVE NO DOUBT, THOUGH THE KIND MAY SEEM
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.  IN ONE POINT, I AM SURE, MY DEAR COUSIN,"
(HE CONTINUED, SPEAKING LOWER, THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM)
"IN ONE POINT, I AM SURE, WE MUST FEEL ALIKE.  WE MUST FEEL THAT
EVERY ADDITION TO YOUR FATHER'S SOCIETY, AMONG HIS EQUALS OR SUPERIORS,
MAY BE OF USE IN DIVERTING HIS THOUGHTS FROM THOSE WHO ARE BENEATH HIM."

HE LOOKED, AS HE SPOKE, TO THE SEAT WHICH MRS CLAY HAD BEEN
LATELY OCCUPYING:  A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION OF WHAT HE PARTICULARLY MEANT;
AND THOUGH ANNE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN THEIR HAVING THE SAME SORT OF PRIDE,
SHE WAS PLEASED WITH HIM FOR NOT LIKING MRS CLAY; AND HER CONSCIENCE
ADMITTED THAT HIS WISHING TO PROMOTE HER FATHER'S GETTING
GREAT ACQUAINTANCE WAS MORE THAN EXCUSABLE IN THE VIEW OF DEFEATING HER.



CHAPTER 17


WHILE SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE ASSIDUOUSLY PUSHING THEIR
GOOD FORTUNE IN LAURA PLACE, ANNE WAS RENEWING AN ACQUAINTANCE
OF A VERY DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION.

SHE HAD CALLED ON HER FORMER GOVERNESS, AND HAD HEARD FROM HER
OF THERE BEING AN OLD SCHOOL-FELLOW IN BATH, WHO HAD THE TWO STRONG CLAIMS
ON HER ATTENTION OF PAST KINDNESS AND PRESENT SUFFERING.  MISS HAMILTON,
NOW MRS SMITH, HAD SHEWN HER KINDNESS IN ONE OF THOSE PERIODS OF HER LIFE
WHEN IT HAD BEEN MOST VALUABLE.  ANNE HAD GONE UNHAPPY TO SCHOOL,
GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF A MOTHER WHOM SHE HAD DEARLY LOVED,
FEELING HER SEPARATION FROM HOME, AND SUFFERING AS A GIRL OF FOURTEEN,
OF STRONG SENSIBILITY AND NOT HIGH SPIRITS, MUST SUFFER AT SUCH A TIME;
AND MISS HAMILTON, THREE YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF, BUT STILL FROM THE WANT
OF NEAR RELATIONS AND A SETTLED HOME, REMAINING ANOTHER YEAR AT SCHOOL,
HAD BEEN USEFUL AND GOOD TO HER IN A WAY WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY LESSENED
HER MISERY, AND COULD NEVER BE REMEMBERED WITH INDIFFERENCE.

MISS HAMILTON HAD LEFT SCHOOL, HAD MARRIED NOT LONG AFTERWARDS,
WAS SAID TO HAVE MARRIED A MAN OF FORTUNE, AND THIS WAS ALL
THAT ANNE HAD KNOWN OF HER, TILL NOW THAT THEIR GOVERNESS'S ACCOUNT
BROUGHT HER SITUATION FORWARD IN A MORE DECIDED BUT VERY DIFFERENT FORM.

SHE WAS A WIDOW AND POOR.  HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN EXTRAVAGANT;
AND AT HIS DEATH, ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE, HAD LEFT HIS AFFAIRS
DREADFULLY INVOLVED.  SHE HAD HAD DIFFICULTIES OF EVERY SORT
TO CONTEND WITH, AND IN ADDITION TO THESE DISTRESSES HAD BEEN AFFLICTED
WITH A SEVERE RHEUMATIC FEVER, WHICH, FINALLY SETTLING IN HER LEGS,
HAD MADE HER FOR THE PRESENT A CRIPPLE.  SHE HAD COME TO BATH
ON THAT ACCOUNT, AND WAS NOW IN LODGINGS NEAR THE HOT BATHS,
LIVING IN A VERY HUMBLE WAY, UNABLE EVEN TO AFFORD HERSELF
THE COMFORT OF A SERVANT, AND OF COURSE ALMOST EXCLUDED FROM SOCIETY.

THEIR MUTUAL FRIEND ANSWERED FOR THE SATISFACTION WHICH A VISIT
FROM MISS ELLIOT WOULD GIVE MRS SMITH, AND ANNE THEREFORE
LOST NO TIME IN GOING.  SHE MENTIONED NOTHING OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD,
OR WHAT SHE INTENDED, AT HOME.  IT WOULD EXCITE NO PROPER INTEREST THERE.
SHE ONLY CONSULTED LADY RUSSELL, WHO ENTERED THOROUGHLY INTO HER SENTIMENTS,
AND WAS MOST HAPPY TO CONVEY HER AS NEAR TO MRS SMITH'S LODGINGS
IN WESTGATE BUILDINGS, AS ANNE CHOSE TO BE TAKEN.

THE VISIT WAS PAID, THEIR ACQUAINTANCE RE-ESTABLISHED, THEIR INTEREST
IN EACH OTHER MORE THAN RE-KINDLED.  THE FIRST TEN MINUTES
HAD ITS AWKWARDNESS AND ITS EMOTION.  TWELVE YEARS WERE GONE
SINCE THEY HAD PARTED, AND EACH PRESENTED A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT PERSON
FROM WHAT THE OTHER HAD IMAGINED.  TWELVE YEARS HAD CHANGED ANNE
FROM THE BLOOMING, SILENT, UNFORMED GIRL OF FIFTEEN, TO THE ELEGANT
LITTLE WOMAN OF SEVEN-AND-TWENTY, WITH EVERY BEAUTY EXCEPT BLOOM,
AND WITH MANNERS AS CONSCIOUSLY RIGHT AS THEY WERE INVARIABLY GENTLE;
AND TWELVE YEARS HAD TRANSFORMED THE FINE-LOOKING, WELL-GROWN MISS HAMILTON,
IN ALL THE GLOW OF HEALTH AND CONFIDENCE OF SUPERIORITY, INTO A POOR,
INFIRM, HELPLESS WIDOW, RECEIVING THE VISIT OF HER FORMER PROTEGEE
AS A FAVOUR; BUT ALL THAT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE MEETING HAD SOON
PASSED AWAY, AND LEFT ONLY THE INTERESTING CHARM OF REMEMBERING
FORMER PARTIALITIES AND TALKING OVER OLD TIMES.

ANNE FOUND IN MRS SMITH THE GOOD SENSE AND AGREEABLE MANNERS WHICH
SHE HAD ALMOST VENTURED TO DEPEND ON, AND A DISPOSITION TO CONVERSE
AND BE CHEERFUL BEYOND HER EXPECTATION.  NEITHER THE DISSIPATIONS
OF THE PAST--AND SHE HAD LIVED VERY MUCH IN THE WORLD--NOR THE RESTRICTIONS
OF THE PRESENT, NEITHER SICKNESS NOR SORROW SEEMED TO HAVE
CLOSED HER HEART OR RUINED HER SPIRITS.

IN THE COURSE OF A SECOND VISIT SHE TALKED WITH GREAT OPENNESS,
AND ANNE'S ASTONISHMENT INCREASED.  SHE COULD SCARCELY IMAGINE
A MORE CHEERLESS SITUATION IN ITSELF THAN MRS SMITH'S.  SHE HAD BEEN
VERY FOND OF HER HUSBAND:  SHE HAD BURIED HIM.  SHE HAD BEEN
USED TO AFFLUENCE:  IT WAS GONE.  SHE HAD NO CHILD TO CONNECT HER
WITH LIFE AND HAPPINESS AGAIN, NO RELATIONS TO ASSIST IN THE ARRANGEMENT
OF PERPLEXED AFFAIRS, NO HEALTH TO MAKE ALL THE REST SUPPORTABLE.
HER ACCOMMODATIONS WERE LIMITED TO A NOISY PARLOUR, AND A DARK BEDROOM
BEHIND, WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF MOVING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WITHOUT
ASSISTANCE, WHICH THERE WAS ONLY ONE SERVANT IN THE HOUSE TO AFFORD,
AND SHE NEVER QUITTED THE HOUSE BUT TO BE CONVEYED INTO THE WARM BATH.
YET, IN SPITE OF ALL THIS, ANNE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD
MOMENTS ONLY OF LANGUOR AND DEPRESSION, TO HOURS OF OCCUPATION
AND ENJOYMENT.  HOW COULD IT BE?  SHE WATCHED, OBSERVED, REFLECTED,
AND FINALLY DETERMINED THAT THIS WAS NOT A CASE OF FORTITUDE
OR OF RESIGNATION ONLY.  A SUBMISSIVE SPIRIT MIGHT BE PATIENT,
A STRONG UNDERSTANDING WOULD SUPPLY RESOLUTION, BUT HERE WAS SOMETHING MORE;
HERE WAS THAT ELASTICITY OF MIND, THAT DISPOSITION TO BE COMFORTED,
THAT POWER OF TURNING READILY FROM EVIL TO GOOD, AND OF FINDING EMPLOYMENT
WHICH CARRIED HER OUT OF HERSELF, WHICH WAS FROM NATURE ALONE.
IT WAS THE CHOICEST GIFT OF HEAVEN; AND ANNE VIEWED HER FRIEND
AS ONE OF THOSE INSTANCES IN WHICH, BY A MERCIFUL APPOINTMENT,
IT SEEMS DESIGNED TO COUNTERBALANCE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WANT.

THERE HAD BEEN A TIME, MRS SMITH TOLD HER, WHEN HER SPIRITS
HAD NEARLY FAILED.  SHE COULD NOT CALL HERSELF AN INVALID NOW,
COMPARED WITH HER STATE ON FIRST REACHING BATH.  THEN SHE HAD, INDEED,
BEEN A PITIABLE OBJECT; FOR SHE HAD CAUGHT COLD ON THE JOURNEY,
AND HAD HARDLY TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER LODGINGS BEFORE SHE WAS AGAIN
CONFINED TO HER BED AND SUFFERING UNDER SEVERE AND CONSTANT PAIN;
AND ALL THIS AMONG STRANGERS, WITH THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF HAVING
A REGULAR NURSE, AND FINANCES AT THAT MOMENT PARTICULARLY UNFIT
TO MEET ANY EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSE.  SHE HAD WEATHERED IT, HOWEVER,
AND COULD TRULY SAY THAT IT HAD DONE HER GOOD.  IT HAD INCREASED
HER COMFORTS BY MAKING HER FEEL HERSELF TO BE IN GOOD HANDS.
SHE HAD SEEN TOO MUCH OF THE WORLD, TO EXPECT SUDDEN OR DISINTERESTED
ATTACHMENT ANYWHERE, BUT HER ILLNESS HAD PROVED TO HER THAT HER LANDLADY
HAD A CHARACTER TO PRESERVE, AND WOULD NOT USE HER ILL; AND SHE HAD BEEN
PARTICULARLY FORTUNATE IN HER NURSE, AS A SISTER OF HER LANDLADY,
A NURSE BY PROFESSION, AND WHO HAD ALWAYS A HOME IN THAT HOUSE
WHEN UNEMPLOYED, CHANCED TO BE AT LIBERTY JUST IN TIME TO ATTEND HER.
"AND SHE," SAID MRS SMITH, "BESIDES NURSING ME MOST ADMIRABLY,
HAS REALLY PROVED AN INVALUABLE ACQUAINTANCE.  AS SOON AS I COULD
USE MY HANDS SHE TAUGHT ME TO KNIT, WHICH HAS BEEN A GREAT AMUSEMENT;
AND SHE PUT ME IN THE WAY OF MAKING THESE LITTLE THREAD-CASES,
PIN-CUSHIONS AND CARD-RACKS, WHICH YOU ALWAYS FIND ME SO BUSY ABOUT,
AND WHICH SUPPLY ME WITH THE MEANS OF DOING A LITTLE GOOD
TO ONE OR TWO VERY POOR FAMILIES IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD.
SHE HAD A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE, OF COURSE PROFESSIONALLY, AMONG THOSE
WHO CAN AFFORD TO BUY, AND SHE DISPOSES OF MY MERCHANDISE.
SHE ALWAYS TAKES THE RIGHT TIME FOR APPLYING.  EVERYBODY'S HEART IS OPEN,
YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY HAVE RECENTLY ESCAPED FROM SEVERE PAIN,
OR ARE RECOVERING THE BLESSING OF HEALTH, AND NURSE ROOKE
THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS WHEN TO SPEAK.  SHE IS A SHREWD, INTELLIGENT,
SENSIBLE WOMAN.  HERS IS A LINE FOR SEEING HUMAN NATURE; AND SHE HAS
A FUND OF GOOD SENSE AND OBSERVATION, WHICH, AS A COMPANION, MAKE HER
INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO THOUSANDS OF THOSE WHO HAVING ONLY RECEIVED
`THE BEST EDUCATION IN THE WORLD,' KNOW NOTHING WORTH ATTENDING TO.
CALL IT GOSSIP, IF YOU WILL, BUT WHEN NURSE ROOKE HAS HALF AN HOUR'S
LEISURE TO BESTOW ON ME, SHE IS SURE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO RELATE
THAT IS ENTERTAINING AND PROFITABLE:  SOMETHING THAT MAKES ONE
KNOW ONE'S SPECIES BETTER.  ONE LIKES TO HEAR WHAT IS GOING ON,
TO BE AU FAIT AS TO THE NEWEST MODES OF BEING TRIFLING AND SILLY.
TO ME, WHO LIVE SO MUCH ALONE, HER CONVERSATION, I ASSURE YOU, IS A TREAT."

ANNE, FAR FROM WISHING TO CAVIL AT THE PLEASURE, REPLIED,
"I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT.  WOMEN OF THAT CLASS HAVE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES,
AND IF THEY ARE INTELLIGENT MAY BE WELL WORTH LISTENING TO.
SUCH VARIETIES OF HUMAN NATURE AS THEY ARE IN THE HABIT OF WITNESSING!
AND IT IS NOT MERELY IN ITS FOLLIES, THAT THEY ARE WELL READ;
FOR THEY SEE IT OCCASIONALLY UNDER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT CAN BE
MOST INTERESTING OR AFFECTING.  WHAT INSTANCES MUST PASS BEFORE THEM
OF ARDENT, DISINTERESTED, SELF-DENYING ATTACHMENT, OF HEROISM, FORTITUDE,
PATIENCE, RESIGNATION:  OF ALL THE CONFLICTS AND ALL THE SACRIFICES
THAT ENNOBLE US MOST.  A SICK CHAMBER MAY OFTEN FURNISH
THE WORTH OF VOLUMES."

"YES," SAID MRS SMITH MORE DOUBTINGLY, "SOMETIMES IT MAY,
THOUGH I FEAR ITS LESSONS ARE NOT OFTEN IN THE ELEVATED STYLE YOU DESCRIBE.
HERE AND THERE, HUMAN NATURE MAY BE GREAT IN TIMES OF TRIAL;
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING, IT IS ITS WEAKNESS AND NOT ITS STRENGTH
THAT APPEARS IN A SICK CHAMBER:  IT IS SELFISHNESS AND IMPATIENCE
RATHER THAN GENEROSITY AND FORTITUDE, THAT ONE HEARS OF.
THERE IS SO LITTLE REAL FRIENDSHIP IN THE WORLD! AND UNFORTUNATELY"
(SPEAKING LOW AND TREMULOUSLY) "THERE ARE SO MANY WHO FORGET
TO THINK SERIOUSLY TILL IT IS ALMOST TOO LATE."

ANNE SAW THE MISERY OF SUCH FEELINGS.  THE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN
WHAT HE OUGHT, AND THE WIFE HAD BEEN LED AMONG THAT PART OF MANKIND
WHICH MADE HER THINK WORSE OF THE WORLD THAN SHE HOPED IT DESERVED.
IT WAS BUT A PASSING EMOTION HOWEVER WITH MRS SMITH; SHE SHOOK IT OFF,
AND SOON ADDED IN A DIFFERENT TONE--

"I DO NOT SUPPOSE THE SITUATION MY FRIEND MRS ROOKE IS IN AT PRESENT,
WILL FURNISH MUCH EITHER TO INTEREST OR EDIFY ME.  SHE IS ONLY NURSING
MRS WALLIS OF MARLBOROUGH BUILDINGS; A MERE PRETTY, SILLY, EXPENSIVE,
FASHIONABLE WOMAN, I BELIEVE; AND OF COURSE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT
BUT OF LACE AND FINERY.  I MEAN TO MAKE MY PROFIT OF MRS WALLIS, HOWEVER.
SHE HAS PLENTY OF MONEY, AND I INTEND SHE SHALL BUY ALL
THE HIGH-PRICED THINGS I HAVE IN HAND NOW."

ANNE HAD CALLED SEVERAL TIMES ON HER FRIEND, BEFORE THE EXISTENCE
OF SUCH A PERSON WAS KNOWN IN CAMDEN PLACE.  AT LAST, IT BECAME NECESSARY
TO SPEAK OF HER. SIR WALTER, ELIZABETH AND MRS CLAY, RETURNED ONE MORNING
FROM LAURA PLACE, WITH A SUDDEN INVITATION FROM LADY DALRYMPLE
FOR THE SAME EVENING, AND ANNE WAS ALREADY ENGAGED, TO SPEND THAT EVENING
IN WESTGATE BUILDINGS.  SHE WAS NOT SORRY FOR THE EXCUSE.
THEY WERE ONLY ASKED, SHE WAS SURE, BECAUSE LADY DALRYMPLE BEING
KEPT AT HOME BY A BAD COLD, WAS GLAD TO MAKE USE OF THE RELATIONSHIP
WHICH HAD BEEN SO PRESSED ON HER; AND SHE DECLINED ON HER OWN ACCOUNT
WITH GREAT ALACRITY--"SHE WAS ENGAGED TO SPEND THE EVENING
WITH AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW."  THEY WERE NOT MUCH INTERESTED IN ANYTHING
RELATIVE TO ANNE; BUT STILL THERE WERE QUESTIONS ENOUGH ASKED,
TO MAKE IT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS OLD SCHOOLFELLOW WAS; AND ELIZABETH
WAS DISDAINFUL, AND SIR WALTER SEVERE.

"WESTGATE BUILDINGS!" SAID HE, "AND WHO IS MISS ANNE ELLIOT
TO BE VISITING IN WESTGATE BUILDINGS?  A MRS SMITH.  A WIDOW MRS SMITH;
AND WHO WAS HER HUSBAND?  ONE OF FIVE THOUSAND MR SMITHS WHOSE NAMES
ARE TO BE MET WITH EVERYWHERE.  AND WHAT IS HER ATTRACTION?
THAT SHE IS OLD AND SICKLY.  UPON MY WORD, MISS ANNE ELLIOT,
YOU HAVE THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TASTE!  EVERYTHING THAT REVOLTS
OTHER PEOPLE, LOW COMPANY, PALTRY ROOMS, FOUL AIR, DISGUSTING ASSOCIATIONS
ARE INVITING TO YOU.  BUT SURELY YOU MAY PUT OFF THIS OLD LADY
TILL TO-MORROW:  SHE IS NOT SO NEAR HER END, I PRESUME,
BUT THAT SHE MAY HOPE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY.  WHAT IS HER AGE?  FORTY?"

"NO, SIR, SHE IS NOT ONE-AND-THIRTY; BUT I DO NOT THINK I CAN
PUT OFF MY ENGAGEMENT, BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY EVENING FOR SOME TIME
WHICH WILL AT ONCE SUIT HER AND MYSELF.  SHE GOES INTO THE WARM BATH
TO-MORROW, AND FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ENGAGED."

"BUT WHAT DOES LADY RUSSELL THINK OF THIS ACQUAINTANCE?" ASKED ELIZABETH.

"SHE SEES NOTHING TO BLAME IN IT," REPLIED ANNE; "ON THE CONTRARY,
SHE APPROVES IT, AND HAS GENERALLY TAKEN ME WHEN I HAVE
CALLED ON MRS SMITH.

"WESTGATE BUILDINGS MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER SURPRISED BY THE APPEARANCE
OF A CARRIAGE DRAWN UP NEAR ITS PAVEMENT," OBSERVED SIR WALTER.
"SIR HENRY RUSSELL'S WIDOW, INDEED, HAS NO HONOURS TO DISTINGUISH HER ARMS,
BUT STILL IT IS A HANDSOME EQUIPAGE, AND NO DOUBT IS WELL KNOWN
TO CONVEY A MISS ELLIOT.  A WIDOW MRS SMITH LODGING IN WESTGATE BUILDINGS!
A POOR WIDOW BARELY ABLE TO LIVE, BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY;
A MERE MRS SMITH, AN EVERY-DAY MRS SMITH, OF ALL PEOPLE AND ALL NAMES
IN THE WORLD, TO BE THE CHOSEN FRIEND OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT,
AND TO BE PREFERRED BY HER TO HER OWN FAMILY CONNECTIONS AMONG THE NOBILITY
OF ENGLAND AND IRELAND!  MRS SMITH!  SUCH A NAME!"

MRS CLAY, WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT WHILE ALL THIS PASSED, NOW THOUGHT IT
ADVISABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM, AND ANNE COULD HAVE SAID MUCH,
AND DID LONG TO SAY A LITTLE IN DEFENCE OF HER FRIEND'S
NOT VERY DISSIMILAR CLAIMS TO THEIRS, BUT HER SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPECT
TO HER FATHER PREVENTED HER.  SHE MADE NO REPLY.  SHE LEFT IT
TO HIMSELF TO RECOLLECT, THAT MRS SMITH WAS NOT THE ONLY WIDOW
IN BATH BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY, WITH LITTLE TO LIVE ON,
AND NO SURNAME OF DIGNITY.

ANNE KEPT HER APPOINTMENT; THE OTHERS KEPT THEIRS, AND OF COURSE
SHE HEARD THE NEXT MORNING THAT THEY HAD HAD A DELIGHTFUL EVENING.
SHE HAD BEEN THE ONLY ONE OF THE SET ABSENT, FOR SIR WALTER
AND ELIZABETH HAD NOT ONLY BEEN QUITE AT HER LADYSHIP'S SERVICE THEMSELVES,
BUT HAD ACTUALLY BEEN HAPPY TO BE EMPLOYED BY HER IN COLLECTING OTHERS,
AND HAD BEEN AT THE TROUBLE OF INVITING BOTH LADY RUSSELL AND MR ELLIOT;
AND MR ELLIOT HAD MADE A POINT OF LEAVING COLONEL WALLIS EARLY,
AND LADY RUSSELL HAD FRESH ARRANGED ALL HER EVENING ENGAGEMENTS
IN ORDER TO WAIT ON HER.  ANNE HAD THE WHOLE HISTORY OF ALL THAT
SUCH AN EVENING COULD SUPPLY FROM LADY RUSSELL.  TO HER,
ITS GREATEST INTEREST MUST BE, IN HAVING BEEN VERY MUCH TALKED OF
BETWEEN HER FRIEND AND MR ELLIOT; IN HAVING BEEN WISHED FOR, REGRETTED,
AND AT THE SAME TIME HONOURED FOR STAYING AWAY IN SUCH A CAUSE.
HER KIND, COMPASSIONATE VISITS TO THIS OLD SCHOOLFELLOW,
SICK AND REDUCED, SEEMED TO HAVE QUITE DELIGHTED MR ELLIOT.
HE THOUGHT HER A MOST EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG WOMAN; IN HER TEMPER, MANNERS,
MIND, A MODEL OF FEMALE EXCELLENCE.  HE COULD MEET EVEN LADY RUSSELL
IN A DISCUSSION OF HER MERITS; AND ANNE COULD NOT BE GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND
SO MUCH BY HER FRIEND, COULD NOT KNOW HERSELF TO BE SO HIGHLY RATED
BY A SENSIBLE MAN, WITHOUT MANY OF THOSE AGREEABLE SENSATIONS
WHICH HER FRIEND MEANT TO CREATE.

LADY RUSSELL WAS NOW PERFECTLY DECIDED IN HER OPINION OF MR ELLIOT.
SHE WAS AS MUCH CONVINCED OF HIS MEANING TO GAIN ANNE IN TIME AS OF
HIS DESERVING HER, AND WAS BEGINNING TO CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF WEEKS
WHICH WOULD FREE HIM FROM ALL THE REMAINING RESTRAINTS OF WIDOWHOOD,
AND LEAVE HIM AT LIBERTY TO EXERT HIS MOST OPEN POWERS OF PLEASING.
SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK TO ANNE WITH HALF THE CERTAINTY SHE FELT ON THE SUBJECT,
SHE WOULD VENTURE ON LITTLE MORE THAN HINTS OF WHAT MIGHT BE HEREAFTER,
OF A POSSIBLE ATTACHMENT ON HIS SIDE, OF THE DESIRABLENESS OF THE ALLIANCE,
SUPPOSING SUCH ATTACHMENT TO BE REAL AND RETURNED.  ANNE HEARD HER,
AND MADE NO VIOLENT EXCLAMATIONS; SHE ONLY SMILED, BLUSHED,
AND GENTLY SHOOK HER HEAD.

"I AM NO MATCH-MAKER, AS YOU WELL KNOW," SAID LADY RUSSELL,
"BEING MUCH TOO WELL AWARE OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF ALL HUMAN EVENTS
AND CALCULATIONS.  I ONLY MEAN THAT IF MR ELLIOT SHOULD SOME TIME HENCE
PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO YOU, AND IF YOU SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO ACCEPT HIM,
I THINK THERE WOULD BE EVERY POSSIBILITY OF YOUR BEING HAPPY TOGETHER.
A MOST SUITABLE CONNECTION EVERYBODY MUST CONSIDER IT, BUT I THINK
IT MIGHT BE A VERY HAPPY ONE."

"MR ELLIOT IS AN EXCEEDINGLY AGREEABLE MAN, AND IN MANY RESPECTS
I THINK HIGHLY OF HIM," SAID ANNE; "BUT WE SHOULD NOT SUIT."

LADY RUSSELL LET THIS PASS, AND ONLY SAID IN REJOINDER, "I OWN THAT
TO BE ABLE TO REGARD YOU AS THE FUTURE MISTRESS OF KELLYNCH,
THE FUTURE LADY ELLIOT, TO LOOK FORWARD AND SEE YOU OCCUPYING
YOUR DEAR MOTHER'S PLACE, SUCCEEDING TO ALL HER RIGHTS,
AND ALL HER POPULARITY, AS WELL AS TO ALL HER VIRTUES, WOULD BE
THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE GRATIFICATION TO ME.  YOU ARE YOUR MOTHER'S SELF
IN COUNTENANCE AND DISPOSITION; AND IF I MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO FANCY YOU
SUCH AS SHE WAS, IN SITUATION AND NAME, AND HOME, PRESIDING AND BLESSING
IN THE SAME SPOT, AND ONLY SUPERIOR TO HER IN BEING MORE HIGHLY VALUED!
MY DEAREST ANNE, IT WOULD GIVE ME MORE DELIGHT THAN IS OFTEN FELT
AT MY TIME OF LIFE!"

ANNE WAS OBLIGED TO TURN AWAY, TO RISE, TO WALK TO A DISTANT TABLE,
AND, LEANING THERE IN PRETENDED EMPLOYMENT, TRY TO SUBDUE THE FEELINGS
THIS PICTURE EXCITED.  FOR A FEW MOMENTS HER IMAGINATION AND HER HEART
WERE BEWITCHED.  THE IDEA OF BECOMING WHAT HER MOTHER HAD BEEN;
OF HAVING THE PRECIOUS NAME OF "LADY ELLIOT" FIRST REVIVED IN HERSELF;
OF BEING RESTORED TO KELLYNCH, CALLING IT HER HOME AGAIN,
HER HOME FOR EVER, WAS A CHARM WHICH SHE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY RESIST.
LADY RUSSELL SAID NOT ANOTHER WORD, WILLING TO LEAVE THE MATTER
TO ITS OWN OPERATION; AND BELIEVING THAT, COULD MR ELLIOT AT THAT MOMENT
WITH PROPRIETY HAVE SPOKEN FOR HIMSELF!--SHE BELIEVED, IN SHORT,
WHAT ANNE DID NOT BELIEVE.  THE SAME IMAGE OF MR ELLIOT SPEAKING
FOR HIMSELF BROUGHT ANNE TO COMPOSURE AGAIN.  THE CHARM OF KELLYNCH
AND OF "LADY ELLIOT" ALL FADED AWAY.  SHE NEVER COULD ACCEPT HIM.
AND IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT HER FEELINGS WERE STILL ADVERSE TO ANY MAN
SAVE ONE; HER JUDGEMENT, ON A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THE POSSIBILITIES
OF SUCH A CASE WAS AGAINST MR ELLIOT.

THOUGH THEY HAD NOW BEEN ACQUAINTED A MONTH, SHE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED
THAT SHE REALLY KNEW HIS CHARACTER.  THAT HE WAS A SENSIBLE MAN,
AN AGREEABLE MAN, THAT HE TALKED WELL, PROFESSED GOOD OPINIONS,
SEEMED TO JUDGE PROPERLY AND AS A MAN OF PRINCIPLE, THIS WAS ALL
CLEAR ENOUGH.  HE CERTAINLY KNEW WHAT WAS RIGHT, NOR COULD SHE FIX
ON ANY ONE ARTICLE OF MORAL DUTY EVIDENTLY TRANSGRESSED; BUT YET SHE WOULD
HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO ANSWER FOR HIS CONDUCT.  SHE DISTRUSTED THE PAST,
IF NOT THE PRESENT.  THE NAMES WHICH OCCASIONALLY DROPT
OF FORMER ASSOCIATES, THE ALLUSIONS TO FORMER PRACTICES AND PURSUITS,
SUGGESTED SUSPICIONS NOT FAVOURABLE OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN.
SHE SAW THAT THERE HAD BEEN BAD HABITS; THAT SUNDAY TRAVELLING
HAD BEEN A COMMON THING; THAT THERE HAD BEEN A PERIOD OF HIS LIFE
(AND PROBABLY NOT A SHORT ONE) WHEN HE HAD BEEN, AT LEAST,
CARELESS IN ALL SERIOUS MATTERS; AND, THOUGH HE MIGHT NOW THINK
VERY DIFFERENTLY, WHO COULD ANSWER FOR THE TRUE SENTIMENTS OF A CLEVER,
CAUTIOUS MAN, GROWN OLD ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE A FAIR CHARACTER?
HOW COULD IT EVER BE ASCERTAINED THAT HIS MIND WAS TRULY CLEANSED?

MR ELLIOT WAS RATIONAL, DISCREET, POLISHED, BUT HE WAS NOT OPEN.
THERE WAS NEVER ANY BURST OF FEELING, ANY WARMTH OF INDIGNATION OR DELIGHT,
AT THE EVIL OR GOOD OF OTHERS.  THIS, TO ANNE, WAS A DECIDED IMPERFECTION.
HER EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE INCURABLE.  SHE PRIZED THE FRANK,
THE OPEN-HEARTED, THE EAGER CHARACTER BEYOND ALL OTHERS.
WARMTH AND ENTHUSIASM DID CAPTIVATE HER STILL.  SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD
SO MUCH MORE DEPEND UPON THE SINCERITY OF THOSE WHO SOMETIMES LOOKED
OR SAID A CARELESS OR A HASTY THING, THAN OF THOSE WHOSE PRESENCE OF MIND
NEVER VARIED, WHOSE TONGUE NEVER SLIPPED.

MR ELLIOT WAS TOO GENERALLY AGREEABLE.  VARIOUS AS WERE THE TEMPERS
IN HER FATHER'S HOUSE, HE PLEASED THEM ALL.  HE ENDURED TOO WELL,
STOOD TOO WELL WITH EVERY BODY.  HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER WITH SOME
DEGREE OF OPENNESS OF MRS CLAY; HAD APPEARED COMPLETELY TO SEE
WHAT MRS CLAY WAS ABOUT, AND TO HOLD HER IN CONTEMPT; AND YET
MRS CLAY FOUND HIM AS AGREEABLE AS ANY BODY.

LADY RUSSELL SAW EITHER LESS OR MORE THAN HER YOUNG FRIEND,
FOR SHE SAW NOTHING TO EXCITE DISTRUST.  SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE
A MAN MORE EXACTLY WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE THAN MR ELLIOT; NOR DID SHE
EVER ENJOY A SWEETER FEELING THAN THE HOPE OF SEEING HIM RECEIVE
THE HAND OF HER BELOVED ANNE IN KELLYNCH CHURCH, IN THE COURSE OF
THE FOLLOWING AUTUMN.



CHAPTER 18


IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY; AND ANNE, HAVING BEEN A MONTH IN BATH,
WAS GROWING VERY EAGER FOR NEWS FROM UPPERCROSS AND LYME.
SHE WANTED TO HEAR MUCH MORE THAN MARY HAD COMMUNICATED.
IT WAS THREE WEEKS SINCE SHE HAD HEARD AT ALL.  SHE ONLY KNEW
THAT HENRIETTA WAS AT HOME AGAIN; AND THAT LOUISA, THOUGH CONSIDERED TO BE
RECOVERING FAST, WAS STILL IN LYME; AND SHE WAS THINKING OF THEM ALL
VERY INTENTLY ONE EVENING, WHEN A THICKER LETTER THAN USUAL FROM MARY
WAS DELIVERED TO HER; AND, TO QUICKEN THE PLEASURE AND SURPRISE,
WITH ADMIRAL AND MRS CROFT'S COMPLIMENTS.

THE CROFTS MUST BE IN BATH!  A CIRCUMSTANCE TO INTEREST HER.
THEY WERE PEOPLE WHOM HER HEART TURNED TO VERY NATURALLY.

"WHAT IS THIS?" CRIED SIR WALTER.  "THE CROFTS HAVE ARRIVED IN BATH?
THE CROFTS WHO RENT KELLYNCH?  WHAT HAVE THEY BROUGHT YOU?"

"A LETTER FROM UPPERCROSS COTTAGE, SIR."

"OH! THOSE LETTERS ARE CONVENIENT PASSPORTS.  THEY SECURE AN INTRODUCTION.
I SHOULD HAVE VISITED ADMIRAL CROFT, HOWEVER, AT ANY RATE.
I KNOW WHAT IS DUE TO MY TENANT."

ANNE COULD LISTEN NO LONGER; SHE COULD NOT EVEN HAVE TOLD HOW
THE POOR ADMIRAL'S COMPLEXION ESCAPED; HER LETTER ENGROSSED HER.
IT HAD BEEN BEGUN SEVERAL DAYS BACK.


            "FEBRUARY 1ST.

"MY DEAR ANNE,--I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR MY SILENCE, BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW LITTLE PEOPLE THINK OF LETTERS IN SUCH A PLACE AS BATH.
YOU MUST BE A GREAT DEAL TOO HAPPY TO CARE FOR UPPERCROSS, WHICH,
AS YOU WELL KNOW, AFFORDS LITTLE TO WRITE ABOUT.  WE HAVE HAD
A VERY DULL CHRISTMAS; MR AND MRS MUSGROVE HAVE NOT HAD ONE DINNER PARTY
ALL THE HOLIDAYS.  I DO NOT RECKON THE HAYTERS AS ANYBODY.
THE HOLIDAYS, HOWEVER, ARE OVER AT LAST:  I BELIEVE NO CHILDREN EVER HAD
SUCH LONG ONES.  I AM SURE I HAD NOT.  THE HOUSE WAS CLEARED YESTERDAY,
EXCEPT OF THE LITTLE HARVILLES; BUT YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO HEAR
THEY HAVE NEVER GONE HOME.  MRS HARVILLE MUST BE AN ODD MOTHER
TO PART WITH THEM SO LONG.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT.  THEY ARE
NOT AT ALL NICE CHILDREN, IN MY OPINION; BUT MRS MUSGROVE SEEMS TO
LIKE THEM QUITE AS WELL, IF NOT BETTER, THAN HER GRANDCHILDREN.
WHAT DREADFUL WEATHER WE HAVE HAD!  IT MAY NOT BE FELT IN BATH,
WITH YOUR NICE PAVEMENTS; BUT IN THE COUNTRY IT IS OF SOME CONSEQUENCE.
I HAVE NOT HAD A CREATURE CALL ON ME SINCE THE SECOND WEEK IN JANUARY,
EXCEPT CHARLES HAYTER, WHO HAD BEEN CALLING MUCH OFTENER THAN WAS WELCOME.
BETWEEN OURSELVES, I THINK IT A GREAT PITY HENRIETTA DID NOT REMAIN AT LYME
AS LONG AS LOUISA; IT WOULD HAVE KEPT HER A LITTLE OUT OF HIS WAY.
THE CARRIAGE IS GONE TO-DAY, TO BRING LOUISA AND THE HARVILLES TO-MORROW.
WE ARE NOT ASKED TO DINE WITH THEM, HOWEVER, TILL THE DAY AFTER,
MRS MUSGROVE IS SO AFRAID OF HER BEING FATIGUED BY THE JOURNEY,
WHICH IS NOT VERY LIKELY, CONSIDERING THE CARE THAT WILL BE TAKEN OF HER;
AND IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE CONVENIENT TO ME TO DINE THERE TO-MORROW.
I AM GLAD YOU FIND MR ELLIOT SO AGREEABLE, AND WISH I COULD BE ACQUAINTED
WITH HIM TOO; BUT I HAVE MY USUAL LUCK:  I AM ALWAYS OUT OF THE WAY
WHEN ANY THING DESIRABLE IS GOING ON; ALWAYS THE LAST OF MY FAMILY
TO BE NOTICED.  WHAT AN IMMENSE TIME MRS CLAY HAS BEEN STAYING
WITH ELIZABETH!  DOES SHE NEVER MEAN TO GO AWAY?  BUT PERHAPS
IF SHE WERE TO LEAVE THE ROOM VACANT, WE MIGHT NOT BE INVITED.
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS.  I DO NOT EXPECT MY CHILDREN
TO BE ASKED, YOU KNOW.  I CAN LEAVE THEM AT THE GREAT HOUSE VERY WELL,
FOR A MONTH OR SIX WEEKS.  I HAVE THIS MOMENT HEARD THAT THE CROFTS
ARE GOING TO BATH ALMOST IMMEDIATELY; THEY THINK THE ADMIRAL GOUTY.
CHARLES HEARD IT QUITE BY CHANCE; THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE CIVILITY
TO GIVE ME ANY NOTICE, OR OF OFFERING TO TAKE ANYTHING.
I DO NOT THINK THEY IMPROVE AT ALL AS NEIGHBOURS.  WE SEE NOTHING OF THEM,
AND THIS IS REALLY AN INSTANCE OF GROSS INATTENTION.  CHARLES JOINS ME
IN LOVE, AND EVERYTHING PROPER.  YOURS AFFECTIONATELY,

  "MARY M---.

"I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT I AM VERY FAR FROM WELL; AND JEMIMA HAS
JUST TOLD ME THAT THE BUTCHER SAYS THERE IS A BAD SORE-THROAT
VERY MUCH ABOUT.  I DARE SAY I SHALL CATCH IT; AND MY SORE-THROATS,
YOU KNOW, ARE ALWAYS WORSE THAN ANYBODY'S."


SO ENDED THE FIRST PART, WHICH HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS PUT INTO AN ENVELOPE,
CONTAINING NEARLY AS MUCH MORE.


"I KEPT MY LETTER OPEN, THAT I MIGHT SEND YOU WORD HOW LOUISA
BORE HER JOURNEY, AND NOW I AM EXTREMELY GLAD I DID, HAVING A GREAT DEAL
TO ADD.  IN THE FIRST PLACE, I HAD A NOTE FROM MRS CROFT YESTERDAY,
OFFERING TO CONVEY ANYTHING TO YOU; A VERY KIND, FRIENDLY NOTE INDEED,
ADDRESSED TO ME, JUST AS IT OUGHT; I SHALL THEREFORE BE ABLE TO
MAKE MY LETTER AS LONG AS I LIKE.  THE ADMIRAL DOES NOT SEEM VERY ILL,
AND I SINCERELY HOPE BATH WILL DO HIM ALL THE GOOD HE WANTS.
I SHALL BE TRULY GLAD TO HAVE THEM BACK AGAIN.  OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD
CANNOT SPARE SUCH A PLEASANT FAMILY.  BUT NOW FOR LOUISA.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO COMMUNICATE THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU NOT A LITTLE.
SHE AND THE HARVILLES CAME ON TUESDAY VERY SAFELY, AND IN THE EVENING
WE WENT TO ASK HER HOW SHE DID, WHEN WE WERE RATHER SURPRISED
NOT TO FIND CAPTAIN BENWICK OF THE PARTY, FOR HE HAD BEEN INVITED
AS WELL AS THE HARVILLES; AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE REASON?
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HIS BEING IN LOVE WITH LOUISA,
AND NOT CHOOSING TO VENTURE TO UPPERCROSS TILL HE HAD HAD AN ANSWER
FROM MR MUSGROVE; FOR IT WAS ALL SETTLED BETWEEN HIM AND HER
BEFORE SHE CAME AWAY, AND HE HAD WRITTEN TO HER FATHER BY CAPTAIN HARVILLE.
TRUE, UPON MY HONOUR!  ARE NOT YOU ASTONISHED?  I SHALL BE SURPRISED
AT LEAST IF YOU EVER RECEIVED A HINT OF IT, FOR I NEVER DID.
MRS MUSGROVE PROTESTS SOLEMNLY THAT SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MATTER.
WE ARE ALL VERY WELL PLEASED, HOWEVER, FOR THOUGH IT IS NOT EQUAL TO HER
MARRYING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IT IS INFINITELY BETTER THAN CHARLES HAYTER;
AND MR MUSGROVE HAS WRITTEN HIS CONSENT, AND CAPTAIN BENWICK
IS EXPECTED TO-DAY.  MRS HARVILLE SAYS HER HUSBAND FEELS A GOOD DEAL
ON HIS POOR SISTER'S ACCOUNT; BUT, HOWEVER, LOUISA IS A GREAT FAVOURITE
WITH BOTH.  INDEED, MRS HARVILLE AND I QUITE AGREE THAT WE LOVE HER
THE BETTER FOR HAVING NURSED HER.  CHARLES WONDERS WHAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
WILL SAY; BUT IF YOU REMEMBER, I NEVER THOUGHT HIM ATTACHED TO LOUISA;
I NEVER COULD SEE ANYTHING OF IT.  AND THIS IS THE END, YOU SEE,
OF CAPTAIN BENWICK'S BEING SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADMIRER OF YOURS.
HOW CHARLES COULD TAKE SUCH A THING INTO HIS HEAD WAS ALWAYS
INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME.  I HOPE HE WILL BE MORE AGREEABLE NOW.
CERTAINLY NOT A GREAT MATCH FOR LOUISA MUSGROVE, BUT A MILLION TIMES BETTER
THAN MARRYING AMONG THE HAYTERS."


MARY NEED NOT HAVE FEARED HER SISTER'S BEING IN ANY DEGREE PREPARED
FOR THE NEWS.  SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE BEEN MORE ASTONISHED.
CAPTAIN BENWICK AND LOUISA MUSGROVE!  IT WAS ALMOST TOO WONDERFUL
FOR BELIEF, AND IT WAS WITH THE GREATEST EFFORT THAT SHE COULD REMAIN
IN THE ROOM, PRESERVE AN AIR OF CALMNESS, AND ANSWER THE COMMON QUESTIONS
OF THE MOMENT.  HAPPILY FOR HER, THEY WERE NOT MANY.  SIR WALTER
WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER THE CROFTS TRAVELLED WITH FOUR HORSES,
AND WHETHER THEY WERE LIKELY TO BE SITUATED IN SUCH A PART OF BATH
AS IT MIGHT SUIT MISS ELLIOT AND HIMSELF TO VISIT IN; BUT HAD
LITTLE CURIOSITY BEYOND.

"HOW IS MARY?" SAID ELIZABETH; AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER,
"AND PRAY WHAT BRINGS THE CROFTS TO BATH?"

"THEY COME ON THE ADMIRAL'S ACCOUNT.  HE IS THOUGHT TO BE GOUTY."

"GOUT AND DECREPITUDE!" SAID SIR WALTER.  "POOR OLD GENTLEMAN."

"HAVE THEY ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE?" ASKED ELIZABETH.

"I DO NOT KNOW; BUT I CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE THAT, AT ADMIRAL CROFT'S
TIME OF LIFE, AND IN HIS PROFESSION, HE SHOULD NOT HAVE MANY ACQUAINTANCE
IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS."

"I SUSPECT," SAID SIR WALTER COOLLY, "THAT ADMIRAL CROFT
WILL BE BEST KNOWN IN BATH AS THE RENTER OF KELLYNCH HALL.
ELIZABETH, MAY WE VENTURE TO PRESENT HIM AND HIS WIFE IN LAURA PLACE?"

"OH, NO! I THINK NOT.  SITUATED AS WE ARE WITH LADY DALRYMPLE, COUSINS,
WE OUGHT TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO EMBARRASS HER WITH ACQUAINTANCE
SHE MIGHT NOT APPROVE.  IF WE WERE NOT RELATED, IT WOULD NOT SIGNIFY;
BUT AS COUSINS, SHE WOULD FEEL SCRUPULOUS AS TO ANY PROPOSAL OF OURS.
WE HAD BETTER LEAVE THE CROFTS TO FIND THEIR OWN LEVEL.
THERE ARE SEVERAL ODD-LOOKING MEN WALKING ABOUT HERE, WHO,
I AM TOLD, ARE SAILORS.  THE CROFTS WILL ASSOCIATE WITH THEM."

THIS WAS SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH'S SHARE OF INTEREST IN THE LETTER;
WHEN MRS CLAY HAD PAID HER TRIBUTE OF MORE DECENT ATTENTION,
IN AN ENQUIRY AFTER MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE, AND HER FINE LITTLE BOYS,
ANNE WAS AT LIBERTY.

IN HER OWN ROOM, SHE TRIED TO COMPREHEND IT.  WELL MIGHT CHARLES WONDER
HOW CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WOULD FEEL!  PERHAPS HE HAD QUITTED THE FIELD,
HAD GIVEN LOUISA UP, HAD CEASED TO LOVE, HAD FOUND HE DID NOT LOVE HER.
SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE IDEA OF TREACHERY OR LEVITY, OR ANYTHING
AKIN TO ILL USAGE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS FRIEND.  SHE COULD NOT ENDURE
THAT SUCH A FRIENDSHIP AS THEIRS SHOULD BE SEVERED UNFAIRLY.

CAPTAIN BENWICK AND LOUISA MUSGROVE!  THE HIGH-SPIRITED,
JOYOUS-TALKING LOUISA MUSGROVE, AND THE DEJECTED, THINKING,
FEELING, READING, CAPTAIN BENWICK, SEEMED EACH OF THEM EVERYTHING
THAT WOULD NOT SUIT THE OTHER.  THEIR MINDS MOST DISSIMILAR!
WHERE COULD HAVE BEEN THE ATTRACTION?  THE ANSWER SOON PRESENTED ITSELF.
IT HAD BEEN IN SITUATION.  THEY HAD BEEN THROWN TOGETHER SEVERAL WEEKS;
THEY HAD BEEN LIVING IN THE SAME SMALL FAMILY PARTY:  SINCE HENRIETTA'S
COMING AWAY, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DEPENDING ALMOST ENTIRELY ON EACH OTHER,
AND LOUISA, JUST RECOVERING FROM ILLNESS, HAD BEEN IN AN INTERESTING STATE,
AND CAPTAIN BENWICK WAS NOT INCONSOLABLE.  THAT WAS A POINT WHICH ANNE
HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO AVOID SUSPECTING BEFORE; AND INSTEAD OF DRAWING
THE SAME CONCLUSION AS MARY, FROM THE PRESENT COURSE OF EVENTS,
THEY SERVED ONLY TO CONFIRM THE IDEA OF HIS HAVING FELT SOME
DAWNING OF TENDERNESS TOWARD HERSELF.  SHE DID NOT MEAN, HOWEVER,
TO DERIVE MUCH MORE FROM IT TO GRATIFY HER VANITY, THAN MARY
MIGHT HAVE ALLOWED.  SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT ANY TOLERABLY PLEASING
YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD LISTENED AND SEEMED TO FEEL FOR HIM WOULD HAVE
RECEIVED THE SAME COMPLIMENT.  HE HAD AN AFFECTIONATE HEART.
HE MUST LOVE SOMEBODY.

SHE SAW NO REASON AGAINST THEIR BEING HAPPY.  LOUISA HAD FINE
NAVAL FERVOUR TO BEGIN WITH, AND THEY WOULD SOON GROW MORE ALIKE.
HE WOULD GAIN CHEERFULNESS, AND SHE WOULD LEARN TO BE AN ENTHUSIAST
FOR SCOTT AND LORD BYRON; NAY, THAT WAS PROBABLY LEARNT ALREADY;
OF COURSE THEY HAD FALLEN IN LOVE OVER POETRY.  THE IDEA OF
LOUISA MUSGROVE TURNED INTO A PERSON OF LITERARY TASTE,
AND SENTIMENTAL REFLECTION WAS AMUSING, BUT SHE HAD NO DOUBT
OF ITS BEING SO.  THE DAY AT LYME, THE FALL FROM THE COBB,
MIGHT INFLUENCE HER HEALTH, HER NERVES, HER COURAGE, HER CHARACTER TO
THE END OF HER LIFE, AS THOROUGHLY AS IT APPEARED TO HAVE
INFLUENCED HER FATE.

THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE WAS, THAT IF THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN SENSIBLE
OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MERITS COULD BE ALLOWED TO PREFER ANOTHER MAN,
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE ENGAGEMENT TO EXCITE LASTING WONDER;
AND IF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH LOST NO FRIEND BY IT, CERTAINLY NOTHING
TO BE REGRETTED.  NO, IT WAS NOT REGRET WHICH MADE ANNE'S HEART
BEAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF, AND BROUGHT THE COLOUR INTO HER CHEEKS
WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH UNSHACKLED AND FREE.
SHE HAD SOME FEELINGS WHICH SHE WAS ASHAMED TO INVESTIGATE.
THEY WERE TOO MUCH LIKE JOY, SENSELESS JOY!

SHE LONGED TO SEE THE CROFTS; BUT WHEN THE MEETING TOOK PLACE,
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT NO RUMOUR OF THE NEWS HAD YET REACHED THEM.
THE VISIT OF CEREMONY WAS PAID AND RETURNED; AND LOUISA MUSGROVE
WAS MENTIONED, AND CAPTAIN BENWICK, TOO, WITHOUT EVEN HALF A SMILE.

THE CROFTS HAD PLACED THEMSELVES IN LODGINGS IN GAY STREET,
PERFECTLY TO SIR WALTER'S SATISFACTION.  HE WAS NOT AT ALL ASHAMED
OF THE ACQUAINTANCE, AND DID, IN FACT, THINK AND TALK A GREAT DEAL MORE
ABOUT THE ADMIRAL, THAN THE ADMIRAL EVER THOUGHT OR TALKED ABOUT HIM.

THE CROFTS KNEW QUITE AS MANY PEOPLE IN BATH AS THEY WISHED FOR,
AND CONSIDERED THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH THE ELLIOTS AS A MERE MATTER OF FORM,
AND NOT IN THE LEAST LIKELY TO AFFORD THEM ANY PLEASURE.
THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM THEIR COUNTRY HABIT OF BEING ALMOST ALWAYS TOGETHER.
HE WAS ORDERED TO WALK TO KEEP OFF THE GOUT, AND MRS CROFT
SEEMED TO GO SHARES WITH HIM IN EVERYTHING, AND TO WALK
FOR HER LIFE TO DO HIM GOOD.  ANNE SAW THEM WHEREVER SHE WENT.
LADY RUSSELL TOOK HER OUT IN HER CARRIAGE ALMOST EVERY MORNING,
AND SHE NEVER FAILED TO THINK OF THEM, AND NEVER FAILED TO SEE THEM.
KNOWING THEIR FEELINGS AS SHE DID, IT WAS A MOST ATTRACTIVE PICTURE
OF HAPPINESS TO HER.  SHE ALWAYS WATCHED THEM AS LONG AS SHE COULD,
DELIGHTED TO FANCY SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY MIGHT BE TALKING OF,
AS THEY WALKED ALONG IN HAPPY INDEPENDENCE, OR EQUALLY DELIGHTED
TO SEE THE ADMIRAL'S HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED
AN OLD FRIEND, AND OBSERVE THEIR EAGERNESS OF CONVERSATION
WHEN OCCASIONALLY FORMING INTO A LITTLE KNOT OF THE NAVY, MRS CROFT
LOOKING AS INTELLIGENT AND KEEN AS ANY OF THE OFFICERS AROUND HER.

ANNE WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED WITH LADY RUSSELL TO BE OFTEN WALKING HERSELF;
BUT IT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE MORNING, ABOUT A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
AFTER THE CROFT'S ARRIVAL, IT SUITED HER BEST TO LEAVE HER FRIEND,
OR HER FRIEND'S CARRIAGE, IN THE LOWER PART OF THE TOWN,
AND RETURN ALONE TO CAMDEN PLACE, AND IN WALKING UP MILSOM STREET
SHE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO MEET WITH THE ADMIRAL.  HE WAS STANDING
BY HIMSELF AT A PRINTSHOP WINDOW, WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM,
IN EARNEST CONTEMPLATION OF SOME PRINT, AND SHE NOT ONLY MIGHT HAVE
PASSED HIM UNSEEN, BUT WAS OBLIGED TO TOUCH AS WELL AS ADDRESS HIM
BEFORE SHE COULD CATCH HIS NOTICE.  WHEN HE DID PERCEIVE AND
ACKNOWLEDGE HER, HOWEVER, IT WAS DONE WITH ALL HIS USUAL FRANKNESS
AND GOOD HUMOUR.  "HA! IS IT YOU?  THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
THIS IS TREATING ME LIKE A FRIEND.  HERE I AM, YOU SEE,
STARING AT A PICTURE.  I CAN NEVER GET BY THIS SHOP WITHOUT STOPPING.
BUT WHAT A THING HERE IS, BY WAY OF A BOAT!  DO LOOK AT IT.
DID YOU EVER SEE THE LIKE?  WHAT QUEER FELLOWS YOUR FINE PAINTERS MUST BE,
TO THINK THAT ANYBODY WOULD VENTURE THEIR LIVES IN SUCH A SHAPELESS
OLD COCKLESHELL AS THAT?  AND YET HERE ARE TWO GENTLEMEN
STUCK UP IN IT MIGHTILY AT THEIR EASE, AND LOOKING ABOUT THEM AT THE ROCKS
AND MOUNTAINS, AS IF THEY WERE NOT TO BE UPSET THE NEXT MOMENT,
WHICH THEY CERTAINLY MUST BE.  I WONDER WHERE THAT BOAT WAS BUILT!"
(LAUGHING HEARTILY); "I WOULD NOT VENTURE OVER A HORSEPOND IN IT.
WELL," (TURNING AWAY), "NOW, WHERE ARE YOU BOUND?  CAN I GO ANYWHERE
FOR YOU, OR WITH YOU?  CAN I BE OF ANY USE?"

"NONE, I THANK YOU, UNLESS YOU WILL GIVE ME THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY
THE LITTLE WAY OUR ROAD LIES TOGETHER.  I AM GOING HOME."


"THAT I WILL, WITH ALL MY HEART, AND FARTHER, TOO.  YES, YES
WE WILL HAVE A SNUG WALK TOGETHER, AND I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
AS WE GO ALONG.  THERE, TAKE MY ARM; THAT'S RIGHT; I DO NOT
FEEL COMFORTABLE IF I HAVE NOT A WOMAN THERE.  LORD! WHAT A BOAT IT IS!"
TAKING A LAST LOOK AT THE PICTURE, AS THEY BEGAN TO BE IN MOTION.

"DID YOU SAY THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING TO TELL ME, SIR?"

"YES, I HAVE, PRESENTLY.  BUT HERE COMES A FRIEND, CAPTAIN BRIGDEN;
I SHALL ONLY SAY, `HOW D'YE DO?' AS WE PASS, HOWEVER.  I SHALL NOT STOP.
`HOW D'YE DO?'  BRIGDEN STARES TO SEE ANYBODY WITH ME BUT MY WIFE.
SHE, POOR SOUL, IS TIED BY THE LEG.  SHE HAS A BLISTER ON ONE OF HER HEELS,
AS LARGE AS A THREE-SHILLING PIECE.  IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE STREET,
YOU WILL SEE ADMIRAL BRAND COMING DOWN AND HIS BROTHER.  SHABBY FELLOWS,
BOTH OF THEM!  I AM GLAD THEY ARE NOT ON THIS SIDE OF THE WAY.
SOPHY CANNOT BEAR THEM.  THEY PLAYED ME A PITIFUL TRICK ONCE:
GOT AWAY WITH SOME OF MY BEST MEN.  I WILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
ANOTHER TIME.  THERE COMES OLD SIR ARCHIBALD DREW AND HIS GRANDSON.
LOOK, HE SEES US; HE KISSES HIS HAND TO YOU; HE TAKES YOU FOR MY WIFE.
AH! THE PEACE HAS COME TOO SOON FOR THAT YOUNKER.  POOR OLD SIR ARCHIBALD!
HOW DO YOU LIKE BATH, MISS ELLIOT?  IT SUITS US VERY WELL.
WE ARE ALWAYS MEETING WITH SOME OLD FRIEND OR OTHER; THE STREETS
FULL OF THEM EVERY MORNING; SURE TO HAVE PLENTY OF CHAT;
AND THEN WE GET AWAY FROM THEM ALL, AND SHUT OURSELVES IN OUR LODGINGS,
AND DRAW IN OUR CHAIRS, AND ARE SNUG AS IF WE WERE AT KELLYNCH,
AY, OR AS WE USED TO BE EVEN AT NORTH YARMOUTH AND DEAL.
WE DO NOT LIKE OUR LODGINGS HERE THE WORSE, I CAN TELL YOU,
FOR PUTTING US IN MIND OF THOSE WE FIRST HAD AT NORTH YARMOUTH.
THE WIND BLOWS THROUGH ONE OF THE CUPBOARDS JUST IN THE SAME WAY."

WHEN THEY WERE GOT A LITTLE FARTHER, ANNE VENTURED TO PRESS AGAIN
FOR WHAT HE HAD TO COMMUNICATE.  SHE HOPED WHEN CLEAR OF MILSOM STREET
TO HAVE HER CURIOSITY GRATIFIED; BUT SHE WAS STILL OBLIGED TO WAIT,
FOR THE ADMIRAL HAD MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO BEGIN TILL THEY HAD
GAINED THE GREATER SPACE AND QUIET OF BELMONT; AND AS SHE WAS
NOT REALLY MRS CROFT, SHE MUST LET HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY.
AS SOON AS THEY WERE FAIRLY ASCENDING BELMONT, HE BEGAN--

"WELL, NOW YOU SHALL HEAR SOMETHING THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU.
BUT FIRST OF ALL, YOU MUST TELL ME THE NAME OF THE YOUNG LADY
I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT.  THAT YOUNG LADY, YOU KNOW, THAT WE HAVE
ALL BEEN SO CONCERNED FOR.  THE MISS MUSGROVE, THAT ALL THIS HAS BEEN
HAPPENING TO.  HER CHRISTIAN NAME:  I ALWAYS FORGET HER CHRISTIAN NAME."

ANNE HAD BEEN ASHAMED TO APPEAR TO COMPREHEND SO SOON AS SHE REALLY
DID; BUT NOW SHE COULD SAFELY SUGGEST THE NAME OF "LOUISA."

"AY, AY, MISS LOUISA MUSGROVE, THAT IS THE NAME.  I WISH YOUNG LADIES
HAD NOT SUCH A NUMBER OF FINE CHRISTIAN NAMES.  I SHOULD NEVER BE OUT
IF THEY WERE ALL SOPHYS, OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT.  WELL,
THIS MISS LOUISA, WE ALL THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, WAS TO MARRY FREDERICK.
HE WAS COURTING HER WEEK AFTER WEEK.  THE ONLY WONDER WAS,
WHAT THEY COULD BE WAITING FOR, TILL THE BUSINESS AT LYME CAME;
THEN, INDEED, IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH THAT THEY MUST WAIT TILL HER BRAIN
WAS SET TO RIGHT.  BUT EVEN THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN THEIR
WAY OF GOING ON.  INSTEAD OF STAYING AT LYME, HE WENT OFF TO PLYMOUTH,
AND THEN HE WENT OFF TO SEE EDWARD.  WHEN WE CAME BACK FROM MINEHEAD
HE WAS GONE DOWN TO EDWARD'S, AND THERE HE HAS BEEN EVER SINCE.
WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF HIM SINCE NOVEMBER.  EVEN SOPHY COULD
NOT UNDERSTAND IT.  BUT NOW, THE MATTER HAS TAKE THE STRANGEST TURN OF ALL;
FOR THIS YOUNG LADY, THE SAME MISS MUSGROVE, INSTEAD OF BEING
TO MARRY FREDERICK, IS TO MARRY JAMES BENWICK.  YOU KNOW JAMES BENWICK."

"A LITTLE.  I AM A LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH CAPTAIN BENWICK."

"WELL, SHE IS TO MARRY HIM.  NAY, MOST LIKELY THEY ARE MARRIED ALREADY,
FOR I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD WAIT FOR."

"I THOUGHT CAPTAIN BENWICK A VERY PLEASING YOUNG MAN," SAID ANNE,
"AND I UNDERSTAND THAT HE BEARS AN EXCELLENT CHARACTER."

"OH! YES, YES, THERE IS NOT A WORD TO BE SAID AGAINST JAMES BENWICK.
HE IS ONLY A COMMANDER, IT IS TRUE, MADE LAST SUMMER, AND THESE ARE
BAD TIMES FOR GETTING ON, BUT HE HAS NOT ANOTHER FAULT THAT I KNOW OF.
AN EXCELLENT, GOOD-HEARTED FELLOW, I ASSURE YOU; A VERY ACTIVE,
ZEALOUS OFFICER TOO, WHICH IS MORE THAN YOU WOULD THINK FOR, PERHAPS,
FOR THAT SOFT SORT OF MANNER DOES NOT DO HIM JUSTICE."

"INDEED YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE, SIR; I SHOULD NEVER AUGUR WANT OF SPIRIT
FROM CAPTAIN BENWICK'S MANNERS.  I THOUGHT THEM PARTICULARLY PLEASING,
AND I WILL ANSWER FOR IT, THEY WOULD GENERALLY PLEASE."

"WELL, WELL, LADIES ARE THE BEST JUDGES; BUT JAMES BENWICK IS RATHER TOO
PIANO FOR ME; AND THOUGH VERY LIKELY IT IS ALL OUR PARTIALITY,
SOPHY AND I CANNOT HELP THINKING FREDERICK'S MANNERS BETTER THAN HIS.
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT FREDERICK MORE TO OUR TASTE."

ANNE WAS CAUGHT.  SHE HAD ONLY MEANT TO OPPOSE THE TOO COMMON IDEA
OF SPIRIT AND GENTLENESS BEING INCOMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER,
NOT AT ALL TO REPRESENT CAPTAIN BENWICK'S MANNERS AS THE VERY BEST
THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE; AND, AFTER A LITTLE HESITATION,
SHE WAS BEGINNING TO SAY, "I WAS NOT ENTERING INTO ANY COMPARISON
OF THE TWO FRIENDS," BUT THE ADMIRAL INTERRUPTED HER WITH--

"AND THE THING IS CERTAINLY TRUE.  IT IS NOT A MERE BIT OF GOSSIP.
WE HAVE IT FROM FREDERICK HIMSELF.  HIS SISTER HAD A LETTER
FROM HIM YESTERDAY, IN WHICH HE TELLS US OF IT, AND HE HAD JUST HAD IT
IN A LETTER FROM HARVILLE, WRITTEN UPON THE SPOT, FROM UPPERCROSS.
I FANCY THEY ARE ALL AT UPPERCROSS."

THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH ANNE COULD NOT RESIST; SHE SAID, THEREFORE,
"I HOPE, ADMIRAL, I HOPE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE STYLE OF CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH'S LETTER TO MAKE YOU AND MRS CROFT PARTICULARLY UNEASY.
IT DID SEEM, LAST AUTUMN, AS IF THERE WERE AN ATTACHMENT BETWEEN HIM
AND LOUISA MUSGROVE; BUT I HOPE IT MAY BE UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE WORN OUT
ON EACH SIDE EQUALLY, AND WITHOUT VIOLENCE.  I HOPE HIS LETTER
DOES NOT BREATHE THE SPIRIT OF AN ILL-USED MAN."

"NOT AT ALL, NOT AT ALL; THERE IS NOT AN OATH OR A MURMUR
FROM BEGINNING TO END."

ANNE LOOKED DOWN TO HIDE HER SMILE.

"NO, NO; FREDERICK IS NOT A MAN TO WHINE AND COMPLAIN; HE HAS
TOO MUCH SPIRIT FOR THAT.  IF THE GIRL LIKES ANOTHER MAN BETTER,
IT IS VERY FIT SHE SHOULD HAVE HIM."

"CERTAINLY.  BUT WHAT I MEAN IS, THAT I HOPE THERE IS NOTHING
IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MANNER OF WRITING TO MAKE YOU SUPPOSE
HE THINKS HIMSELF ILL-USED BY HIS FRIEND, WHICH MIGHT APPEAR,
YOU KNOW, WITHOUT ITS BEING ABSOLUTELY SAID.  I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY
THAT SUCH A FRIENDSHIP AS HAS SUBSISTED BETWEEN HIM AND CAPTAIN BENWICK
SHOULD BE DESTROYED, OR EVEN WOUNDED, BY A CIRCUMSTANCE OF THIS SORT."

"YES, YES, I UNDERSTAND YOU.  BUT THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL OF THAT NATURE
IN THE LETTER.  HE DOES NOT GIVE THE LEAST FLING AT BENWICK;
DOES NOT SO MUCH AS SAY, `I WONDER AT IT, I HAVE A REASON OF MY OWN
FOR WONDERING AT IT.'  NO, YOU WOULD NOT GUESS, FROM HIS WAY OF WRITING,
THAT HE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF THIS MISS (WHAT'S HER NAME?) FOR HIMSELF.
HE VERY HANDSOMELY HOPES THEY WILL BE HAPPY TOGETHER; AND THERE IS
NOTHING VERY UNFORGIVING IN THAT, I THINK."

ANNE DID NOT RECEIVE THE PERFECT CONVICTION WHICH THE ADMIRAL MEANT
TO CONVEY, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS TO PRESS THE ENQUIRY FARTHER.
SHE THEREFORE SATISFIED HERSELF WITH COMMON-PLACE REMARKS OR QUIET
ATTENTION, AND THE ADMIRAL HAD IT ALL HIS OWN WAY.

"POOR FREDERICK!" SAID HE AT LAST.  "NOW HE MUST BEGIN ALL OVER AGAIN
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.  I THINK WE MUST GET HIM TO BATH.  SOPHY MUST WRITE,
AND BEG HIM TO COME TO BATH.  HERE ARE PRETTY GIRLS ENOUGH, I AM SURE.
IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO GO TO UPPERCROSS AGAIN, FOR THAT OTHER
MISS MUSGROVE, I FIND, IS BESPOKE BY HER COUSIN, THE YOUNG PARSON.
DO NOT YOU THINK, MISS ELLIOT, WE HAD BETTER TRY TO GET HIM TO BATH?"



CHAPTER 19


WHILE ADMIRAL CROFT WAS TAKING THIS WALK WITH ANNE, AND EXPRESSING
HIS WISH OF GETTING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH TO BATH, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY THITHER.  BEFORE MRS CROFT HAD WRITTEN,
HE WAS ARRIVED, AND THE VERY NEXT TIME ANNE WALKED OUT, SHE SAW HIM.

MR ELLIOT WAS ATTENDING HIS TWO COUSINS AND MRS CLAY.  THEY WERE
IN MILSOM STREET.  IT BEGAN TO RAIN, NOT MUCH, BUT ENOUGH TO
MAKE SHELTER DESIRABLE FOR WOMEN, AND QUITE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT
VERY DESIRABLE FOR MISS ELLIOT TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING
CONVEYED HOME IN LADY DALRYMPLE'S CARRIAGE, WHICH WAS SEEN WAITING
AT A LITTLE DISTANCE; SHE, ANNE, AND MRS CLAY, THEREFORE,
TURNED INTO MOLLAND'S, WHILE MR ELLIOT STEPPED TO LADY DALRYMPLE,
TO REQUEST HER ASSISTANCE.  HE SOON JOINED THEM AGAIN, SUCCESSFUL,
OF COURSE; LADY DALRYMPLE WOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO TAKE THEM HOME,
AND WOULD CALL FOR THEM IN A FEW MINUTES.

HER LADYSHIP'S CARRIAGE WAS A BAROUCHE, AND DID NOT HOLD
MORE THAN FOUR WITH ANY COMFORT.  MISS CARTERET WAS WITH HER MOTHER;
CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS NOT REASONABLE TO EXPECT ACCOMMODATION
FOR ALL THE THREE CAMDEN PLACE LADIES.  THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
AS TO MISS ELLIOT.  WHOEVER SUFFERED INCONVENIENCE, SHE MUST SUFFER NONE,
BUT IT OCCUPIED A LITTLE TIME TO SETTLE THE POINT OF CIVILITY
BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO.  THE RAIN WAS A MERE TRIFLE, AND ANNE WAS
MOST SINCERE IN PREFERRING A WALK WITH MR ELLIOT.  BUT THE RAIN WAS ALSO
A MERE TRIFLE TO MRS CLAY; SHE WOULD HARDLY ALLOW IT EVEN TO DROP AT ALL,
AND HER BOOTS WERE SO THICK! MUCH THICKER THAN MISS ANNE'S;
AND, IN SHORT, HER CIVILITY RENDERED HER QUITE AS ANXIOUS TO BE LEFT
TO WALK WITH MR ELLIOT AS ANNE COULD BE, AND IT WAS DISCUSSED BETWEEN THEM
WITH A GENEROSITY SO POLITE AND SO DETERMINED, THAT THE OTHERS WERE
OBLIGED TO SETTLE IT FOR THEM; MISS ELLIOT MAINTAINING THAT MRS CLAY
HAD A LITTLE COLD ALREADY, AND MR ELLIOT DECIDING ON APPEAL,
THAT HIS COUSIN ANNE'S BOOTS WERE RATHER THE THICKEST.

IT WAS FIXED ACCORDINGLY, THAT MRS CLAY SHOULD BE OF THE PARTY
IN THE CARRIAGE; AND THEY HAD JUST REACHED THIS POINT, WHEN ANNE,
AS SHE SAT NEAR THE WINDOW, DESCRIED, MOST DECIDEDLY AND DISTINCTLY,
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKING DOWN THE STREET.

HER START WAS PERCEPTIBLE ONLY TO HERSELF; BUT SHE INSTANTLY FELT THAT
SHE WAS THE GREATEST SIMPLETON IN THE WORLD, THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE
AND ABSURD!  FOR A FEW MINUTES SHE SAW NOTHING BEFORE HER;
IT WAS ALL CONFUSION.  SHE WAS LOST, AND WHEN SHE HAD SCOLDED
BACK HER SENSES, SHE FOUND THE OTHERS STILL WAITING FOR THE CARRIAGE,
AND MR ELLIOT (ALWAYS OBLIGING) JUST SETTING OFF FOR UNION STREET
ON A COMMISSION OF MRS CLAY'S.

SHE NOW FELT A GREAT INCLINATION TO GO TO THE OUTER DOOR;
SHE WANTED TO SEE IF IT RAINED.  WHY WAS SHE TO SUSPECT HERSELF
OF ANOTHER MOTIVE?  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH MUST BE OUT OF SIGHT.
SHE LEFT HER SEAT, SHE WOULD GO; ONE HALF OF HER SHOULD NOT BE ALWAYS
SO MUCH WISER THAN THE OTHER HALF, OR ALWAYS SUSPECTING THE OTHER
OF BEING WORSE THAN IT WAS.  SHE WOULD SEE IF IT RAINED.
SHE WAS SENT BACK, HOWEVER, IN A MOMENT BY THE ENTRANCE OF
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HIMSELF, AMONG A PARTY OF GENTLEMEN AND LADIES,
EVIDENTLY HIS ACQUAINTANCE, AND WHOM HE MUST HAVE JOINED
A LITTLE BELOW MILSOM STREET.  HE WAS MORE OBVIOUSLY STRUCK
AND CONFUSED BY THE SIGHT OF HER THAN SHE HAD EVER OBSERVED BEFORE;
HE LOOKED QUITE RED.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, SINCE THEIR RENEWED ACQUAINTANCE,
SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS BETRAYING THE LEAST SENSIBILITY OF THE TWO.
SHE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HIM IN THE PREPARATION OF THE LAST FEW MOMENTS.
ALL THE OVERPOWERING, BLINDING, BEWILDERING, FIRST EFFECTS
OF STRONG SURPRISE WERE OVER WITH HER.  STILL, HOWEVER,
SHE HAD ENOUGH TO FEEL!  IT WAS AGITATION, PAIN, PLEASURE,
A SOMETHING BETWEEN DELIGHT AND MISERY.

HE SPOKE TO HER, AND THEN TURNED AWAY.  THE CHARACTER OF HIS MANNER
WAS EMBARRASSMENT.  SHE COULD NOT HAVE CALLED IT EITHER COLD OR FRIENDLY,
OR ANYTHING SO CERTAINLY AS EMBARRASSED.

AFTER A SHORT INTERVAL, HOWEVER, HE CAME TOWARDS HER, AND SPOKE AGAIN.
MUTUAL ENQUIRIES ON COMMON SUBJECTS PASSED:  NEITHER OF THEM, PROBABLY,
MUCH THE WISER FOR WHAT THEY HEARD, AND ANNE CONTINUING FULLY SENSIBLE
OF HIS BEING LESS AT EASE THAN FORMERLY.  THEY HAD BY DINT OF BEING
SO VERY MUCH TOGETHER, GOT TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER WITH A CONSIDERABLE
PORTION OF APPARENT INDIFFERENCE AND CALMNESS; BUT HE COULD NOT DO IT NOW.
TIME HAD CHANGED HIM, OR LOUISA HAD CHANGED HIM.  THERE WAS CONSCIOUSNESS
OF SOME SORT OR OTHER.  HE LOOKED VERY WELL, NOT AS IF HE HAD BEEN
SUFFERING IN HEALTH OR SPIRITS, AND HE TALKED OF UPPERCROSS,
OF THE MUSGROVES, NAY, EVEN OF LOUISA, AND HAD EVEN A MOMENTARY LOOK
OF HIS OWN ARCH SIGNIFICANCE AS HE NAMED HER; BUT YET IT WAS
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NOT COMFORTABLE, NOT EASY, NOT ABLE TO FEIGN THAT HE WAS.

IT DID NOT SURPRISE, BUT IT GRIEVED ANNE TO OBSERVE THAT ELIZABETH
WOULD NOT KNOW HIM.  SHE SAW THAT HE SAW ELIZABETH, THAT ELIZABETH SAW HIM,
THAT THERE WAS COMPLETE INTERNAL RECOGNITION ON EACH SIDE;
SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS READY TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN ACQUAINTANCE,
EXPECTING IT, AND SHE HAD THE PAIN OF SEEING HER SISTER TURN AWAY
WITH UNALTERABLE COLDNESS.

LADY DALRYMPLE'S CARRIAGE, FOR WHICH MISS ELLIOT WAS GROWING
VERY IMPATIENT, NOW DREW UP; THE SERVANT CAME IN TO ANNOUNCE IT.
IT WAS BEGINNING TO RAIN AGAIN, AND ALTOGETHER THERE WAS A DELAY,
AND A BUSTLE, AND A TALKING, WHICH MUST MAKE ALL THE LITTLE CROWD
IN THE SHOP UNDERSTAND THAT LADY DALRYMPLE WAS CALLING TO CONVEY
MISS ELLIOT.  AT LAST MISS ELLIOT AND HER FRIEND, UNATTENDED BUT
BY THE SERVANT, (FOR THERE WAS NO COUSIN RETURNED), WERE WALKING OFF;
AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WATCHING THEM, TURNED AGAIN TO ANNE,
AND BY MANNER, RATHER THAN WORDS, WAS OFFERING HIS SERVICES TO HER.

"I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU," WAS HER ANSWER, "BUT I AM NOT GOING WITH THEM.
THE CARRIAGE WOULD NOT ACCOMMODATE SO MANY.  I WALK:  I PREFER WALKING."

"BUT IT RAINS."

"OH! VERY LITTLE,  NOTHING THAT I REGARD."

AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE HE SAID:  "THOUGH I CAME ONLY YESTERDAY,
I HAVE EQUIPPED MYSELF PROPERLY FOR BATH ALREADY, YOU SEE,"
(POINTING TO A NEW UMBRELLA); "I WISH YOU WOULD MAKE USE OF IT,
IF YOU ARE DETERMINED TO WALK; THOUGH I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT
TO LET ME GET YOU A CHAIR."

SHE WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM, BUT DECLINED IT ALL, REPEATING
HER CONVICTION, THAT THE RAIN WOULD COME TO NOTHING AT PRESENT,
AND ADDING, "I AM ONLY WAITING FOR MR ELLIOT.  HE WILL BE HERE IN A MOMENT,
I AM SURE."

SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN THE WORDS WHEN MR ELLIOT WALKED IN.
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH RECOLLECTED HIM PERFECTLY.  THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN HIM AND THE MAN WHO HAD STOOD ON THE STEPS AT LYME,
ADMIRING ANNE AS SHE PASSED, EXCEPT IN THE AIR AND LOOK AND MANNER
OF THE PRIVILEGED RELATION AND FRIEND.  HE CAME IN WITH EAGERNESS,
APPEARED TO SEE AND THINK ONLY OF HER, APOLOGISED FOR HIS STAY,
WAS GRIEVED TO HAVE KEPT HER WAITING, AND ANXIOUS TO GET HER AWAY
WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF TIME AND BEFORE THE RAIN INCREASED;
AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT THEY WALKED OFF TOGETHER, HER ARM UNDER HIS,
A GENTLE AND EMBARRASSED GLANCE, AND A "GOOD MORNING TO YOU!"
BEING ALL THAT SHE HAD TIME FOR, AS SHE PASSED AWAY.

AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT, THE LADIES OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S PARTY
BEGAN TALKING OF THEM.

"MR ELLIOT DOES NOT DISLIKE HIS COUSIN, I FANCY?"

"OH! NO, THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH.  ONE CAN GUESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE.
HE IS ALWAYS WITH THEM; HALF LIVES IN THE FAMILY, I BELIEVE.
WHAT A VERY GOOD-LOOKING MAN!"

"YES, AND MISS ATKINSON, WHO DINED WITH HIM ONCE AT THE WALLISES,
SAYS HE IS THE MOST AGREEABLE MAN SHE EVER WAS IN COMPANY WITH."

"SHE IS PRETTY, I THINK; ANNE ELLIOT; VERY PRETTY, WHEN ONE COMES
TO LOOK AT HER.  IT IS NOT THE FASHION TO SAY SO, BUT I CONFESS
I ADMIRE HER MORE THAN HER SISTER."

"OH! SO DO I."

"AND SO DO I.  NO COMPARISON.  BUT THE MEN ARE ALL WILD AFTER MISS ELLIOT.
ANNE IS TOO DELICATE FOR THEM."

ANNE WOULD HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY OBLIGED TO HER COUSIN, IF HE WOULD HAVE
WALKED BY HER SIDE ALL THE WAY TO CAMDEN PLACE, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD.
SHE HAD NEVER FOUND IT SO DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO HIM, THOUGH NOTHING
COULD EXCEED HIS SOLICITUDE AND CARE, AND THOUGH HIS SUBJECTS
WERE PRINCIPALLY SUCH AS WERE WONT TO BE ALWAYS INTERESTING:
PRAISE, WARM, JUST, AND DISCRIMINATING, OF LADY RUSSELL,
AND INSINUATIONS HIGHLY RATIONAL AGAINST MRS CLAY.  BUT JUST NOW
SHE COULD THINK ONLY OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
HIS PRESENT FEELINGS, WHETHER HE WERE REALLY SUFFERING MUCH
FROM DISAPPOINTMENT OR NOT; AND TILL THAT POINT WERE SETTLED,
SHE COULD NOT BE QUITE HERSELF.

SHE HOPED TO BE WISE AND REASONABLE IN TIME; BUT ALAS! ALAS!
SHE MUST CONFESS TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WISE YET.

ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE VERY ESSENTIAL FOR HER TO KNOW, WAS HOW LONG
HE MEANT TO BE IN BATH; HE HAD NOT MENTIONED IT, OR SHE COULD NOT
RECOLLECT IT.  HE MIGHT BE ONLY PASSING THROUGH.  BUT IT WAS MORE PROBABLE
THAT HE SHOULD BE COME TO STAY.  IN THAT CASE, SO LIABLE AS EVERY BODY WAS
TO MEET EVERY BODY IN BATH, LADY RUSSELL WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
SEE HIM SOMEWHERE.  WOULD SHE RECOLLECT HIM?  HOW WOULD IT ALL BE?

SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN OBLIGED TO TELL LADY RUSSELL THAT LOUISA MUSGROVE
WAS TO MARRY CAPTAIN BENWICK.  IT HAD COST HER SOMETHING TO ENCOUNTER
LADY RUSSELL'S SURPRISE; AND NOW, IF SHE WERE BY ANY CHANCE
TO BE THROWN INTO COMPANY WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, HER IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE
OF THE MATTER MIGHT ADD ANOTHER SHADE OF PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM.

THE FOLLOWING MORNING ANNE WAS OUT WITH HER FRIEND, AND FOR THE FIRST HOUR,
IN AN INCESSANT AND FEARFUL SORT OF WATCH FOR HIM IN VAIN; BUT AT LAST,
IN RETURNING DOWN PULTENEY STREET, SHE DISTINGUISHED HIM
ON THE RIGHT HAND PAVEMENT AT SUCH A DISTANCE AS TO HAVE HIM IN VIEW
THE GREATER PART OF THE STREET.  THERE WERE MANY OTHER MEN ABOUT HIM,
MANY GROUPS WALKING THE SAME WAY, BUT THERE WAS NO MISTAKING HIM.
SHE LOOKED INSTINCTIVELY AT LADY RUSSELL; BUT NOT FROM ANY MAD IDEA
OF HER RECOGNISING HIM SO SOON AS SHE DID HERSELF.  NO, IT WAS
NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT LADY RUSSELL WOULD PERCEIVE HIM TILL THEY
WERE NEARLY OPPOSITE.  SHE LOOKED AT HER HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME,
ANXIOUSLY; AND WHEN THE MOMENT APPROACHED WHICH MUST POINT HIM OUT,
THOUGH NOT DARING TO LOOK AGAIN (FOR HER OWN COUNTENANCE SHE KNEW
WAS UNFIT TO BE SEEN), SHE WAS YET PERFECTLY CONSCIOUS OF
LADY RUSSELL'S EYES BEING TURNED EXACTLY IN THE DIRECTION FOR HIM--
OF HER BEING, IN SHORT, INTENTLY OBSERVING HIM.  SHE COULD THOROUGHLY
COMPREHEND THE SORT OF FASCINATION HE MUST POSSESS OVER LADY RUSSELL'S MIND,
THE DIFFICULTY IT MUST BE FOR HER TO WITHDRAW HER EYES, THE ASTONISHMENT
SHE MUST BE FEELING THAT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS SHOULD HAVE PASSED OVER HIM,
AND IN FOREIGN CLIMES AND IN ACTIVE SERVICE TOO, WITHOUT ROBBING HIM
OF ONE PERSONAL GRACE!

AT LAST, LADY RUSSELL DREW BACK HER HEAD.  "NOW, HOW WOULD SHE
SPEAK OF HIM?"

"YOU WILL WONDER," SAID SHE, "WHAT HAS BEEN FIXING MY EYE SO LONG;
BUT I WAS LOOKING AFTER SOME WINDOW-CURTAINS, WHICH LADY ALICIA AND
MRS FRANKLAND WERE TELLING ME OF LAST NIGHT.  THEY DESCRIBED
THE DRAWING-ROOM WINDOW-CURTAINS OF ONE OF THE HOUSES ON THIS
SIDE OF THE WAY, AND THIS PART OF THE STREET, AS BEING THE HANDSOMEST
AND BEST HUNG OF ANY IN BATH, BUT COULD NOT RECOLLECT THE EXACT NUMBER,
AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH IT COULD BE; BUT I CONFESS
I CAN SEE NO CURTAINS HEREABOUTS THAT ANSWER THEIR DESCRIPTION."

ANNE SIGHED AND BLUSHED AND SMILED, IN PITY AND DISDAIN,
EITHER AT HER FRIEND OR HERSELF.  THE PART WHICH PROVOKED HER MOST,
WAS THAT IN ALL THIS WASTE OF FORESIGHT AND CAUTION, SHE SHOULD HAVE
LOST THE RIGHT MOMENT FOR SEEING WHETHER HE SAW THEM.

A DAY OR TWO PASSED WITHOUT PRODUCING ANYTHING.  THE THEATRE OR THE ROOMS,
WHERE HE WAS MOST LIKELY TO BE, WERE NOT FASHIONABLE ENOUGH
FOR THE ELLIOTS, WHOSE EVENING AMUSEMENTS WERE SOLELY IN THE
ELEGANT STUPIDITY OF PRIVATE PARTIES, IN WHICH THEY WERE GETTING
MORE AND MORE ENGAGED; AND ANNE, WEARIED OF SUCH A STATE OF STAGNATION,
SICK OF KNOWING NOTHING, AND FANCYING HERSELF STRONGER BECAUSE
HER STRENGTH WAS NOT TRIED, WAS QUITE IMPATIENT FOR THE CONCERT EVENING.
IT WAS A CONCERT FOR THE BENEFIT OF A PERSON PATRONISED BY LADY DALRYMPLE.
OF COURSE THEY MUST ATTEND.  IT WAS REALLY EXPECTED TO BE A GOOD ONE,
AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS VERY FOND OF MUSIC.  IF SHE COULD ONLY HAVE
A FEW MINUTES CONVERSATION WITH HIM AGAIN, SHE FANCIED SHE SHOULD
BE SATISFIED; AND AS TO THE POWER OF ADDRESSING HIM, SHE FELT ALL OVER
COURAGE IF THE OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED.  ELIZABETH HAD TURNED FROM HIM,
LADY RUSSELL OVERLOOKED HIM; HER NERVES WERE STRENGTHENED
BY THESE CIRCUMSTANCES; SHE FELT THAT SHE OWED HIM ATTENTION.

SHE HAD ONCE PARTLY PROMISED MRS SMITH TO SPEND THE EVENING WITH HER;
BUT IN A SHORT HURRIED CALL SHE EXCUSED HERSELF AND PUT IT OFF,
WITH THE MORE DECIDED PROMISE OF A LONGER VISIT ON THE MORROW.
MRS SMITH GAVE A MOST GOOD-HUMOURED ACQUIESCENCE.

"BY ALL MEANS," SAID SHE; "ONLY TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT, WHEN YOU DO COME.
WHO IS YOUR PARTY?"

ANNE NAMED THEM ALL.  MRS SMITH MADE NO REPLY; BUT WHEN SHE WAS
LEAVING HER SAID, AND WITH AN EXPRESSION HALF SERIOUS, HALF ARCH,
"WELL, I HEARTILY WISH YOUR CONCERT MAY ANSWER; AND DO NOT FAIL ME
TO-MORROW IF YOU CAN COME; FOR I BEGIN TO HAVE A FOREBODING
THAT I MAY NOT HAVE MANY MORE VISITS FROM YOU."

ANNE WAS STARTLED AND CONFUSED; BUT AFTER STANDING IN A MOMENT'S SUSPENSE,
WAS OBLIGED, AND NOT SORRY TO BE OBLIGED, TO HURRY AWAY.



CHAPTER 20


SIR WALTER, HIS TWO DAUGHTERS, AND MRS CLAY, WERE THE EARLIEST
OF ALL THEIR PARTY AT THE ROOMS IN THE EVENING; AND AS LADY DALRYMPLE
MUST BE WAITED FOR, THEY TOOK THEIR STATION BY ONE OF THE FIRES
IN THE OCTAGON ROOM.  BUT HARDLY WERE THEY SO SETTLED, WHEN THE DOOR
OPENED AGAIN, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKED IN ALONE.  ANNE WAS
THE NEAREST TO HIM, AND MAKING YET A LITTLE ADVANCE, SHE INSTANTLY SPOKE.
HE WAS PREPARING ONLY TO BOW AND PASS ON, BUT HER GENTLE "HOW DO YOU DO?"
BROUGHT HIM OUT OF THE STRAIGHT LINE TO STAND NEAR HER, AND MAKE ENQUIRIES
IN RETURN, IN SPITE OF THE FORMIDABLE FATHER AND SISTER IN THE BACK GROUND.
THEIR BEING IN THE BACK GROUND WAS A SUPPORT TO ANNE; SHE KNEW NOTHING
OF THEIR LOOKS, AND FELT EQUAL TO EVERYTHING WHICH SHE BELIEVED
RIGHT TO BE DONE.

WHILE THEY WERE SPEAKING, A WHISPERING BETWEEN HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH
CAUGHT HER EAR.  SHE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH, BUT SHE MUST GUESS THE SUBJECT;
AND ON CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MAKING A DISTANT BOW, SHE COMPREHENDED
THAT HER FATHER HAD JUDGED SO WELL AS TO GIVE HIM THAT
SIMPLE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ACQUAINTANCE, AND SHE WAS JUST IN TIME
BY A SIDE GLANCE TO SEE A SLIGHT CURTSEY FROM ELIZABETH HERSELF.
THIS, THOUGH LATE, AND RELUCTANT, AND UNGRACIOUS, WAS YET
BETTER THAN NOTHING, AND HER SPIRITS IMPROVED.

AFTER TALKING, HOWEVER, OF THE WEATHER, AND BATH, AND THE CONCERT,
THEIR CONVERSATION BEGAN TO FLAG, AND SO LITTLE WAS SAID AT LAST,
THAT SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM TO GO EVERY MOMENT, BUT HE DID NOT;
HE SEEMED IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE HER; AND PRESENTLY WITH RENEWED SPIRIT,
WITH A LITTLE SMILE, A LITTLE GLOW, HE SAID--

"I HAVE HARDLY SEEN YOU SINCE OUR DAY AT LYME.  I AM AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE
SUFFERED FROM THE SHOCK, AND THE MORE FROM ITS NOT OVERPOWERING YOU
AT THE TIME."

SHE ASSURED HIM THAT SHE HAD NOT.

"IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL HOUR," SAID HE, "A FRIGHTFUL DAY!" AND HE
PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES, AS IF THE REMEMBRANCE WERE STILL
TOO PAINFUL, BUT IN A MOMENT, HALF SMILING AGAIN, ADDED,
"THE DAY HAS PRODUCED SOME EFFECTS HOWEVER; HAS HAD SOME CONSEQUENCES
WHICH MUST BE CONSIDERED AS THE VERY REVERSE OF FRIGHTFUL.
WHEN YOU HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO SUGGEST THAT BENWICK WOULD BE
THE PROPEREST PERSON TO FETCH A SURGEON, YOU COULD HAVE LITTLE IDEA
OF HIS BEING EVENTUALLY ONE OF THOSE MOST CONCERNED IN HER RECOVERY."

"CERTAINLY I COULD HAVE NONE.  BUT IT APPEARS--I SHOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE
A VERY HAPPY MATCH.  THERE ARE ON BOTH SIDES GOOD PRINCIPLES
AND GOOD TEMPER."

"YES," SAID HE, LOOKING NOT EXACTLY FORWARD; "BUT THERE, I THINK,
ENDS THE RESEMBLANCE.  WITH ALL MY SOUL I WISH THEM HAPPY, AND REJOICE
OVER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOUR OF IT.  THEY HAVE NO DIFFICULTIES
TO CONTEND WITH AT HOME, NO OPPOSITION, NO CAPRICE, NO DELAYS.
THE MUSGROVES ARE BEHAVING LIKE THEMSELVES, MOST HONOURABLY AND KINDLY,
ONLY ANXIOUS WITH TRUE PARENTAL HEARTS TO PROMOTE THEIR DAUGHTER'S COMFORT.
ALL THIS IS MUCH, VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF THEIR HAPPINESS;
MORE THAN PERHAPS--"

HE STOPPED.  A SUDDEN RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO OCCUR, AND TO GIVE HIM
SOME TASTE OF THAT EMOTION WHICH WAS REDDENING ANNE'S CHEEKS
AND FIXING HER EYES ON THE GROUND.  AFTER CLEARING HIS THROAT, HOWEVER,
HE PROCEEDED THUS--

"I CONFESS THAT I DO THINK THERE IS A DISPARITY, TOO GREAT A DISPARITY,
AND IN A POINT NO LESS ESSENTIAL THAN MIND.  I REGARD LOUISA MUSGROVE
AS A VERY AMIABLE, SWEET-TEMPERED GIRL, AND NOT DEFICIENT IN UNDERSTANDING,
BUT BENWICK IS SOMETHING MORE.  HE IS A CLEVER MAN, A READING MAN;
AND I CONFESS, THAT I DO CONSIDER HIS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO HER
WITH SOME SURPRISE.  HAD IT BEEN THE EFFECT OF GRATITUDE,
HAD HE LEARNT TO LOVE HER, BECAUSE HE BELIEVED HER TO BE PREFERRING HIM,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER THING.  BUT I HAVE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE IT SO.
IT SEEMS, ON THE CONTRARY, TO HAVE BEEN A PERFECTLY SPONTANEOUS,
UNTAUGHT FEELING ON HIS SIDE, AND THIS SURPRISES ME.  A MAN LIKE HIM,
IN HIS SITUATION! WITH A HEART PIERCED, WOUNDED, ALMOST BROKEN!
FANNY HARVILLE WAS A VERY SUPERIOR CREATURE, AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER
WAS INDEED ATTACHMENT.  A MAN DOES NOT RECOVER FROM SUCH
A DEVOTION OF THE HEART TO SUCH A WOMAN.  HE OUGHT NOT; HE DOES NOT."

EITHER FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS, HOWEVER, THAT HIS FRIEND HAD RECOVERED,
OR FROM OTHER CONSCIOUSNESS, HE WENT NO FARTHER; AND ANNE WHO,
IN SPITE OF THE AGITATED VOICE IN WHICH THE LATTER PART HAD BEEN UTTERED,
AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE VARIOUS NOISES OF THE ROOM, THE ALMOST CEASELESS
SLAM OF THE DOOR, AND CEASELESS BUZZ OF PERSONS WALKING THROUGH,
HAD DISTINGUISHED EVERY WORD, WAS STRUCK, GRATIFIED, CONFUSED,
AND BEGINNING TO BREATHE VERY QUICK, AND FEEL AN HUNDRED THINGS
IN A MOMENT.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO ENTER ON SUCH A SUBJECT;
AND YET, AFTER A PAUSE, FEELING THE NECESSITY OF SPEAKING,
AND HAVING NOT THE SMALLEST WISH FOR A TOTAL CHANGE, SHE ONLY DEVIATED
SO FAR AS TO SAY--

"YOU WERE A GOOD WHILE AT LYME, I THINK?"

"ABOUT A FORTNIGHT.  I COULD NOT LEAVE IT TILL LOUISA'S DOING WELL
WAS QUITE ASCERTAINED.  I HAD BEEN TOO DEEPLY CONCERNED IN THE MISCHIEF
TO BE SOON AT PEACE.  IT HAD BEEN MY DOING, SOLELY MINE.
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OBSTINATE IF I HAD NOT BEEN WEAK.
THE COUNTRY ROUND LYME IS VERY FINE.  I WALKED AND RODE A GREAT DEAL;
AND THE MORE I SAW, THE MORE I FOUND TO ADMIRE."

"I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE LYME AGAIN," SAID ANNE.

"INDEED!  I SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT YOU COULD HAVE FOUND
ANYTHING IN LYME TO INSPIRE SUCH A FEELING.  THE HORROR AND DISTRESS
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN, THE STRETCH OF MIND, THE WEAR OF SPIRITS!
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOUR LAST IMPRESSIONS OF LYME MUST HAVE BEEN
STRONG DISGUST."

"THE LAST HOURS WERE CERTAINLY VERY PAINFUL," REPLIED ANNE;
"BUT WHEN PAIN IS OVER, THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT OFTEN BECOMES A PLEASURE.
ONE DOES NOT LOVE A PLACE THE LESS FOR HAVING SUFFERED IN IT,
UNLESS IT HAS BEEN ALL SUFFERING, NOTHING BUT SUFFERING, WHICH WAS
BY NO MEANS THE CASE AT LYME.  WE WERE ONLY IN ANXIETY AND DISTRESS
DURING THE LAST TWO HOURS, AND PREVIOUSLY THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL
OF ENJOYMENT.  SO MUCH NOVELTY AND BEAUTY! I HAVE TRAVELLED SO LITTLE,
THAT EVERY FRESH PLACE WOULD BE INTERESTING TO ME; BUT THERE IS REAL BEAUTY
AT LYME; AND IN SHORT" (WITH A FAINT BLUSH AT SOME RECOLLECTIONS),
"ALTOGETHER MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE PLACE ARE VERY AGREEABLE."

AS SHE CEASED, THE ENTRANCE DOOR OPENED AGAIN, AND THE VERY PARTY APPEARED
FOR WHOM THEY WERE WAITING.  "LADY DALRYMPLE, LADY DALRYMPLE,"
WAS THE REJOICING SOUND; AND WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS COMPATIBLE
WITH ANXIOUS ELEGANCE, SIR WALTER AND HIS TWO LADIES STEPPED FORWARD
TO MEET HER.  LADY DALRYMPLE AND MISS CARTERET, ESCORTED BY MR ELLIOT
AND COLONEL WALLIS, WHO HAD HAPPENED TO ARRIVE NEARLY AT THE SAME INSTANT,
ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM.  THE OTHERS JOINED THEM, AND IT WAS
A GROUP IN WHICH ANNE FOUND HERSELF ALSO NECESSARILY INCLUDED.
SHE WAS DIVIDED FROM CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  THEIR INTERESTING,
ALMOST TOO INTERESTING CONVERSATION MUST BE BROKEN UP FOR A TIME,
BUT SLIGHT WAS THE PENANCE COMPARED WITH THE HAPPINESS WHICH BROUGHT IT ON!
SHE HAD LEARNT, IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES, MORE OF HIS FEELINGS
TOWARDS LOUISA, MORE OF ALL HIS FEELINGS THAN SHE DARED TO THINK OF;
AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE DEMANDS OF THE PARTY, TO THE NEEDFUL
CIVILITIES OF THE MOMENT, WITH EXQUISITE, THOUGH AGITATED SENSATIONS.
SHE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH ALL.  SHE HAD RECEIVED IDEAS WHICH
DISPOSED HER TO BE COURTEOUS AND KIND TO ALL, AND TO PITY EVERY ONE,
AS BEING LESS HAPPY THAN HERSELF.

THE DELIGHTFUL EMOTIONS WERE A LITTLE SUBDUED, WHEN ON STEPPING BACK
FROM THE GROUP, TO BE JOINED AGAIN BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, SHE SAW
THAT HE WAS GONE.  SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE HIM TURN INTO
THE CONCERT ROOM.  HE WAS GONE; HE HAD DISAPPEARED, SHE FELT
A MOMENT'S REGRET.  BUT "THEY SHOULD MEET AGAIN.  HE WOULD LOOK FOR HER,
HE WOULD FIND HER OUT BEFORE THE EVENING WERE OVER, AND AT PRESENT,
PERHAPS, IT WAS AS WELL TO BE ASUNDER.  SHE WAS IN NEED OF
A LITTLE INTERVAL FOR RECOLLECTION."

UPON LADY RUSSELL'S APPEARANCE SOON AFTERWARDS, THE WHOLE PARTY
WAS COLLECTED, AND ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO MARSHAL THEMSELVES,
AND PROCEED INTO THE CONCERT ROOM; AND BE OF ALL THE CONSEQUENCE
IN THEIR POWER, DRAW AS MANY EYES, EXCITE AS MANY WHISPERS,
AND DISTURB AS MANY PEOPLE AS THEY COULD.

VERY, VERY HAPPY WERE BOTH ELIZABETH AND ANNE ELLIOT AS THEY WALKED IN.
ELIZABETH ARM IN ARM WITH MISS CARTERET, AND LOOKING ON THE BROAD BACK
OF THE DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS DALRYMPLE BEFORE HER, HAD NOTHING TO WISH FOR
WHICH DID NOT SEEM WITHIN HER REACH; AND ANNE--BUT IT WOULD BE
AN INSULT TO THE NATURE OF ANNE'S FELICITY, TO DRAW ANY COMPARISON
BETWEEN IT AND HER SISTER'S; THE ORIGIN OF ONE ALL SELFISH VANITY,
OF THE OTHER ALL GENEROUS ATTACHMENT.

ANNE SAW NOTHING, THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE BRILLIANCY OF THE ROOM.
HER HAPPINESS WAS FROM WITHIN.  HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND HER CHEEKS GLOWED;
BUT SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.  SHE WAS THINKING ONLY OF
THE LAST HALF HOUR, AND AS THEY PASSED TO THEIR SEATS, HER MIND TOOK
A HASTY RANGE OVER IT.  HIS CHOICE OF SUBJECTS, HIS EXPRESSIONS,
AND STILL MORE HIS MANNER AND LOOK, HAD BEEN SUCH AS SHE COULD SEE
IN ONLY ONE LIGHT.  HIS OPINION OF LOUISA MUSGROVE'S INFERIORITY,
AN OPINION WHICH HE HAD SEEMED SOLICITOUS TO GIVE, HIS WONDER
AT CAPTAIN BENWICK, HIS FEELINGS AS TO A FIRST, STRONG ATTACHMENT;
SENTENCES BEGUN WHICH HE COULD NOT FINISH, HIS HALF AVERTED EYES
AND MORE THAN HALF EXPRESSIVE GLANCE, ALL, ALL DECLARED THAT HE HAD
A HEART RETURNING TO HER AT LEAST; THAT ANGER, RESENTMENT, AVOIDANCE,
WERE NO MORE; AND THAT THEY WERE SUCCEEDED, NOT MERELY BY FRIENDSHIP
AND REGARD, BUT BY THE TENDERNESS OF THE PAST.  YES, SOME SHARE OF
THE TENDERNESS OF THE PAST.  SHE COULD NOT CONTEMPLATE THE CHANGE
AS IMPLYING LESS.  HE MUST LOVE HER.

THESE WERE THOUGHTS, WITH THEIR ATTENDANT VISIONS, WHICH OCCUPIED
AND FLURRIED HER TOO MUCH TO LEAVE HER ANY POWER OF OBSERVATION;
AND SHE PASSED ALONG THE ROOM WITHOUT HAVING A GLIMPSE OF HIM,
WITHOUT EVEN TRYING TO DISCERN HIM.  WHEN THEIR PLACES WERE DETERMINED ON,
AND THEY WERE ALL PROPERLY ARRANGED, SHE LOOKED ROUND TO SEE
IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE IN THE SAME PART OF THE ROOM, BUT HE WAS NOT;
HER EYE COULD NOT REACH HIM; AND THE CONCERT BEING JUST OPENING,
SHE MUST CONSENT FOR A TIME TO BE HAPPY IN A HUMBLER WAY.

THE PARTY WAS DIVIDED AND DISPOSED OF ON TWO CONTIGUOUS BENCHES:
ANNE WAS AMONG THOSE ON THE FOREMOST, AND MR ELLIOT HAD MANOEUVRED SO WELL,
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS FRIEND COLONEL WALLIS, AS TO HAVE A SEAT BY HER.
MISS ELLIOT, SURROUNDED BY HER COUSINS, AND THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT
OF COLONEL WALLIS'S GALLANTRY, WAS QUITE CONTENTED.

ANNE'S MIND WAS IN A MOST FAVOURABLE STATE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT
OF THE EVENING; IT WAS JUST OCCUPATION ENOUGH:  SHE HAD FEELINGS FOR
THE TENDER, SPIRITS FOR THE GAY, ATTENTION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC,
AND PATIENCE FOR THE WEARISOME; AND HAD NEVER LIKED A CONCERT BETTER,
AT LEAST DURING THE FIRST ACT.  TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF IT,
IN THE INTERVAL SUCCEEDING AN ITALIAN SONG, SHE EXPLAINED
THE WORDS OF THE SONG TO MR ELLIOT.  THEY HAD A CONCERT BILL BETWEEN THEM.

"THIS," SAID SHE, "IS NEARLY THE SENSE, OR RATHER THE MEANING OF THE WORDS,
FOR CERTAINLY THE SENSE OF AN ITALIAN LOVE-SONG MUST NOT BE TALKED OF,
BUT IT IS AS NEARLY THE MEANING AS I CAN GIVE; FOR I DO NOT PRETEND
TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE.  I AM A VERY POOR ITALIAN SCHOLAR."

"YES, YES, I SEE YOU ARE.  I SEE YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER.
YOU HAVE ONLY KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH OF THE LANGUAGE TO TRANSLATE AT SIGHT
THESE INVERTED, TRANSPOSED, CURTAILED ITALIAN LINES, INTO CLEAR,
COMPREHENSIBLE, ELEGANT ENGLISH.  YOU NEED NOT SAY ANYTHING MORE
OF YOUR IGNORANCE.  HERE IS COMPLETE PROOF."

"I WILL NOT OPPOSE SUCH KIND POLITENESS; BUT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO BE
EXAMINED BY A REAL PROFICIENT."

"I HAVE NOT HAD THE PLEASURE OF VISITING IN CAMDEN PLACE SO LONG,"
REPLIED HE, "WITHOUT KNOWING SOMETHING OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT;
AND I DO REGARD HER AS ONE WHO IS TOO MODEST FOR THE WORLD IN GENERAL
TO BE AWARE OF HALF HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND TOO HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED
FOR MODESTY TO BE NATURAL IN ANY OTHER WOMAN."

"FOR SHAME! FOR SHAME! THIS IS TOO MUCH FLATTERY.  I FORGET WHAT WE ARE
TO HAVE NEXT," TURNING TO THE BILL.

"PERHAPS," SAID MR ELLIOT, SPEAKING LOW, "I HAVE HAD A LONGER ACQUAINTANCE
WITH YOUR CHARACTER THAN YOU ARE AWARE OF."

"INDEED!  HOW SO?  YOU CAN HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH IT ONLY SINCE
I CAME TO BATH, EXCEPTING AS YOU MIGHT HEAR ME PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN OF
IN MY OWN FAMILY."

"I KNEW YOU BY REPORT LONG BEFORE YOU CAME TO BATH.  I HAD HEARD YOU
DESCRIBED BY THOSE WHO KNEW YOU INTIMATELY.  I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED
WITH YOU BY CHARACTER MANY YEARS.  YOUR PERSON, YOUR DISPOSITION,
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, MANNER; THEY WERE ALL PRESENT TO ME."

MR ELLIOT WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST HE HOPED TO RAISE.
NO ONE CAN WITHSTAND THE CHARM OF SUCH A MYSTERY.  TO HAVE BEEN
DESCRIBED LONG AGO TO A RECENT ACQUAINTANCE, BY NAMELESS PEOPLE,
IS IRRESISTIBLE; AND ANNE WAS ALL CURIOSITY.  SHE WONDERED,
AND QUESTIONED HIM EAGERLY; BUT IN VAIN.  HE DELIGHTED IN BEING ASKED,
BUT HE WOULD NOT TELL.

"NO, NO, SOME TIME OR OTHER, PERHAPS, BUT NOT NOW.  HE WOULD MENTION
NO NAMES NOW; BUT SUCH, HE COULD ASSURE HER, HAD BEEN THE FACT.
HE HAD MANY YEARS AGO RECEIVED SUCH A DESCRIPTION OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT
AS HAD INSPIRED HIM WITH THE HIGHEST IDEA OF HER MERIT, AND EXCITED
THE WARMEST CURIOSITY TO KNOW HER."

ANNE COULD THINK OF NO ONE SO LIKELY TO HAVE SPOKEN WITH
PARTIALITY OF HER MANY YEARS AGO AS THE MR WENTWORTH OF MONKFORD,
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S BROTHER.  HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN MR ELLIOT'S COMPANY,
BUT SHE HAD NOT COURAGE TO ASK THE QUESTION.

"THE NAME OF ANNE ELLIOT," SAID HE, "HAS LONG HAD AN INTERESTING SOUND TO ME.
VERY LONG HAS IT POSSESSED A CHARM OVER MY FANCY; AND, IF I DARED,
I WOULD BREATHE MY WISHES THAT THE NAME MIGHT NEVER CHANGE."

SUCH, SHE BELIEVED, WERE HIS WORDS; BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE
RECEIVED THEIR SOUND, THAN HER ATTENTION WAS CAUGHT BY OTHER SOUNDS
IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER, WHICH RENDERED EVERY THING ELSE TRIVIAL.
HER FATHER AND LADY DALRYMPLE WERE SPEAKING.

"A WELL-LOOKING MAN," SAID SIR WALTER, "A VERY WELL-LOOKING MAN."

"A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN INDEED!" SAID LADY DALRYMPLE.  "MORE AIR
THAN ONE OFTEN SEES IN BATH.  IRISH, I DARE SAY."

"NO, I JUST KNOW HIS NAME.  A BOWING ACQUAINTANCE.  WENTWORTH;
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OF THE NAVY.  HIS SISTER MARRIED MY TENANT
IN SOMERSETSHIRE, THE CROFT, WHO RENTS KELLYNCH."

BEFORE SIR WALTER HAD REACHED THIS POINT, ANNE'S EYES HAD CAUGHT
THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND DISTINGUISHED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH STANDING
AMONG A CLUSTER OF MEN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE.  AS HER EYES FELL ON HIM,
HIS SEEMED TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM HER.  IT HAD THAT APPEARANCE.
IT SEEMED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ONE MOMENT TOO LATE; AND AS LONG AS SHE
DARED OBSERVE, HE DID NOT LOOK AGAIN:  BUT THE PERFORMANCE
WAS RECOMMENCING, AND SHE WAS FORCED TO SEEM TO RESTORE HER ATTENTION
TO THE ORCHESTRA AND LOOK STRAIGHT FORWARD.

WHEN SHE COULD GIVE ANOTHER GLANCE, HE HAD MOVED AWAY.  HE COULD NOT HAVE
COME NEARER TO HER IF HE WOULD; SHE WAS SO SURROUNDED AND SHUT IN:
BUT SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE CAUGHT HIS EYE.

MR ELLIOT'S SPEECH, TOO, DISTRESSED HER.  SHE HAD NO LONGER
ANY INCLINATION TO TALK TO HIM.  SHE WISHED HIM NOT SO NEAR HER.

THE FIRST ACT WAS OVER.  NOW SHE HOPED FOR SOME BENEFICIAL CHANGE;
AND, AFTER A PERIOD OF NOTHING-SAYING AMONGST THE PARTY, SOME OF THEM
DID DECIDE ON GOING IN QUEST OF TEA.  ANNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW WHO
DID NOT CHOOSE TO MOVE.  SHE REMAINED IN HER SEAT, AND SO DID LADY RUSSELL;
BUT SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF GETTING RID OF MR ELLIOT; AND SHE DID NOT MEAN,
WHATEVER SHE MIGHT FEEL ON LADY RUSSELL'S ACCOUNT, TO SHRINK FROM
CONVERSATION WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IF HE GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY.
SHE WAS PERSUADED BY LADY RUSSELL'S COUNTENANCE THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIM.

HE DID NOT COME HOWEVER.  ANNE SOMETIMES FANCIED SHE DISCERNED HIM
AT A DISTANCE, BUT HE NEVER CAME.  THE ANXIOUS INTERVAL
WORE AWAY UNPRODUCTIVELY.  THE OTHERS RETURNED, THE ROOM FILLED AGAIN,
BENCHES WERE RECLAIMED AND REPOSSESSED, AND ANOTHER HOUR OF PLEASURE
OR OF PENANCE WAS TO BE SAT OUT, ANOTHER HOUR OF MUSIC WAS TO GIVE
DELIGHT OR THE GAPES, AS REAL OR AFFECTED TASTE FOR IT PREVAILED.
TO ANNE, IT CHIEFLY WORE THE PROSPECT OF AN HOUR OF AGITATION.
SHE COULD NOT QUIT THAT ROOM IN PEACE WITHOUT SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
ONCE MORE, WITHOUT THE INTERCHANGE OF ONE FRIENDLY LOOK.

IN RE-SETTLING THEMSELVES THERE WERE NOW MANY CHANGES, THE RESULT OF WHICH
WAS FAVOURABLE FOR HER.  COLONEL WALLIS DECLINED SITTING DOWN AGAIN,
AND MR ELLIOT WAS INVITED BY ELIZABETH AND MISS CARTERET, IN A MANNER
NOT TO BE REFUSED, TO SIT BETWEEN THEM; AND BY SOME OTHER REMOVALS,
AND A LITTLE SCHEMING OF HER OWN,  ANNE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HERSELF
MUCH NEARER THE END OF THE BENCH THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE,
MUCH MORE WITHIN REACH OF A PASSER-BY.  SHE COULD NOT DO SO,
WITHOUT COMPARING HERSELF WITH MISS LAROLLES, THE INIMITABLE MISS LAROLLES;
BUT STILL SHE DID IT, AND NOT WITH MUCH HAPPIER EFFECT;
THOUGH BY WHAT SEEMED PROSPERITY IN THE SHAPE OF AN EARLY ABDICATION
IN HER NEXT NEIGHBOURS, SHE FOUND HERSELF AT THE VERY END OF THE BENCH
BEFORE THE CONCERT CLOSED.

SUCH WAS HER SITUATION, WITH A VACANT SPACE AT HAND, WHEN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
WAS AGAIN IN SIGHT.  SHE SAW HIM NOT FAR OFF.  HE SAW HER TOO;
YET HE LOOKED GRAVE, AND SEEMED IRRESOLUTE, AND ONLY BY VERY SLOW DEGREES
CAME AT LAST NEAR ENOUGH TO SPEAK TO HER.  SHE FELT THAT SOMETHING
MUST BE THE MATTER.  THE CHANGE WAS INDUBITABLE.  THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN HIS PRESENT AIR AND WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THE OCTAGON ROOM
WAS STRIKINGLY GREAT.  WHY WAS IT?  SHE THOUGHT OF HER FATHER,
OF LADY RUSSELL.  COULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANY UNPLEASANT GLANCES?
HE BEGAN BY SPEAKING OF THE CONCERT GRAVELY, MORE LIKE THE CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH OF UPPERCROSS; OWNED HIMSELF DISAPPOINTED, HAD EXPECTED SINGING;
AND IN SHORT, MUST CONFESS THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE SORRY WHEN IT WAS OVER.
ANNE REPLIED, AND SPOKE IN DEFENCE OF THE PERFORMANCE SO WELL,
AND YET IN ALLOWANCE FOR HIS FEELINGS SO PLEASANTLY, THAT HIS COUNTENANCE
IMPROVED, AND HE REPLIED AGAIN WITH ALMOST A SMILE.  THEY TALKED
FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE; THE IMPROVEMENT HELD; HE EVEN LOOKED DOWN
TOWARDS THE BENCH, AS IF HE SAW A PLACE ON IT WELL WORTH OCCUPYING;
WHEN AT THAT MOMENT A TOUCH ON HER SHOULDER OBLIGED ANNE TO TURN ROUND.
IT CAME FROM MR ELLIOT.  HE BEGGED HER PARDON, BUT SHE MUST BE APPLIED TO,
TO EXPLAIN ITALIAN AGAIN.  MISS CARTERET WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE
A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT WAS NEXT TO BE SUNG.  ANNE COULD NOT REFUSE;
BUT NEVER HAD SHE SACRIFICED TO POLITENESS WITH A MORE SUFFERING SPIRIT.

A FEW MINUTES, THOUGH AS FEW AS POSSIBLE, WERE INEVITABLY CONSUMED;
AND WHEN HER OWN MISTRESS AGAIN, WHEN ABLE TO TURN AND LOOK
AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE, SHE FOUND HERSELF ACCOSTED BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
IN A RESERVED YET HURRIED SORT OF FAREWELL.  "HE MUST WISH HER GOOD NIGHT;
HE WAS GOING; HE SHOULD GET HOME AS FAST AS HE COULD."

"IS NOT THIS SONG WORTH STAYING FOR?" SAID ANNE, SUDDENLY STRUCK
BY AN IDEA WHICH MADE HER YET MORE ANXIOUS TO BE ENCOURAGING.

"NO!" HE REPLIED IMPRESSIVELY, "THERE IS NOTHING WORTH MY STAYING FOR;"
AND HE WAS GONE DIRECTLY.

JEALOUSY OF MR ELLIOT!  IT WAS THE ONLY INTELLIGIBLE MOTIVE.
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH JEALOUS OF HER AFFECTION!  COULD SHE HAVE BELIEVED IT
A WEEK AGO; THREE HOURS AGO!  FOR A MOMENT THE GRATIFICATION WAS EXQUISITE.
BUT, ALAS! THERE WERE VERY DIFFERENT THOUGHTS TO SUCCEED.
HOW WAS SUCH JEALOUSY TO BE QUIETED?  HOW WAS THE TRUTH TO REACH HIM?
HOW, IN ALL THE PECULIAR DISADVANTAGES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SITUATIONS,
WOULD HE EVER LEARN OF HER REAL SENTIMENTS?  IT WAS MISERY TO THINK
OF MR ELLIOT'S ATTENTIONS.  THEIR EVIL WAS INCALCULABLE.



CHAPTER 21


ANNE RECOLLECTED WITH PLEASURE THE NEXT MORNING HER PROMISE
OF GOING TO MRS SMITH, MEANING THAT IT SHOULD ENGAGE HER FROM HOME
AT THE TIME WHEN MR ELLIOT WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO CALL; FOR TO AVOID
MR ELLIOT WAS ALMOST A FIRST OBJECT.

SHE FELT A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD-WILL TOWARDS HIM.  IN SPITE OF
THE MISCHIEF OF HIS ATTENTIONS, SHE OWED HIM GRATITUDE AND REGARD,
PERHAPS COMPASSION.  SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING MUCH OF THE EXTRAORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THEIR ACQUAINTANCE, OF THE RIGHT WHICH
HE SEEMED TO HAVE TO INTEREST HER, BY EVERYTHING IN SITUATION,
BY HIS OWN SENTIMENTS, BY HIS EARLY PREPOSSESSION.  IT WAS ALTOGETHER
VERY EXTRAORDINARY; FLATTERING, BUT PAINFUL.  THERE WAS MUCH TO REGRET.
HOW SHE MIGHT HAVE FELT HAD THERE BEEN NO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IN THE CASE,
WAS NOT WORTH ENQUIRY; FOR THERE WAS A CAPTAIN WENTWORTH;
AND BE THE CONCLUSION OF THE PRESENT SUSPENSE GOOD OR BAD,
HER AFFECTION WOULD BE HIS FOR EVER.  THEIR UNION, SHE BELIEVED,
COULD NOT DIVIDE HER MORE FROM OTHER MEN, THAN THEIR FINAL SEPARATION.

PRETTIER MUSINGS OF HIGH-WROUGHT LOVE AND ETERNAL CONSTANCY,
COULD NEVER HAVE PASSED ALONG THE STREETS OF BATH, THAN ANNE
WAS SPORTING WITH FROM CAMDEN PLACE TO WESTGATE BUILDINGS.
IT WAS ALMOST ENOUGH TO SPREAD PURIFICATION AND PERFUME ALL THE WAY.

SHE WAS SURE OF A PLEASANT RECEPTION; AND HER FRIEND SEEMED THIS MORNING
PARTICULARLY OBLIGED TO HER FOR COMING, SEEMED HARDLY TO HAVE EXPECTED HER,
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN APPOINTMENT.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONCERT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLAIMED; AND ANNE'S RECOLLECTIONS
OF THE CONCERT WERE QUITE HAPPY ENOUGH TO ANIMATE HER FEATURES
AND MAKE HER REJOICE TO TALK OF IT.  ALL THAT SHE COULD TELL
SHE TOLD MOST GLADLY, BUT THE ALL WAS LITTLE FOR ONE WHO HAD BEEN THERE,
AND UNSATISFACTORY FOR SUCH AN ENQUIRER AS MRS SMITH, WHO HAD
ALREADY HEARD, THROUGH THE SHORT CUT OF A LAUNDRESS AND A WAITER,
RATHER MORE OF THE GENERAL SUCCESS AND PRODUCE OF THE EVENING
THAN ANNE COULD RELATE, AND WHO NOW ASKED IN VAIN FOR SEVERAL PARTICULARS
OF THE COMPANY.  EVERYBODY OF ANY CONSEQUENCE OR NOTORIETY IN BATH
WAS WELL KNOW BY NAME TO MRS SMITH.

"THE LITTLE DURANDS WERE THERE, I CONCLUDE," SAID SHE, "WITH THEIR MOUTHS
OPEN TO CATCH THE MUSIC, LIKE UNFLEDGED SPARROWS READY TO BE FED.
THEY NEVER MISS A CONCERT."

"YES; I DID NOT SEE THEM MYSELF, BUT I HEARD MR ELLIOT SAY THEY WERE
IN THE ROOM."

"THE IBBOTSONS, WERE THEY THERE? AND THE TWO NEW BEAUTIES,
WITH THE TALL IRISH OFFICER, WHO IS TALKED OF FOR ONE OF THEM."

"I DO NOT KNOW.  I DO NOT THINK THEY WERE."

"OLD LADY MARY MACLEAN?  I NEED NOT ASK AFTER HER.  SHE NEVER MISSES,
I KNOW; AND YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HER.  SHE MUST HAVE BEEN IN YOUR OWN CIRCLE;
FOR AS YOU WENT WITH LADY DALRYMPLE, YOU WERE IN THE SEATS OF GRANDEUR,
ROUND THE ORCHESTRA, OF COURSE."

"NO, THAT WAS WHAT I DREADED.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNPLEASANT TO ME
IN EVERY RESPECT.  BUT HAPPILY LADY DALRYMPLE ALWAYS CHOOSES
TO BE FARTHER OFF; AND WE WERE EXCEEDINGLY WELL PLACED, THAT IS,
FOR HEARING; I MUST NOT SAY FOR SEEING, BECAUSE I APPEAR TO HAVE SEEN
VERY LITTLE."

"OH! YOU SAW ENOUGH FOR YOUR OWN AMUSEMENT.  I CAN UNDERSTAND.
THERE IS A SORT OF DOMESTIC ENJOYMENT TO BE KNOWN EVEN IN A CROWD,
AND THIS YOU HAD.  YOU WERE A LARGE PARTY IN YOURSELVES,
AND YOU WANTED NOTHING BEYOND."

"BUT I OUGHT TO HAVE LOOKED ABOUT ME MORE," SAID ANNE, CONSCIOUS
WHILE SHE SPOKE THAT THERE HAD IN FACT BEEN NO WANT OF LOOKING ABOUT,
THAT THE OBJECT ONLY HAD BEEN DEFICIENT.

"NO, NO; YOU WERE BETTER EMPLOYED.  YOU NEED NOT TELL ME THAT YOU
HAD A PLEASANT EVENING.  I SEE IT IN YOUR EYE.  I PERFECTLY SEE
HOW THE HOURS PASSED:  THAT YOU HAD ALWAYS SOMETHING AGREEABLE
TO LISTEN TO.  IN THE INTERVALS OF THE CONCERT IT WAS CONVERSATION."

ANNE HALF SMILED AND SAID, "DO YOU SEE THAT IN MY EYE?"

"YES, I DO.  YOUR COUNTENANCE PERFECTLY INFORMS ME THAT YOU WERE
IN COMPANY LAST NIGHT WITH THE PERSON WHOM YOU THINK THE MOST AGREEABLE
IN THE WORLD, THE PERSON WHO INTERESTS YOU AT THIS PRESENT TIME
MORE THAN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD PUT TOGETHER."

A BLUSH OVERSPREAD ANNE'S CHEEKS.  SHE COULD SAY NOTHING.

"AND SUCH BEING THE CASE," CONTINUED MRS SMITH, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE,
"I HOPE YOU BELIEVE THAT I DO KNOW HOW TO VALUE YOUR KINDNESS
IN COMING TO ME THIS MORNING.  IT IS REALLY VERY GOOD OF YOU
TO COME AND SIT WITH ME, WHEN YOU MUST HAVE SO MANY PLEASANTER DEMANDS
UPON YOUR TIME."

ANNE HEARD NOTHING OF THIS.  SHE WAS STILL IN THE ASTONISHMENT AND
CONFUSION EXCITED BY HER FRIEND'S PENETRATION, UNABLE TO IMAGINE
HOW ANY REPORT OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH COULD HAVE REACHED HER.
AFTER ANOTHER SHORT SILENCE--

"PRAY," SAID MRS SMITH, "IS MR ELLIOT AWARE OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH ME?
DOES HE KNOW THAT I AM IN BATH?"

"MR ELLIOT!" REPEATED ANNE, LOOKING UP SURPRISED.  A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
SHEWED HER THE MISTAKE SHE HAD BEEN UNDER.  SHE CAUGHT IT INSTANTANEOUSLY;
AND RECOVERING HER COURAGE WITH THE FEELING OF SAFETY, SOON ADDED,
MORE COMPOSEDLY, "ARE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH MR ELLIOT?"

"I HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL ACQUAINTED WITH HIM," REPLIED MRS SMITH, GRAVELY,
"BUT IT SEEMS WORN OUT NOW.  IT IS A GREAT WHILE SINCE WE MET."

"I WAS NOT AT ALL AWARE OF THIS.  YOU NEVER MENTIONED IT BEFORE.
HAD I KNOWN IT, I WOULD HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF TALKING TO HIM ABOUT YOU."

"TO CONFESS THE TRUTH," SAID MRS SMITH, ASSUMING HER USUAL
AIR OF CHEERFULNESS, "THAT IS EXACTLY THE PLEASURE I WANT YOU TO HAVE.
I WANT YOU TO TALK ABOUT ME TO MR ELLIOT.  I WANT YOUR INTEREST WITH HIM.
HE CAN BE OF ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO ME; AND IF YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS,
MY DEAR MISS ELLIOT, TO MAKE IT AN OBJECT TO YOURSELF,
OF COURSE IT IS DONE."

"I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY HAPPY; I HOPE YOU CANNOT DOUBT MY WILLINGNESS
TO BE OF EVEN THE SLIGHTEST USE TO YOU," REPLIED ANNE; "BUT I SUSPECT
THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING ME AS HAVING A HIGHER CLAIM ON MR ELLIOT,
A GREATER RIGHT TO INFLUENCE HIM, THAN IS REALLY THE CASE.
I AM SURE YOU HAVE, SOMEHOW OR OTHER, IMBIBED SUCH A NOTION.
YOU MUST CONSIDER ME ONLY AS MR ELLIOT'S RELATION.  IF IN THAT LIGHT
THERE IS ANYTHING WHICH YOU SUPPOSE HIS COUSIN MIGHT FAIRLY ASK OF HIM,
I BEG YOU WOULD NOT HESITATE TO EMPLOY ME."

MRS SMITH GAVE HER A PENETRATING GLANCE, AND THEN, SMILING, SAID--

"I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE PREMATURE, I PERCEIVE; I BEG YOUR PARDON.
I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED FOR OFFICIAL INFORMATION,  BUT NOW, MY DEAR
MISS ELLIOT, AS AN OLD FRIEND, DO GIVE ME A HINT AS TO WHEN I MAY SPEAK.
NEXT WEEK?  TO BE SURE BY NEXT WEEK I MAY BE ALLOWED TO
THINK IT ALL SETTLED, AND BUILD MY OWN SELFISH SCHEMES ON
MR ELLIOT'S GOOD FORTUNE."

"NO," REPLIED ANNE, "NOR NEXT WEEK, NOR NEXT, NOR NEXT.
I ASSURE YOU THAT NOTHING OF THE SORT YOU ARE THINKING OF
WILL BE SETTLED ANY WEEK.  I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY MR ELLIOT.
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY YOU IMAGINE I AM?"

MRS SMITH LOOKED AT HER AGAIN, LOOKED EARNESTLY, SMILED,
SHOOK HER HEAD, AND EXCLAIMED--

"NOW, HOW I DO WISH I UNDERSTOOD YOU!  HOW I DO WISH I KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE AT!  I HAVE A GREAT IDEA THAT YOU DO NOT DESIGN TO BE CRUEL,
WHEN THE RIGHT MOMENT OCCURS.  TILL IT DOES COME, YOU KNOW,
WE WOMEN NEVER MEAN TO HAVE ANYBODY.  IT IS A THING OF COURSE AMONG US,
THAT EVERY MAN IS REFUSED, TILL HE OFFERS.  BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BE CRUEL?
LET ME PLEAD FOR MY--PRESENT FRIEND I CANNOT CALL HIM, BUT FOR
MY FORMER FRIEND.  WHERE CAN YOU LOOK FOR A MORE SUITABLE MATCH?
WHERE COULD YOU EXPECT A MORE GENTLEMANLIKE, AGREEABLE MAN?
LET ME RECOMMEND MR ELLIOT.  I AM SURE YOU HEAR NOTHING BUT GOOD OF HIM
FROM COLONEL WALLIS; AND WHO CAN KNOW HIM BETTER THAN COLONEL WALLIS?"

"MY DEAR MRS SMITH, MR ELLIOT'S WIFE HAS NOT BEEN DEAD MUCH ABOVE
HALF A YEAR.  HE OUGHT NOT TO BE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING HIS ADDRESSES
TO ANY ONE."

"OH! IF THESE ARE YOUR ONLY OBJECTIONS," CRIED MRS SMITH, ARCHLY,
"MR ELLIOT IS SAFE, AND I SHALL GIVE MYSELF NO MORE TROUBLE ABOUT HIM.
DO NOT FORGET ME WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED, THAT'S ALL.  LET HIM KNOW ME TO BE
A FRIEND OF YOURS, AND THEN HE WILL THINK LITTLE OF THE TROUBLE REQUIRED,
WHICH IT IS VERY NATURAL FOR HIM NOW, WITH SO MANY AFFAIRS AND ENGAGEMENTS
OF HIS OWN, TO AVOID AND GET RID OF AS HE CAN; VERY NATURAL, PERHAPS.
NINETY-NINE OUT OF A HUNDRED WOULD DO THE SAME.  OF COURSE,
HE CANNOT BE AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE TO ME.  WELL, MY DEAR MISS ELLIOT,
I HOPE AND TRUST YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY.  MR ELLIOT HAS SENSE
TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF SUCH A WOMAN.  YOUR PEACE WILL NOT BE
SHIPWRECKED AS MINE HAS BEEN.  YOU ARE SAFE IN ALL WORLDLY MATTERS,
AND SAFE IN HIS CHARACTER.  HE WILL NOT BE LED ASTRAY; HE WILL NOT BE
MISLED BY OTHERS TO HIS RUIN."

"NO," SAID ANNE, "I CAN READILY BELIEVE ALL THAT OF MY COUSIN.
HE SEEMS TO HAVE A CALM DECIDED TEMPER, NOT AT ALL OPEN
TO DANGEROUS IMPRESSIONS.  I CONSIDER HIM WITH GREAT RESPECT.
I HAVE NO REASON, FROM ANY THING THAT HAS FALLEN WITHIN MY OBSERVATION,
TO DO OTHERWISE.  BUT I HAVE NOT KNOWN HIM LONG; AND HE IS NOT A MAN,
I THINK, TO BE KNOWN INTIMATELY SOON.  WILL NOT THIS MANNER
OF SPEAKING OF HIM, MRS SMITH, CONVINCE YOU THAT HE IS NOTHING TO ME?
SURELY THIS MUST BE CALM ENOUGH.  AND, UPON MY WORD, HE IS NOTHING TO ME.
SHOULD HE EVER PROPOSE TO ME (WHICH I HAVE VERY LITTLE REASON TO IMAGINE
HE HAS ANY THOUGHT OF DOING), I SHALL NOT ACCEPT HIM.  I ASSURE YOU
I SHALL NOT.  I ASSURE YOU, MR ELLIOT HAD NOT THE SHARE WHICH
YOU HAVE BEEN SUPPOSING, IN WHATEVER PLEASURE THE CONCERT
OF LAST NIGHT MIGHT AFFORD:  NOT MR ELLIOT; IT IS NOT MR ELLIOT THAT--"

SHE STOPPED, REGRETTING WITH A DEEP BLUSH THAT SHE HAD IMPLIED SO MUCH;
BUT LESS WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT.  MRS SMITH WOULD HARDLY
HAVE BELIEVED SO SOON IN MR ELLIOT'S FAILURE, BUT FROM THE PERCEPTION
OF THERE BEING A SOMEBODY ELSE.  AS IT WAS, SHE INSTANTLY SUBMITTED,
AND WITH ALL THE SEMBLANCE OF SEEING NOTHING BEYOND; AND ANNE,
EAGER TO ESCAPE FARTHER NOTICE, WAS IMPATIENT TO KNOW WHY MRS SMITH
SHOULD HAVE FANCIED SHE WAS TO MARRY MR ELLIOT; WHERE SHE COULD HAVE
RECEIVED THE IDEA, OR FROM WHOM SHE COULD HAVE HEARD IT.

"DO TELL ME HOW IT FIRST CAME INTO YOUR HEAD."

"IT FIRST CAME INTO MY HEAD," REPLIED MRS SMITH, "UPON FINDING HOW MUCH
YOU WERE TOGETHER, AND FEELING IT TO BE THE MOST PROBABLE THING
IN THE WORLD TO BE WISHED FOR BY EVERYBODY BELONGING TO EITHER OF YOU;
AND YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THAT ALL YOUR ACQUAINTANCE HAVE DISPOSED OF YOU
IN THE SAME WAY.  BUT I NEVER HEARD IT SPOKEN OF TILL TWO DAYS AGO."

"AND HAS IT INDEED BEEN SPOKEN OF?"

"DID YOU OBSERVE THE WOMAN WHO OPENED THE DOOR TO YOU WHEN
YOU CALLED YESTERDAY?"

"NO.  WAS NOT IT MRS SPEED, AS USUAL, OR THE MAID?  I OBSERVED
NO ONE IN PARTICULAR."

"IT WAS MY FRIEND MRS ROOKE; NURSE ROOKE; WHO, BY-THE-BYE,
HAD A GREAT CURIOSITY TO SEE YOU, AND WAS DELIGHTED TO BE IN THE WAY
TO LET YOU IN.  SHE CAME AWAY FROM MARLBOROUGH BUILDINGS ONLY ON SUNDAY;
AND SHE IT WAS WHO TOLD ME YOU WERE TO MARRY MR ELLIOT.
SHE HAD HAD IT FROM MRS WALLIS HERSELF, WHICH DID NOT SEEM BAD AUTHORITY.
SHE SAT AN HOUR WITH ME ON MONDAY EVENING, AND GAVE ME THE WHOLE HISTORY."
"THE WHOLE HISTORY," REPEATED ANNE, LAUGHING.  "SHE COULD NOT MAKE
A VERY LONG HISTORY, I THINK, OF ONE SUCH LITTLE ARTICLE
OF UNFOUNDED NEWS."

MRS SMITH SAID NOTHING.

"BUT," CONTINUED ANNE, PRESENTLY, "THOUGH THERE IS NO TRUTH IN MY HAVING
THIS CLAIM ON MR ELLIOT, I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY HAPPY TO BE OF USE TO YOU
IN ANY WAY THAT I COULD.  SHALL I MENTION TO HIM YOUR BEING IN BATH?
SHALL I TAKE ANY MESSAGE?"

"NO, I THANK YOU:  NO, CERTAINLY NOT.  IN THE WARMTH OF THE MOMENT,
AND UNDER A MISTAKEN IMPRESSION, I MIGHT, PERHAPS, HAVE ENDEAVOURED
TO INTEREST YOU IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES; BUT NOT NOW.  NO, I THANK YOU,
I HAVE NOTHING TO TROUBLE YOU WITH."

"I THINK YOU SPOKE OF HAVING KNOWN MR ELLIOT MANY YEARS?"

"I DID."

"NOT BEFORE HE WAS MARRIED, I SUPPOSE?"

"YES; HE WAS NOT MARRIED WHEN I KNEW HIM FIRST."

"AND--WERE YOU MUCH ACQUAINTED?"

"INTIMATELY."

"INDEED!  THEN DO TELL ME WHAT HE WAS AT THAT TIME OF LIFE.
I HAVE A GREAT CURIOSITY TO KNOW WHAT MR ELLIOT WAS AS A VERY YOUNG MAN.
WAS HE AT ALL SUCH AS HE APPEARS NOW?"

"I HAVE NOT SEEN MR ELLIOT THESE THREE YEARS," WAS MRS SMITH'S ANSWER,
GIVEN SO GRAVELY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PURSUE THE SUBJECT FARTHER;
AND ANNE FELT THAT SHE HAD GAINED NOTHING BUT AN INCREASE OF CURIOSITY.
THEY WERE BOTH SILENT:  MRS SMITH VERY THOUGHTFUL.  AT LAST--

"I BEG YOUR PARDON, MY DEAR MISS ELLIOT," SHE CRIED, IN HER
NATURAL TONE OF CORDIALITY, "I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE SHORT ANSWERS
I HAVE BEEN GIVING YOU, BUT I HAVE BEEN UNCERTAIN WHAT I OUGHT TO DO.
I HAVE BEEN DOUBTING AND CONSIDERING AS TO WHAT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU.
THERE WERE MANY THINGS TO BE TAKEN INTO THE ACCOUNT.  ONE HATES
TO BE OFFICIOUS, TO BE GIVING BAD IMPRESSIONS, MAKING MISCHIEF.
EVEN THE SMOOTH SURFACE OF FAMILY-UNION SEEMS WORTH PRESERVING,
THOUGH THERE MAY BE NOTHING DURABLE BENEATH.  HOWEVER, I HAVE DETERMINED;
I THINK I AM RIGHT; I THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE MADE ACQUAINTED
WITH MR ELLIOT'S REAL CHARACTER.  THOUGH I FULLY BELIEVE THAT,
AT PRESENT, YOU HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST INTENTION OF ACCEPTING HIM,
THERE IS NO SAYING WHAT MAY HAPPEN.  YOU MIGHT, SOME TIME OR OTHER,
BE DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED TOWARDS HIM.  HEAR THE TRUTH, THEREFORE,
NOW, WHILE YOU ARE UNPREJUDICED.  MR ELLIOT IS A MAN WITHOUT HEART
OR CONSCIENCE; A DESIGNING, WARY, COLD-BLOODED BEING, WHO THINKS
ONLY OF HIMSELF; WHOM FOR HIS OWN INTEREST OR EASE, WOULD BE GUILTY
OF ANY CRUELTY, OR ANY TREACHERY, THAT COULD BE PERPETRATED WITHOUT
RISK OF HIS GENERAL CHARACTER.  HE HAS NO FEELING FOR OTHERS.
THOSE WHOM HE HAS BEEN THE CHIEF CAUSE OF LEADING INTO RUIN,
HE CAN NEGLECT AND DESERT WITHOUT THE SMALLEST COMPUNCTION.
HE IS TOTALLY BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY SENTIMENT OF JUSTICE OR COMPASSION.
OH! HE IS BLACK AT HEART, HOLLOW AND BLACK!"

ANNE'S ASTONISHED AIR, AND EXCLAMATION OF WONDER, MADE HER PAUSE,
AND IN A CALMER MANNER, SHE ADDED,

"MY EXPRESSIONS STARTLE YOU.  YOU MUST ALLOW FOR AN INJURED, ANGRY WOMAN.
BUT I WILL TRY TO COMMAND MYSELF.  I WILL NOT ABUSE HIM.
I WILL ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE FOUND HIM.  FACTS SHALL SPEAK.
HE WAS THE INTIMATE FRIEND OF MY DEAR HUSBAND, WHO TRUSTED AND LOVED HIM,
AND THOUGHT HIM AS GOOD AS HIMSELF.  THE INTIMACY HAD BEEN FORMED
BEFORE OUR MARRIAGE.  I FOUND THEM MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS; AND I, TOO,
BECAME EXCESSIVELY PLEASED WITH MR ELLIOT, AND ENTERTAINED
THE HIGHEST OPINION OF HIM.  AT NINETEEN, YOU KNOW, ONE DOES NOT
THINK VERY SERIOUSLY; BUT MR ELLIOT APPEARED TO ME QUITE AS GOOD AS OTHERS,
AND MUCH MORE AGREEABLE THAN MOST OTHERS, AND WE WERE ALMOST
ALWAYS TOGETHER.  WE WERE PRINCIPALLY IN TOWN, LIVING IN VERY GOOD STYLE.
HE WAS THEN THE INFERIOR IN CIRCUMSTANCES; HE WAS THEN THE POOR ONE;
HE HAD CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPLE, AND IT WAS AS MUCH AS HE COULD DO
TO SUPPORT THE APPEARANCE OF A GENTLEMAN.  HE HAD ALWAYS A HOME
WITH US WHENEVER HE CHOSE IT; HE WAS ALWAYS WELCOME; HE WAS LIKE A BROTHER.
MY POOR CHARLES, WHO HAD THE FINEST, MOST GENEROUS SPIRIT IN THE WORLD,
WOULD HAVE DIVIDED HIS LAST FARTHING WITH HIM; AND I KNOW THAT HIS PURSE
WAS OPEN TO HIM; I KNOW THAT HE OFTEN ASSISTED HIM."

"THIS MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT VERY PERIOD OF MR ELLIOT'S LIFE,"
SAID ANNE, "WHICH HAS ALWAYS EXCITED MY PARTICULAR CURIOSITY.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT HE BECAME KNOWN TO
MY FATHER AND SISTER.  I NEVER KNEW HIM MYSELF; I ONLY HEARD OF HIM;
BUT THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN HIS CONDUCT THEN, WITH REGARD TO
MY FATHER AND SISTER, AND AFTERWARDS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS MARRIAGE,
WHICH I NEVER COULD QUITE RECONCILE WITH PRESENT TIMES.  IT SEEMED
TO ANNOUNCE A DIFFERENT SORT OF MAN."

"I KNOW IT ALL, I KNOW IT ALL," CRIED MRS SMITH.  "HE HAD BEEN
INTRODUCED TO SIR WALTER AND YOUR SISTER BEFORE I WAS ACQUAINTED WITH HIM,
BUT I HEARD HIM SPEAK OF THEM FOR EVER.  I KNOW HE WAS INVITED
AND ENCOURAGED, AND I KNOW HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO GO.  I CAN SATISFY YOU,
PERHAPS, ON POINTS WHICH YOU WOULD LITTLE EXPECT; AND AS TO HIS MARRIAGE,
I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AT THE TIME.  I WAS PRIVY TO ALL THE FORS AND AGAINSTS;
I WAS THE FRIEND TO WHOM HE CONFIDED HIS HOPES AND PLANS; AND THOUGH
I DID NOT KNOW HIS WIFE PREVIOUSLY, HER INFERIOR SITUATION IN SOCIETY,
INDEED, RENDERED THAT IMPOSSIBLE, YET I KNEW HER ALL HER LIFE AFTERWARDS,
OR AT LEAST TILL WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF HER LIFE, AND CAN ANSWER
ANY QUESTION YOU MAY WISH TO PUT."

"NAY," SAID ANNE, "I HAVE NO PARTICULAR ENQUIRY TO MAKE ABOUT HER.
I HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE NOT A HAPPY COUPLE.  BUT I SHOULD
LIKE TO KNOW WHY, AT THAT TIME OF HIS LIFE, HE SHOULD SLIGHT
MY FATHER'S ACQUAINTANCE AS HE DID.  MY FATHER WAS CERTAINLY DISPOSED
TO TAKE VERY KIND AND PROPER NOTICE OF HIM.  WHY DID MR ELLIOT DRAW BACK?"

"MR ELLIOT," REPLIED MRS SMITH, "AT THAT PERIOD OF HIS LIFE,
HAD ONE OBJECT IN VIEW:  TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE, AND BY A RATHER QUICKER
PROCESS THAN THE LAW.  HE WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE IT BY MARRIAGE.
HE WAS DETERMINED, AT LEAST, NOT TO MAR IT BY AN IMPRUDENT MARRIAGE;
AND I KNOW IT WAS HIS BELIEF (WHETHER JUSTLY OR NOT, OF COURSE
I CANNOT DECIDE), THAT YOUR FATHER AND SISTER, IN THEIR CIVILITIES
AND INVITATIONS, WERE DESIGNING A MATCH BETWEEN THE HEIR
AND THE YOUNG LADY, AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SUCH A MATCH
SHOULD HAVE ANSWERED HIS IDEAS OF WEALTH AND INDEPENDENCE.
THAT WAS HIS MOTIVE FOR DRAWING BACK, I CAN ASSURE YOU.
HE TOLD ME THE WHOLE STORY.  HE HAD NO CONCEALMENTS WITH ME.
IT WAS CURIOUS, THAT HAVING JUST LEFT YOU BEHIND ME IN BATH,
MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL ACQUAINTANCE ON MARRYING SHOULD BE YOUR COUSIN;
AND THAT, THROUGH HIM, I SHOULD BE CONTINUALLY HEARING OF YOUR FATHER
AND SISTER.  HE DESCRIBED ONE MISS ELLIOT, AND I THOUGHT
VERY AFFECTIONATELY OF THE OTHER."

"PERHAPS," CRIED ANNE, STRUCK BY A SUDDEN IDEA, "YOU SOMETIMES
SPOKE OF ME TO MR ELLIOT?"

"TO BE SURE I DID; VERY OFTEN.  I USED TO BOAST OF MY OWN ANNE ELLIOT,
AND VOUCH FOR YOUR BEING A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE FROM--"

SHE CHECKED HERSELF JUST IN TIME.

"THIS ACCOUNTS FOR SOMETHING WHICH MR ELLIOT SAID LAST NIGHT,"
CRIED ANNE.  "THIS EXPLAINS IT.  I FOUND HE HAD BEEN USED TO HEAR OF ME.
I COULD NOT COMPREHEND HOW.  WHAT WILD IMAGINATIONS ONE FORMS WHERE
DEAR SELF IS CONCERNED!  HOW SURE TO BE MISTAKEN!  BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON;
I HAVE INTERRUPTED YOU.  MR ELLIOT MARRIED THEN COMPLETELY FOR MONEY?
THE CIRCUMSTANCES, PROBABLY, WHICH FIRST OPENED YOUR EYES
TO HIS CHARACTER."

MRS SMITH HESITATED A LITTLE HERE.  "OH! THOSE THINGS ARE TOO COMMON.
WHEN ONE LIVES IN THE WORLD, A MAN OR WOMAN'S MARRYING FOR MONEY
IS TOO COMMON TO STRIKE ONE AS IT OUGHT.  I WAS VERY YOUNG,
AND ASSOCIATED ONLY WITH THE YOUNG, AND WE WERE A THOUGHTLESS,
GAY SET, WITHOUT ANY STRICT RULES OF CONDUCT.  WE LIVED FOR ENJOYMENT.
I THINK DIFFERENTLY NOW; TIME AND SICKNESS AND SORROW HAVE GIVEN ME
OTHER NOTIONS; BUT AT THAT PERIOD I MUST OWN I SAW NOTHING REPREHENSIBLE
IN WHAT MR ELLIOT WAS DOING.  `TO DO THE BEST FOR HIMSELF,'
PASSED AS A DUTY."

"BUT WAS NOT SHE A VERY LOW WOMAN?"

"YES; WHICH I OBJECTED TO, BUT HE WOULD NOT REGARD.  MONEY, MONEY,
WAS ALL THAT HE WANTED.  HER FATHER WAS A GRAZIER, HER GRANDFATHER
HAD BEEN A BUTCHER, BUT THAT WAS ALL NOTHING.  SHE WAS A FINE WOMAN,
HAD HAD A DECENT EDUCATION, WAS BROUGHT FORWARD BY SOME COUSINS,
THROWN BY CHANCE INTO MR ELLIOT'S COMPANY, AND FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM;
AND NOT A DIFFICULTY OR A SCRUPLE WAS THERE ON HIS SIDE,
WITH RESPECT TO HER BIRTH.  ALL HIS CAUTION WAS SPENT IN BEING SECURED
OF THE REAL AMOUNT OF HER FORTUNE, BEFORE HE COMMITTED HIMSELF.
DEPEND UPON IT, WHATEVER ESTEEM MR ELLIOT MAY HAVE FOR HIS OWN SITUATION
IN LIFE NOW, AS A YOUNG MAN HE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST VALUE FOR IT.
HIS CHANCE FOR THE KELLYNCH ESTATE WAS SOMETHING, BUT ALL THE HONOUR
OF THE FAMILY HE HELD AS CHEAP AS DIRT.  I HAVE OFTEN HEARD HIM DECLARE,
THAT IF BARONETCIES WERE SALEABLE, ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE HIS
FOR FIFTY POUNDS, ARMS AND MOTTO, NAME AND LIVERY INCLUDED;
BUT I WILL NOT PRETEND TO REPEAT HALF THAT I USED TO HEAR HIM SAY
ON THAT SUBJECT.  IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR; AND YET YOU OUGHT TO HAVE PROOF,
FOR WHAT IS ALL THIS BUT ASSERTION, AND YOU SHALL HAVE PROOF."

"INDEED, MY DEAR MRS SMITH, I WANT NONE," CRIED ANNE.  "YOU HAVE ASSERTED
NOTHING CONTRADICTORY TO WHAT MR ELLIOT APPEARED TO BE SOME YEARS AGO.
THIS IS ALL IN CONFIRMATION, RATHER, OF WHAT WE USED TO HEAR AND BELIEVE.
I AM MORE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHY HE SHOULD BE SO DIFFERENT NOW."

"BUT FOR MY SATISFACTION, IF YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO RING FOR MARY;
STAY:  I AM SURE YOU WILL HAVE THE STILL GREATER GOODNESS OF
GOING YOURSELF INTO MY BEDROOM, AND BRINGING ME THE SMALL INLAID BOX
WHICH YOU WILL FIND ON THE UPPER SHELF OF THE CLOSET."

ANNE, SEEING HER FRIEND TO BE EARNESTLY BENT ON IT, DID AS SHE WAS DESIRED.
THE BOX WAS BROUGHT AND PLACED BEFORE HER, AND MRS SMITH, SIGHING OVER IT
AS SHE UNLOCKED IT, SAID--

"THIS IS FULL OF PAPERS BELONGING TO HIM, TO MY HUSBAND;
A SMALL PORTION ONLY OF WHAT I HAD TO LOOK OVER WHEN I LOST HIM.
THE LETTER I AM LOOKING FOR WAS ONE WRITTEN BY MR ELLIOT TO HIM
BEFORE OUR MARRIAGE, AND HAPPENED TO BE SAVED; WHY, ONE CAN HARDLY IMAGINE.
BUT HE WAS CARELESS AND IMMETHODICAL, LIKE OTHER MEN, ABOUT THOSE THINGS;
AND WHEN I CAME TO EXAMINE HIS PAPERS, I FOUND IT WITH OTHERS
STILL MORE TRIVIAL, FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE SCATTERED HERE AND THERE,
WHILE MANY LETTERS AND MEMORANDUMS OF REAL IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN DESTROYED.
HERE IT IS; I WOULD NOT BURN IT, BECAUSE BEING EVEN THEN VERY LITTLE
SATISFIED WITH MR ELLIOT, I WAS DETERMINED TO PRESERVE EVERY DOCUMENT
OF FORMER INTIMACY.  I HAVE NOW ANOTHER MOTIVE FOR BEING GLAD
THAT I CAN PRODUCE IT."

THIS WAS THE LETTER, DIRECTED TO "CHARLES SMITH, ESQ. TUNBRIDGE WELLS,"
AND DATED FROM LONDON, AS FAR BACK AS JULY, 1803: --

"DEAR SMITH,--I HAVE RECEIVED YOURS.  YOUR KINDNESS ALMOST OVERPOWERS ME.
I WISH NATURE HAD MADE SUCH HEARTS AS YOURS MORE COMMON, BUT I HAVE
LIVED THREE-AND-TWENTY YEARS IN THE WORLD, AND HAVE SEEN NONE LIKE IT.
AT PRESENT, BELIEVE ME, I HAVE NO NEED OF YOUR SERVICES,
BEING IN CASH AGAIN.  GIVE ME JOY:  I HAVE GOT RID OF SIR WALTER AND MISS.
THEY ARE GONE BACK TO KELLYNCH, AND ALMOST MADE ME SWEAR TO VISIT THEM
THIS SUMMER; BUT MY FIRST VISIT TO KELLYNCH WILL BE WITH A SURVEYOR,
TO TELL ME HOW TO BRING IT WITH BEST ADVANTAGE TO THE HAMMER.
THE BARONET, NEVERTHELESS, IS NOT UNLIKELY TO MARRY AGAIN;
HE IS QUITE FOOL ENOUGH.  IF HE DOES, HOWEVER, THEY WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE,
WHICH MAY BE A DECENT EQUIVALENT  FOR THE REVERSION.  HE IS WORSE
THAN LAST YEAR.

"I WISH I HAD ANY NAME BUT ELLIOT.  I AM SICK OF IT.  THE NAME OF WALTER
I CAN DROP, THANK GOD! AND I DESIRE YOU WILL NEVER INSULT ME
WITH MY SECOND W. AGAIN, MEANING, FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
TO BE ONLY YOURS TRULY,--WM. ELLIOT."

SUCH A LETTER COULD NOT BE READ WITHOUT PUTTING ANNE IN A GLOW;
AND MRS SMITH, OBSERVING THE HIGH COLOUR IN HER FACE, SAID--

"THE LANGUAGE, I KNOW, IS HIGHLY DISRESPECTFUL.  THOUGH I HAVE FORGOT
THE EXACT TERMS, I HAVE A PERFECT IMPRESSION OF THE GENERAL MEANING.
BUT IT SHOWS YOU THE MAN.  MARK HIS PROFESSIONS TO MY POOR HUSBAND.
CAN ANY THING BE STRONGER?"

ANNE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY GET OVER THE SHOCK AND MORTIFICATION
OF FINDING SUCH WORDS APPLIED TO HER FATHER.  SHE WAS OBLIGED TO RECOLLECT
THAT HER SEEING THE LETTER WAS A VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF HONOUR,
THAT NO ONE OUGHT TO BE JUDGED OR TO BE KNOWN BY SUCH TESTIMONIES,
THAT NO PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE COULD BEAR THE EYE OF OTHERS,
BEFORE SHE COULD RECOVER CALMNESS ENOUGH TO RETURN THE LETTER
WHICH SHE HAD BEEN MEDITATING OVER, AND SAY--

"THANK YOU.  THIS IS FULL PROOF UNDOUBTEDLY; PROOF OF EVERY THING
YOU WERE SAYING.  BUT WHY BE ACQUAINTED WITH US NOW?"

"I CAN EXPLAIN THIS TOO," CRIED MRS SMITH, SMILING.

"CAN YOU REALLY?"

"YES.  I HAVE SHEWN YOU MR ELLIOT AS HE WAS A DOZEN YEARS AGO,
AND I WILL SHEW HIM AS HE IS NOW.  I CANNOT PRODUCE WRITTEN PROOF AGAIN,
BUT I CAN GIVE AS AUTHENTIC ORAL TESTIMONY AS YOU CAN DESIRE, OF WHAT
HE IS NOW WANTING, AND WHAT HE IS NOW DOING.  HE IS NO HYPOCRITE NOW.
HE TRULY WANTS TO MARRY YOU.  HIS PRESENT ATTENTIONS TO YOUR FAMILY
ARE VERY SINCERE:  QUITE FROM THE HEART.  I WILL GIVE YOU MY AUTHORITY:
HIS FRIEND COLONEL WALLIS."

"COLONEL WALLIS! YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM?"

"NO.  IT DOES NOT COME TO ME IN QUITE SO DIRECT A LINE AS THAT;
IT TAKES A BEND OR TWO, BUT NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE.  THE STREAM
IS AS GOOD AS AT FIRST; THE LITTLE RUBBISH IT COLLECTS IN THE TURNINGS
IS EASILY MOVED AWAY.  MR ELLIOT TALKS UNRESERVEDLY TO COLONEL WALLIS
OF HIS VIEWS ON YOU, WHICH SAID COLONEL WALLIS, I IMAGINE TO BE,
IN HIMSELF, A SENSIBLE, CAREFUL, DISCERNING SORT OF CHARACTER;
BUT COLONEL WALLIS HAS A VERY PRETTY SILLY WIFE, TO WHOM
HE TELLS THINGS WHICH HE HAD BETTER NOT, AND HE REPEATS IT ALL TO HER.
SHE IN THE OVERFLOWING SPIRITS OF HER RECOVERY, REPEATS IT ALL
TO HER NURSE; AND THE NURSE  KNOWING MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU,
VERY NATURALLY BRINGS IT ALL TO ME.  ON MONDAY EVENING, MY GOOD FRIEND
MRS ROOKE LET ME THUS MUCH INTO THE SECRETS OF MARLBOROUGH BUILDINGS.
WHEN I TALKED OF A WHOLE HISTORY, THEREFORE, YOU SEE I WAS
NOT ROMANCING SO MUCH AS YOU SUPPOSED."

"MY DEAR MRS SMITH, YOUR AUTHORITY IS DEFICIENT.  THIS WILL NOT DO.
MR ELLIOT'S HAVING ANY VIEWS ON ME WILL NOT IN THE LEAST ACCOUNT
FOR THE EFFORTS HE MADE TOWARDS A RECONCILIATION WITH MY FATHER.
THAT WAS ALL PRIOR TO MY COMING TO BATH.  I FOUND THEM ON
THE MOST FRIENDLY TERMS WHEN I ARRIVED."

"I KNOW YOU DID; I KNOW IT ALL PERFECTLY, BUT--"

"INDEED, MRS SMITH, WE MUST NOT EXPECT TO GET REAL INFORMATION
IN SUCH A LINE.  FACTS OR OPINIONS WHICH ARE TO PASS THROUGH THE HANDS
OF SO MANY, TO BE MISCONCEIVED BY FOLLY IN ONE, AND IGNORANCE IN ANOTHER,
CAN HARDLY HAVE MUCH TRUTH LEFT."

"ONLY GIVE ME A HEARING.  YOU WILL SOON BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF
THE GENERAL CREDIT DUE, BY LISTENING TO SOME PARTICULARS
WHICH YOU CAN YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY CONTRADICT OR CONFIRM.
NOBODY SUPPOSES THAT YOU WERE HIS FIRST INDUCEMENT.  HE HAD SEEN YOU
INDEED, BEFORE HE CAME TO BATH, AND ADMIRED YOU, BUT WITHOUT
KNOWING IT TO BE YOU.  SO SAYS MY HISTORIAN, AT LEAST.  IS THIS TRUE?
DID HE SEE YOU LAST SUMMER OR AUTUMN, `SOMEWHERE DOWN IN THE WEST,'
TO USE HER OWN WORDS, WITHOUT KNOWING IT TO BE YOU?"

"HE CERTAINLY DID.  SO FAR IT IS VERY TRUE.  AT LYME.
I HAPPENED TO BE AT LYME."

"WELL," CONTINUED MRS SMITH, TRIUMPHANTLY, "GRANT MY FRIEND THE CREDIT
DUE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST POINT ASSERTED.  HE SAW YOU THEN
AT LYME, AND LIKED YOU SO WELL AS TO BE EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED
TO MEET WITH YOU AGAIN IN CAMDEN PLACE, AS MISS ANNE ELLIOT,
AND FROM THAT MOMENT, I HAVE NO DOUBT, HAD A DOUBLE MOTIVE
IN HIS VISITS THERE.  BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER, AND AN EARLIER,
WHICH I WILL NOW EXPLAIN.  IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN MY STORY WHICH YOU KNOW
TO BE EITHER FALSE OR IMPROBABLE, STOP ME.  MY ACCOUNT STATES,
THAT YOUR SISTER'S FRIEND, THE LADY NOW STAYING WITH YOU,
WHOM I HAVE HEARD YOU MENTION, CAME TO BATH WITH MISS ELLIOT AND SIR WALTER
AS LONG AGO AS SEPTEMBER (IN SHORT WHEN THEY FIRST CAME THEMSELVES),
AND HAS BEEN STAYING THERE EVER SINCE; THAT SHE IS A CLEVER, INSINUATING,
HANDSOME WOMAN, POOR AND PLAUSIBLE, AND ALTOGETHER SUCH IN SITUATION
AND MANNER, AS TO GIVE A GENERAL IDEA, AMONG SIR WALTER'S ACQUAINTANCE,
OF HER MEANING TO BE LADY ELLIOT, AND AS GENERAL A SURPRISE
THAT MISS ELLIOT SHOULD BE APPARENTLY, BLIND TO THE DANGER."

HERE MRS SMITH PAUSED A MOMENT; BUT ANNE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY,
AND SHE CONTINUED--

"THIS WAS THE LIGHT IN WHICH IT APPEARED TO THOSE WHO KNEW THE FAMILY,
LONG BEFORE YOU RETURNED TO IT; AND COLONEL WALLIS HAD HIS EYE
UPON YOUR FATHER ENOUGH TO BE SENSIBLE OF IT, THOUGH HE DID NOT THEN
VISIT IN CAMDEN PLACE; BUT HIS REGARD FOR MR ELLIOT GAVE HIM AN INTEREST
IN WATCHING ALL THAT WAS GOING ON THERE, AND WHEN MR ELLIOT CAME TO BATH
FOR A DAY OR TWO, AS HE HAPPENED TO DO A LITTLE BEFORE CHRISTMAS,
COLONEL WALLIS MADE HIM ACQUAINTED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS,
AND THE REPORTS BEGINNING TO PREVAIL.  NOW YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND,
THAT TIME HAD WORKED A VERY MATERIAL CHANGE IN MR ELLIOT'S OPINIONS
AS TO THE VALUE OF A BARONETCY.  UPON ALL POINTS OF BLOOD AND CONNEXION
HE IS A COMPLETELY ALTERED MAN.  HAVING LONG HAD AS MUCH MONEY
AS HE COULD SPEND, NOTHING TO WISH FOR ON THE SIDE OF AVARICE
OR INDULGENCE, HE HAS BEEN GRADUALLY LEARNING TO PIN HIS HAPPINESS
UPON THE CONSEQUENCE HE IS HEIR TO.  I THOUGHT IT COMING ON
BEFORE OUR ACQUAINTANCE CEASED, BUT IT IS NOW A CONFIRMED FEELING.
HE CANNOT BEAR THE IDEA OF NOT BEING SIR WILLIAM.  YOU MAY GUESS,
THEREFORE, THAT THE NEWS HE HEARD FROM HIS FRIEND COULD NOT BE
VERY AGREEABLE, AND YOU MAY GUESS WHAT IT PRODUCED; THE RESOLUTION
OF COMING BACK TO BATH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND OF FIXING HIMSELF HERE
FOR A TIME, WITH THE VIEW OF RENEWING HIS FORMER ACQUAINTANCE,
AND RECOVERING SUCH A FOOTING IN THE FAMILY AS MIGHT GIVE HIM THE MEANS
OF ASCERTAINING THE DEGREE OF HIS DANGER, AND OF CIRCUMVENTING THE LADY
IF HE FOUND IT MATERIAL.  THIS WAS AGREED UPON BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS
AS THE ONLY THING TO BE DONE; AND COLONEL WALLIS WAS TO ASSIST
IN EVERY WAY THAT HE COULD.  HE WAS TO BE INTRODUCED, AND MRS WALLIS
WAS TO BE INTRODUCED, AND EVERYBODY WAS TO BE INTRODUCED.
MR ELLIOT CAME BACK ACCORDINGLY; AND ON APPLICATION WAS FORGIVEN,
AS YOU KNOW, AND RE-ADMITTED INTO THE FAMILY; AND THERE IT WAS
HIS CONSTANT OBJECT, AND HIS ONLY OBJECT (TILL YOUR ARRIVAL
ADDED ANOTHER MOTIVE), TO WATCH SIR WALTER AND MRS CLAY.
HE OMITTED NO OPPORTUNITY OF BEING WITH THEM, THREW HIMSELF IN THEIR WAY,
CALLED AT ALL HOURS; BUT I NEED NOT BE PARTICULAR ON THIS SUBJECT.
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT AN ARTFUL MAN WOULD DO; AND WITH THIS GUIDE,
PERHAPS, MAY RECOLLECT WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN HIM DO."

"YES," SAID ANNE, "YOU TELL ME NOTHING WHICH DOES NOT ACCORD WITH
WHAT I HAVE KNOWN, OR COULD IMAGINE.  THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING OFFENSIVE
IN THE DETAILS OF CUNNING.  THE MANOEUVRES OF SELFISHNESS AND DUPLICITY
MUST EVER BE REVOLTING, BUT I HAVE HEARD NOTHING WHICH REALLY SURPRISES ME.
I KNOW THOSE WHO WOULD BE SHOCKED BY SUCH A REPRESENTATION OF MR ELLIOT,
WHO WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING IT; BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN SATISFIED.
I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED SOME OTHER MOTIVE FOR HIS CONDUCT THAN APPEARED.
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HIS PRESENT OPINION, AS TO THE PROBABILITY
OF THE EVENT HE HAS BEEN IN DREAD OF; WHETHER HE CONSIDERS THE DANGER
TO BE LESSENING OR NOT."

"LESSENING, I UNDERSTAND," REPLIED MRS SMITH.  "HE THINKS MRS CLAY
AFRAID OF HIM, AWARE THAT HE SEES THROUGH HER, AND NOT DARING TO PROCEED
AS SHE MIGHT DO IN HIS ABSENCE.  BUT SINCE HE MUST BE ABSENT
SOME TIME OR OTHER, I DO NOT PERCEIVE HOW HE CAN EVER BE SECURE
WHILE SHE HOLDS HER PRESENT INFLUENCE.  MRS WALLIS HAS AN AMUSING IDEA,
AS NURSE TELLS ME, THAT IT IS TO BE PUT INTO THE MARRIAGE ARTICLES
WHEN YOU AND MR ELLIOT MARRY, THAT YOUR FATHER IS NOT TO MARRY MRS CLAY.
A SCHEME, WORTHY OF MRS WALLIS'S UNDERSTANDING, BY ALL ACCOUNTS;
BUT MY SENSIBLE NURSE ROOKE SEES THE ABSURDITY OF IT.  `WHY, TO BE SURE,
MA'AM,' SAID SHE, `IT WOULD NOT PREVENT HIS MARRYING ANYBODY ELSE.'
AND, INDEED, TO OWN THE TRUTH, I DO NOT THINK NURSE, IN HER HEART,
IS A VERY STRENUOUS OPPOSER OF SIR WALTER'S MAKING A SECOND MATCH.
SHE MUST BE ALLOWED TO BE A FAVOURER OF MATRIMONY, YOU KNOW;
AND (SINCE SELF WILL INTRUDE) WHO CAN SAY THAT SHE MAY NOT HAVE
SOME FLYING VISIONS OF ATTENDING THE NEXT LADY ELLIOT, THROUGH
MRS WALLIS'S RECOMMENDATION?"

"I AM VERY GLAD TO KNOW ALL THIS," SAID ANNE, AFTER A LITTLE
THOUGHTFULNESS.  "IT WILL BE MORE PAINFUL TO ME IN SOME RESPECTS
TO BE IN COMPANY WITH HIM, BUT I SHALL KNOW BETTER WHAT TO DO.
MY LINE OF CONDUCT WILL BE MORE DIRECT.  MR ELLIOT IS EVIDENTLY
A DISINGENUOUS, ARTIFICIAL, WORLDLY MAN, WHO HAS NEVER HAD
ANY BETTER PRINCIPLE TO GUIDE HIM THAN SELFISHNESS."

BUT MR ELLIOT WAS NOT DONE WITH.  MRS SMITH HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY
FROM HER FIRST DIRECTION, AND ANNE HAD FORGOTTEN, IN THE INTEREST
OF HER OWN FAMILY CONCERNS, HOW MUCH HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY IMPLIED
AGAINST HIM; BUT HER ATTENTION WAS NOW CALLED TO THE EXPLANATION
OF THOSE FIRST HINTS, AND SHE LISTENED TO A RECITAL WHICH,
IF IT DID NOT PERFECTLY JUSTIFY THE UNQUALIFIED BITTERNESS OF MRS SMITH,
PROVED HIM TO HAVE BEEN VERY UNFEELING IN HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS HER;
VERY DEFICIENT BOTH IN JUSTICE AND COMPASSION.

SHE LEARNED THAT (THE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM CONTINUING UNIMPAIRED
BY MR ELLIOT'S MARRIAGE) THEY HAD BEEN AS BEFORE ALWAYS TOGETHER,
AND MR ELLIOT HAD LED HIS FRIEND INTO EXPENSES MUCH BEYOND HIS FORTUNE.
MRS SMITH DID NOT WANT TO TAKE BLAME TO HERSELF, AND WAS MOST TENDER
OF THROWING ANY ON HER HUSBAND; BUT ANNE COULD COLLECT THAT THEIR INCOME
HAD NEVER BEEN EQUAL TO THEIR STYLE OF LIVING, AND THAT FROM THE FIRST
THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF GENERAL AND JOINT EXTRAVAGANCE.
FROM HIS WIFE'S ACCOUNT OF HIM SHE COULD DISCERN MR SMITH TO HAVE BEEN
A MAN OF WARM FEELINGS, EASY TEMPER, CARELESS HABITS, AND NOT STRONG
UNDERSTANDING, MUCH MORE AMIABLE THAN HIS FRIEND, AND VERY UNLIKE HIM,
LED BY HIM, AND PROBABLY DESPISED BY HIM.  MR ELLIOT, RAISED BY
HIS MARRIAGE TO GREAT AFFLUENCE, AND DISPOSED TO EVERY GRATIFICATION
OF PLEASURE AND VANITY WHICH COULD BE COMMANDED WITHOUT INVOLVING HIMSELF,
(FOR WITH ALL HIS SELF-INDULGENCE HE HAD BECOME A PRUDENT MAN),
AND BEGINNING TO BE RICH, JUST AS HIS FRIEND OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND HIMSELF
TO BE POOR, SEEMED TO HAVE HAD NO CONCERN AT ALL FOR THAT FRIEND'S
PROBABLE FINANCES, BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, HAD BEEN PROMPTING AND
ENCOURAGING EXPENSES WHICH COULD END ONLY IN RUIN; AND THE SMITHS
ACCORDINGLY HAD BEEN RUINED.

THE HUSBAND HAD DIED JUST IN TIME TO BE SPARED THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF IT.
THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY KNOWN EMBARRASSMENTS ENOUGH TO TRY THE FRIENDSHIP
OF THEIR FRIENDS, AND TO PROVE THAT MR ELLIOT'S HAD BETTER NOT BE TRIED;
BUT IT WAS NOT TILL HIS DEATH THAT THE WRETCHED STATE OF HIS AFFAIRS
WAS FULLY KNOWN.  WITH A CONFIDENCE IN MR ELLIOT'S REGARD,
MORE CREDITABLE TO HIS FEELINGS THAN HIS JUDGEMENT, MR SMITH HAD
APPOINTED HIM THE EXECUTOR OF HIS WILL; BUT MR ELLIOT WOULD NOT ACT,
AND THE DIFFICULTIES AND DISTRESS WHICH THIS REFUSAL HAD HEAPED ON HER,
IN ADDITION TO THE INEVITABLE SUFFERINGS OF HER SITUATION, HAD BEEN SUCH
AS COULD NOT BE RELATED WITHOUT ANGUISH OF SPIRIT, OR LISTENED TO
WITHOUT CORRESPONDING INDIGNATION.

ANNE WAS SHEWN SOME LETTERS OF HIS ON THE OCCASION, ANSWERS TO
URGENT APPLICATIONS FROM MRS SMITH, WHICH ALL BREATHED THE SAME
STERN RESOLUTION OF NOT ENGAGING IN A FRUITLESS TROUBLE, AND,
UNDER A COLD CIVILITY, THE SAME HARD-HEARTED INDIFFERENCE
TO ANY OF THE EVILS IT MIGHT BRING ON HER.  IT WAS A DREADFUL PICTURE
OF INGRATITUDE AND INHUMANITY; AND ANNE FELT, AT SOME MOMENTS,
THAT NO FLAGRANT OPEN CRIME COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.  SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL
TO LISTEN TO; ALL THE PARTICULARS OF PAST SAD SCENES, ALL THE MINUTIAE
OF DISTRESS UPON DISTRESS, WHICH IN FORMER CONVERSATIONS HAD BEEN
MERELY HINTED AT, WERE DWELT ON NOW WITH A NATURAL INDULGENCE.
ANNE COULD PERFECTLY COMPREHEND THE EXQUISITE RELIEF, AND WAS ONLY
THE MORE INCLINED TO WONDER AT THE COMPOSURE OF HER FRIEND'S
USUAL STATE OF MIND.

THERE WAS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF HER GRIEVANCES
OF PARTICULAR IRRITATION.  SHE HAD GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT
SOME PROPERTY OF HER HUSBAND IN THE WEST INDIES, WHICH HAD BEEN
FOR MANY YEARS UNDER A SORT OF SEQUESTRATION FOR THE PAYMENT
OF ITS OWN INCUMBRANCES, MIGHT BE RECOVERABLE BY PROPER MEASURES;
AND THIS PROPERTY, THOUGH NOT LARGE, WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE
HER COMPARATIVELY RICH.  BUT THERE WAS NOBODY TO STIR IN IT.
MR ELLIOT WOULD DO NOTHING, AND SHE COULD DO NOTHING HERSELF,
EQUALLY DISABLED FROM PERSONAL EXERTION BY HER STATE OF
BODILY WEAKNESS, AND FROM EMPLOYING OTHERS BY HER WANT OF MONEY.
SHE HAD NO NATURAL CONNEXIONS TO ASSIST HER EVEN WITH THEIR COUNSEL,
AND SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO PURCHASE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE LAW.
THIS WAS A CRUEL AGGRAVATION OF ACTUALLY STRAITENED MEANS.
TO FEEL THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE IN BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES,
THAT A LITTLE TROUBLE IN THE RIGHT PLACE MIGHT DO IT,
AND TO FEAR THAT DELAY MIGHT BE EVEN WEAKENING HER CLAIMS,
WAS HARD TO BEAR.

IT WAS ON THIS POINT THAT SHE HAD HOPED TO ENGAGE ANNE'S GOOD OFFICES
WITH MR ELLIOT.  SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY, IN THE ANTICIPATION
OF THEIR MARRIAGE, BEEN VERY APPREHENSIVE OF LOSING HER FRIEND BY IT;
BUT ON BEING ASSURED THAT HE COULD HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT OF THAT NATURE,
SINCE HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW HER TO BE IN BATH, IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED,
THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE DONE IN HER FAVOUR BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE WOMAN
HE LOVED, AND SHE HAD BEEN HASTILY PREPARING TO INTEREST ANNE'S FEELINGS,
AS FAR AS THE OBSERVANCES DUE TO MR ELLIOT'S CHARACTER WOULD ALLOW,
WHEN ANNE'S REFUTATION OF THE SUPPOSED ENGAGEMENT CHANGED
THE FACE OF EVERYTHING; AND WHILE IT TOOK FROM HER THE NEW-FORMED HOPE
OF SUCCEEDING IN THE OBJECT OF HER FIRST ANXIETY, LEFT HER AT LEAST
THE COMFORT OF TELLING THE WHOLE STORY HER OWN WAY.

AFTER LISTENING TO THIS FULL DESCRIPTION OF MR ELLIOT, ANNE COULD NOT BUT
EXPRESS SOME SURPRISE AT MRS SMITH'S HAVING SPOKEN OF HIM SO FAVOURABLY
IN THE BEGINNING OF THEIR CONVERSATION.  "SHE HAD SEEMED TO RECOMMEND
AND PRAISE HIM!"

"MY DEAR," WAS MRS SMITH'S REPLY, "THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE.
I CONSIDERED YOUR MARRYING HIM AS CERTAIN, THOUGH HE MIGHT NOT YET
HAVE MADE THE OFFER, AND I COULD NO MORE SPEAK THE TRUTH OF HIM,
THAN IF HE HAD BEEN YOUR HUSBAND.  MY HEART BLED FOR YOU,
AS I TALKED OF HAPPINESS; AND YET HE IS SENSIBLE, HE IS AGREEABLE,
AND WITH SUCH A WOMAN AS YOU, IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS.
HE WAS VERY UNKIND TO HIS FIRST WIFE.  THEY WERE WRETCHED TOGETHER.
BUT SHE WAS TOO IGNORANT AND GIDDY FOR RESPECT, AND HE HAD NEVER LOVED HER.
I WAS WILLING TO HOPE THAT YOU MUST FARE BETTER."

ANNE COULD JUST ACKNOWLEDGE WITHIN HERSELF SUCH A POSSIBILITY
OF HAVING BEEN INDUCED TO MARRY HIM, AS MADE HER SHUDDER AT THE IDEA
OF THE MISERY WHICH MUST HAVE FOLLOWED.  IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERSUADED BY LADY RUSSELL!  AND UNDER SUCH
A SUPPOSITION, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST MISERABLE, WHEN TIME HAD
DISCLOSED ALL, TOO LATE?

IT WAS VERY DESIRABLE THAT LADY RUSSELL SHOULD BE NO LONGER DECEIVED;
AND ONE OF THE CONCLUDING ARRANGEMENTS OF THIS IMPORTANT CONFERENCE,
WHICH CARRIED THEM THROUGH THE GREATER PART OF THE MORNING,
WAS, THAT ANNE HAD FULL LIBERTY TO COMMUNICATE TO HER FRIEND
EVERYTHING RELATIVE TO MRS SMITH, IN WHICH HIS CONDUCT WAS INVOLVED.



CHAPTER 22


ANNE WENT HOME TO THINK OVER ALL THAT SHE HAD HEARD.  IN ONE POINT,
HER FEELINGS WERE RELIEVED BY THIS KNOWLEDGE OF MR ELLIOT.
THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING OF TENDERNESS DUE TO HIM.  HE STOOD AS
OPPOSED TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IN ALL HIS OWN UNWELCOME OBTRUSIVENESS;
AND THE EVIL OF HIS ATTENTIONS LAST NIGHT, THE IRREMEDIABLE MISCHIEF
HE MIGHT HAVE DONE, WAS CONSIDERED WITH SENSATIONS UNQUALIFIED, UNPERPLEXED.
PITY FOR HIM WAS ALL OVER.  BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY POINT OF RELIEF.
IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT, IN LOOKING AROUND HER, OR PENETRATING FORWARD,
SHE SAW MORE TO DISTRUST AND TO APPREHEND.  SHE WAS CONCERNED
FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT AND PAIN LADY RUSSELL WOULD BE FEELING;
FOR THE MORTIFICATIONS WHICH MUST BE HANGING OVER HER FATHER AND SISTER,
AND HAD ALL THE DISTRESS OF FORESEEING MANY EVILS, WITHOUT KNOWING
HOW TO AVERT ANY ONE OF THEM.  SHE WAS MOST THANKFUL FOR HER OWN
KNOWLEDGE OF HIM.  SHE HAD NEVER CONSIDERED HERSELF AS ENTITLED TO REWARD
FOR NOT SLIGHTING AN OLD FRIEND LIKE MRS SMITH, BUT HERE WAS
A REWARD INDEED SPRINGING FROM IT!  MRS SMITH HAD BEEN ABLE TO TELL HER
WHAT NO ONE ELSE COULD HAVE DONE.  COULD THE KNOWLEDGE HAVE
BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH HER FAMILY?  BUT THIS WAS A VAIN IDEA.
SHE MUST TALK TO LADY RUSSELL, TELL HER, CONSULT WITH HER,
AND HAVING DONE HER BEST, WAIT THE EVENT WITH AS MUCH COMPOSURE
AS POSSIBLE; AND AFTER ALL, HER GREATEST WANT OF COMPOSURE WOULD BE
IN THAT QUARTER OF THE MIND WHICH COULD NOT BE OPENED TO LADY RUSSELL;
IN THAT FLOW OF ANXIETIES AND FEARS WHICH MUST BE ALL TO HERSELF.


SHE FOUND, ON REACHING HOME, THAT SHE HAD, AS SHE INTENDED,
ESCAPED SEEING MR ELLIOT; THAT HE HAD CALLED AND PAID THEM
A LONG MORNING VISIT; BUT HARDLY HAD SHE CONGRATULATED HERSELF,
AND FELT SAFE, WHEN SHE HEARD THAT HE WAS COMING AGAIN IN THE EVENING.

"I HAD NOT THE SMALLEST INTENTION OF ASKING HIM," SAID ELIZABETH,
WITH AFFECTED CARELESSNESS, "BUT HE GAVE SO MANY HINTS;
SO MRS CLAY SAYS, AT LEAST."

"INDEED, I DO SAY IT.  I NEVER SAW ANYBODY IN MY LIFE SPELL HARDER
FOR AN INVITATION.  POOR MAN!  I WAS REALLY IN PAIN FOR HIM;
FOR YOUR HARD-HEARTED SISTER, MISS ANNE, SEEMS BENT ON CRUELTY."

"OH!" CRIED ELIZABETH, "I HAVE BEEN RATHER TOO MUCH USED TO THE GAME
TO BE SOON OVERCOME BY A GENTLEMAN'S HINTS.  HOWEVER, WHEN I FOUND
HOW EXCESSIVELY HE WAS REGRETTING THAT HE SHOULD MISS MY FATHER
THIS MORNING, I GAVE WAY IMMEDIATELY, FOR I WOULD NEVER REALLY OMIT
AN OPPORTUNITY OF BRING HIM AND SIR WALTER TOGETHER.  THEY APPEAR TO
SO MUCH ADVANTAGE IN COMPANY WITH EACH OTHER.  EACH BEHAVING SO PLEASANTLY.
MR ELLIOT LOOKING UP WITH SO MUCH RESPECT."

"QUITE DELIGHTFUL!" CRIED MRS CLAY, NOT DARING, HOWEVER,
TO TURN HER EYES TOWARDS ANNE.  "EXACTLY LIKE FATHER AND SON!
DEAR MISS ELLIOT, MAY I NOT SAY FATHER AND SON?"

"OH! I LAY NO EMBARGO ON ANY BODY'S WORDS.  IF YOU WILL HAVE SUCH
IDEAS!  BUT, UPON MY WORD, I AM SCARCELY SENSIBLE OF HIS ATTENTIONS
BEING BEYOND THOSE OF OTHER MEN."

"MY DEAR MISS ELLIOT!" EXCLAIMED MRS CLAY, LIFTING HER HANDS AND EYES,
AND SINKING ALL THE REST OF HER ASTONISHMENT IN A CONVENIENT SILENCE.

"WELL, MY DEAR PENELOPE, YOU NEED NOT BE SO ALARMED ABOUT HIM.
I DID INVITE HIM, YOU KNOW.  I SENT HIM AWAY WITH SMILES.
WHEN I FOUND HE WAS REALLY GOING TO HIS FRIENDS AT THORNBERRY PARK
FOR THE WHOLE DAY TO-MORROW, I HAD COMPASSION ON HIM."

ANNE ADMIRED THE GOOD ACTING OF THE FRIEND, IN BEING ABLE TO SHEW
SUCH PLEASURE AS SHE DID, IN THE EXPECTATION AND IN THE ACTUAL ARRIVAL
OF THE VERY PERSON WHOSE PRESENCE MUST REALLY BE INTERFERING WITH
HER PRIME OBJECT.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT MRS CLAY MUST HATE
THE SIGHT OF MR ELLIOT; AND YET SHE COULD ASSUME A MOST OBLIGING,
PLACID LOOK, AND APPEAR QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE CURTAILED LICENSE
OF DEVOTING HERSELF ONLY HALF AS MUCH TO SIR WALTER AS SHE WOULD HAVE
DONE OTHERWISE.

TO ANNE HERSELF IT WAS MOST DISTRESSING TO SEE MR ELLIOT ENTER THE ROOM;
AND QUITE PAINFUL TO HAVE HIM APPROACH AND SPEAK TO HER.
SHE HAD BEEN USED BEFORE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NOT BE ALWAYS QUITE SINCERE,
BUT NOW SHE SAW INSINCERITY IN EVERYTHING.  HIS ATTENTIVE DEFERENCE
TO HER FATHER, CONTRASTED WITH HIS FORMER LANGUAGE, WAS ODIOUS;
AND WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF HIS CRUEL CONDUCT TOWARDS MRS SMITH,
SHE COULD HARDLY BEAR THE SIGHT OF HIS PRESENT SMILES AND MILDNESS,
OR THE SOUND OF HIS ARTIFICIAL GOOD SENTIMENTS.

SHE MEANT TO AVOID ANY SUCH ALTERATION OF MANNERS AS MIGHT PROVOKE
A REMONSTRANCE ON HIS SIDE.  IT WAS A GREAT OBJECT TO HER TO ESCAPE
ALL ENQUIRY OR ECLAT; BUT IT WAS HER INTENTION TO BE AS DECIDEDLY COOL
TO HIM AS MIGHT BE COMPATIBLE WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP; AND TO RETRACE,
AS QUIETLY AS SHE COULD, THE FEW STEPS OF UNNECESSARY INTIMACY SHE HAD
BEEN GRADUALLY LED ALONG.  SHE WAS ACCORDINGLY MORE GUARDED,
AND MORE COOL, THAN SHE HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE.

HE WANTED TO ANIMATE HER CURIOSITY AGAIN AS TO HOW AND WHERE
HE COULD HAVE HEARD HER FORMERLY PRAISED; WANTED VERY MUCH
TO BE GRATIFIED BY MORE SOLICITATION; BUT THE CHARM WAS BROKEN:
HE FOUND THAT THE HEAT AND ANIMATION OF A PUBLIC ROOM WAS NECESSARY
TO KINDLE HIS MODEST COUSIN'S VANITY; HE FOUND, AT LEAST, THAT IT WAS
NOT TO BE DONE NOW, BY ANY OF THOSE ATTEMPTS WHICH HE COULD HAZARD
AMONG THE TOO-COMMANDING CLAIMS OF THE OTHERS.  HE LITTLE SURMISED
THAT IT WAS A SUBJECT ACTING NOW EXACTLY AGAINST HIS INTEREST,
BRINGING IMMEDIATELY TO HER THOUGHTS ALL THOSE PARTS OF HIS CONDUCT
WHICH WERE LEAST EXCUSABLE.

SHE HAD SOME SATISFACTION IN FINDING THAT HE WAS REALLY GOING OUT OF BATH
THE NEXT MORNING, GOING EARLY, AND THAT HE WOULD BE GONE THE GREATER PART
OF TWO DAYS.  HE WAS INVITED AGAIN TO CAMDEN PLACE THE VERY EVENING OF
HIS RETURN; BUT FROM THURSDAY TO SATURDAY EVENING HIS ABSENCE WAS CERTAIN.
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH THAT A MRS CLAY SHOULD BE ALWAYS BEFORE HER;
BUT THAT A DEEPER HYPOCRITE SHOULD BE ADDED TO THEIR PARTY,
SEEMED THE DESTRUCTION OF EVERYTHING LIKE PEACE AND COMFORT.
IT WAS SO HUMILIATING TO REFLECT ON THE CONSTANT DECEPTION PRACTISED
ON HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH; TO CONSIDER THE VARIOUS SOURCES
OF MORTIFICATION PREPARING FOR THEM!  MRS CLAY'S SELFISHNESS WAS
NOT SO COMPLICATE NOR SO REVOLTING AS HIS; AND ANNE WOULD HAVE COMPOUNDED
FOR THE MARRIAGE AT ONCE, WITH ALL ITS EVILS, TO BE CLEAR OF MR ELLIOT'S
SUBTLETIES IN ENDEAVOURING TO PREVENT IT.

ON FRIDAY MORNING SHE MEANT TO GO VERY EARLY TO LADY RUSSELL,
AND ACCOMPLISH THE NECESSARY COMMUNICATION; AND SHE WOULD HAVE GONE
DIRECTLY AFTER BREAKFAST, BUT THAT MRS CLAY WAS ALSO GOING OUT
ON SOME OBLIGING PURPOSE OF SAVING HER SISTER TROUBLE, WHICH
DETERMINED HER TO WAIT TILL SHE MIGHT BE SAFE FROM SUCH A COMPANION.
SHE SAW MRS CLAY FAIRLY OFF, THEREFORE, BEFORE SHE BEGAN TO TALK
OF SPENDING THE MORNING IN RIVERS STREET.

"VERY WELL," SAID ELIZABETH, "I HAVE NOTHING TO SEND BUT MY LOVE.
OH! YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE BACK THAT TIRESOME BOOK SHE WOULD LEND ME,
AND PRETEND I HAVE READ IT THROUGH.  I REALLY CANNOT BE PLAGUING MYSELF
FOR EVER WITH ALL THE NEW POEMS AND STATES OF THE NATION THAT COME OUT.
LADY RUSSELL QUITE BORES ONE WITH HER NEW PUBLICATIONS.
YOU NEED NOT TELL HER SO, BUT I THOUGHT HER DRESS HIDEOUS THE OTHER NIGHT.
I USED TO THINK SHE HAD SOME TASTE IN DRESS, BUT I WAS ASHAMED OF HER
AT THE CONCERT.  SOMETHING SO FORMAL AND ARRANGE IN HER AIR!
AND SHE SITS SO UPRIGHT!  MY BEST LOVE, OF COURSE."

"AND MINE," ADDED SIR WALTER.  "KINDEST REGARDS.  AND YOU MAY SAY,
THAT I MEAN TO CALL UPON HER SOON.  MAKE A CIVIL MESSAGE;
BUT I SHALL ONLY LEAVE MY CARD.  MORNING VISITS ARE NEVER FAIR
BY WOMEN AT HER TIME OF LIFE, WHO MAKE THEMSELVES UP SO LITTLE.
IF SHE WOULD ONLY WEAR ROUGE SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF BEING SEEN;
BUT LAST TIME I CALLED, I OBSERVED THE BLINDS WERE LET DOWN IMMEDIATELY."

WHILE HER FATHER SPOKE, THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  WHO COULD IT BE?
ANNE, REMEMBERING THE PRECONCERTED VISITS, AT ALL HOURS, OF MR ELLIOT,
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HIM, BUT FOR HIS KNOWN ENGAGEMENT SEVEN MILES OFF.
AFTER THE USUAL PERIOD OF SUSPENSE, THE USUAL SOUNDS OF APPROACH WERE HEARD,
AND "MR AND MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE" WERE USHERED INTO THE ROOM.

SURPRISE WAS THE STRONGEST EMOTION RAISED BY THEIR APPEARANCE;
BUT ANNE WAS REALLY GLAD TO SEE THEM; AND THE OTHERS WERE NOT SO SORRY
BUT THAT THEY COULD PUT ON A DECENT AIR OF WELCOME; AND AS SOON
AS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THESE, THEIR NEAREST RELATIONS, WERE NOT ARRIVED
WITH AN VIEWS OF ACCOMMODATION IN THAT HOUSE, SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH
WERE ABLE TO RISE IN CORDIALITY, AND DO THE HONOURS OF IT VERY WELL.
THEY WERE COME TO BATH FOR A FEW DAYS WITH MRS MUSGROVE, AND WERE
AT THE WHITE HART.  SO MUCH WAS PRETTY SOON UNDERSTOOD;
BUT TILL SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE WALKING MARY INTO
THE OTHER DRAWING-ROOM, AND REGALING THEMSELVES WITH HER ADMIRATION,
ANNE COULD NOT DRAW UPON CHARLES'S BRAIN FOR A REGULAR HISTORY
OF THEIR COMING, OR AN EXPLANATION OF SOME SMILING HINTS
OF PARTICULAR BUSINESS, WHICH HAD BEEN OSTENTATIOUSLY DROPPED BY MARY,
AS WELL AS OF SOME APPARENT CONFUSION AS TO WHOM THEIR PARTY CONSISTED OF.

SHE THEN FOUND THAT IT CONSISTED OF MRS MUSGROVE, HENRIETTA,
AND CAPTAIN HARVILLE, BESIDE THEIR TWO SELVES.  HE GAVE HER A VERY PLAIN,
INTELLIGIBLE ACCOUNT OF THE WHOLE; A NARRATION IN WHICH SHE SAW
A GREAT DEAL OF MOST CHARACTERISTIC PROCEEDING.  THE SCHEME
HAD RECEIVED ITS FIRST IMPULSE BY CAPTAIN HARVILLE'S WANTING TO
COME TO BATH ON BUSINESS.  HE HAD BEGUN TO TALK OF IT A WEEK AGO;
AND BY WAY OF DOING SOMETHING, AS SHOOTING WAS OVER, CHARLES HAD PROPOSED
COMING WITH HIM, AND MRS HARVILLE HAD SEEMED TO LIKE THE IDEA OF IT
VERY MUCH, AS AN ADVANTAGE TO HER HUSBAND; BUT MARY COULD NOT BEAR
TO BE LEFT, AND HAD MADE HERSELF SO UNHAPPY ABOUT IT, THAT FOR A DAY OR TWO
EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE IN SUSPENSE, OR AT AN END.  BUT THEN,
IT HAD BEEN TAKEN UP BY HIS FATHER AND MOTHER.  HIS MOTHER HAD
SOME OLD FRIENDS IN BATH WHOM SHE WANTED TO SEE; IT WAS THOUGHT
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR HENRIETTA TO COME AND BUY WEDDING-CLOTHES
FOR HERSELF AND HER SISTER; AND, IN SHORT, IT ENDED IN BEING
HIS MOTHER'S PARTY, THAT EVERYTHING MIGHT BE COMFORTABLE AND EASY
TO CAPTAIN HARVILLE; AND HE AND MARY WERE INCLUDED IN IT
BY WAY OF GENERAL CONVENIENCE.  THEY HAD ARRIVED LATE THE NIGHT BEFORE.
MRS HARVILLE, HER CHILDREN, AND CAPTAIN BENWICK, REMAINED WITH
MR MUSGROVE AND LOUISA AT UPPERCROSS.

ANNE'S ONLY SURPRISE WAS, THAT AFFAIRS SHOULD BE IN FORWARDNESS ENOUGH
FOR HENRIETTA'S WEDDING-CLOTHES TO BE TALKED OF.  SHE HAD IMAGINED
SUCH DIFFICULTIES OF FORTUNE TO EXIST THERE AS MUST PREVENT
THE MARRIAGE FROM BEING NEAR AT HAND; BUT SHE LEARNED FROM CHARLES THAT,
VERY RECENTLY, (SINCE MARY'S LAST LETTER TO HERSELF), CHARLES HAYTER
HAD BEEN APPLIED TO BY A FRIEND TO HOLD A LIVING FOR A YOUTH
WHO COULD NOT POSSIBLY CLAIM IT UNDER MANY YEARS; AND THAT
ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS PRESENT INCOME, WITH ALMOST A CERTAINTY
OF SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT LONG BEFORE THE TERM IN QUESTION,
THE TWO FAMILIES HAD CONSENTED TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S WISHES,
AND THAT THEIR MARRIAGE WAS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE IN A FEW MONTHS,
QUITE AS SOON AS LOUISA'S.  "AND A VERY GOOD LIVING IT WAS,"
CHARLES ADDED:  "ONLY FIVE-AND-TWENTY MILES FROM UPPERCROSS,
AND IN A VERY FINE COUNTRY:   FINE PART OF DORSETSHIRE.
IN THE CENTRE OF SOME OF THE BEST PRESERVES IN THE KINGDOM,
SURROUNDED BY THREE GREAT PROPRIETORS, EACH MORE CAREFUL AND JEALOUS
THAN THE OTHER; AND TO TWO OF THE THREE AT LEAST, CHARLES HAYTER MIGHT GET
A SPECIAL RECOMMENDATION.  NOT THAT HE WILL VALUE IT AS HE OUGHT,"
HE OBSERVED, "CHARLES IS TOO COOL ABOUT SPORTING. THAT'S THE WORST OF HIM."

"I AM EXTREMELY GLAD, INDEED," CRIED ANNE, "PARTICULARLY GLAD
THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN; AND THAT OF TWO SISTERS, WHO BOTH DESERVE
EQUALLY WELL, AND WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUCH GOOD FRIENDS,
THE PLEASANT PROSPECT OF ONE SHOULD NOT BE DIMMING THOSE OF THE OTHER--
THAT THEY SHOULD BE SO EQUAL IN THEIR PROSPERITY AND COMFORT.
I HOPE YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER ARE QUITE HAPPY WITH REGARD TO BOTH."

"OH! YES.  MY FATHER WOULD BE WELL PLEASED IF THE GENTLEMEN WERE RICHER,
BUT HE HAS NO OTHER FAULT TO FIND.  MONEY, YOU KNOW, COMING DOWN WITH
MONEY--TWO DAUGHTERS AT ONCE--IT CANNOT BE A VERY AGREEABLE OPERATION,
AND IT STREIGHTENS HIM AS TO MANY THINGS.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY
THEY HAVE NOT A RIGHT TO IT.  IT IS VERY FIT THEY SHOULD HAVE
DAUGHTERS' SHARES; AND I AM SURE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY KIND,
LIBERAL FATHER TO ME.  MARY DOES NOT ABOVE HALF LIKE HENRIETTA'S MATCH.
SHE NEVER DID, YOU KNOW.  BUT SHE DOES NOT DO HIM JUSTICE,
NOR THINK ENOUGH ABOUT WINTHROP.  I CANNOT MAKE HER ATTEND TO
THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY.  IT IS A VERY FAIR MATCH, AS TIMES GO;
AND I HAVE LIKED CHARLES HAYTER ALL MY LIFE, AND I SHALL NOT LEAVE OFF NOW."

"SUCH EXCELLENT PARENTS AS MR AND MRS MUSGROVE," EXCLAIMED ANNE,
"SHOULD BE HAPPY IN THEIR CHILDREN'S MARRIAGES.  THEY DO EVERYTHING
TO CONFER HAPPINESS, I AM SURE.  WHAT A BLESSING TO YOUNG PEOPLE
TO BE IN SUCH HANDS!  YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER SEEM SO TOTALLY FREE
FROM ALL THOSE AMBITIOUS FEELINGS WHICH HAVE LED TO SO MUCH MISCONDUCT
AND MISERY, BOTH IN YOUNG AND OLD.  I HOPE YOU THINK LOUISA
PERFECTLY RECOVERED NOW?"

HE ANSWERED RATHER HESITATINGLY, "YES, I BELIEVE I DO; VERY MUCH RECOVERED;
BUT SHE IS ALTERED; THERE IS NO RUNNING OR JUMPING ABOUT, NO LAUGHING
OR DANCING; IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT.  IF ONE HAPPENS ONLY TO SHUT THE DOOR
A LITTLE HARD, SHE STARTS AND WRIGGLES LIKE A YOUNG DAB-CHICK IN THE WATER;
AND BENWICK SITS AT HER ELBOW, READING VERSES, OR WHISPERING TO HER,
ALL DAY LONG."

ANNE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING.  "THAT CANNOT BE MUCH TO YOUR TASTE,
I KNOW," SAID SHE; "BUT I DO BELIEVE HIM TO BE AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN."

"TO BE SURE HE IS.  NOBODY DOUBTS IT; AND I HOPE YOU DO NOT THINK
I AM SO ILLIBERAL AS TO WANT EVERY MAN TO HAVE THE SAME OBJECTS AND
PLEASURES AS MYSELF.  I HAVE A GREAT VALUE FOR BENWICK; AND WHEN ONE CAN
BUT GET HIM TO TALK, HE HAS PLENTY TO SAY.  HIS READING HAS DONE HIM
NO HARM, FOR HE HAS FOUGHT AS WELL AS READ.  HE IS A BRAVE FELLOW.
I GOT MORE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM LAST MONDAY THAN EVER I DID BEFORE.
WE HAD A FAMOUS SET-TO AT RAT-HUNTING ALL THE MORNING IN
MY FATHER'S GREAT BARNS; AND HE PLAYED HIS PART SO WELL
THAT I HAVE LIKED HIM THE BETTER EVER SINCE."

HERE THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF CHARLES'S
FOLLOWING THE OTHERS TO ADMIRE MIRRORS AND CHINA; BUT ANNE HAD
HEARD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT STATE OF UPPERCROSS,
AND REJOICE IN ITS HAPPINESS; AND THOUGH SHE SIGHED AS SHE REJOICED,
HER SIGH HAD NONE OF THE ILL-WILL OF ENVY IN IT.  SHE WOULD CERTAINLY
HAVE RISEN TO THEIR BLESSINGS IF SHE COULD, BUT SHE DID NOT WANT
TO LESSEN THEIRS.

THE VISIT PASSED OFF ALTOGETHER IN HIGH GOOD HUMOUR.  MARY WAS
IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS, ENJOYING THE GAIETY AND THE CHANGE,
AND SO WELL SATISFIED WITH THE JOURNEY IN HER MOTHER-IN-LAW'S CARRIAGE
WITH FOUR HORSES, AND WITH HER OWN COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE OF CAMDEN PLACE,
THAT SHE WAS EXACTLY IN A TEMPER TO ADMIRE EVERYTHING AS SHE OUGHT,
AND ENTER MOST READILY INTO ALL THE SUPERIORITIES OF THE HOUSE,
AS THEY WERE DETAILED TO HER.  SHE HAD NO DEMANDS ON HER FATHER OR SISTER,
AND HER CONSEQUENCE WAS JUST ENOUGH INCREASED BY THEIR HANDSOME
DRAWING-ROOMS.

ELIZABETH WAS, FOR A SHORT TIME, SUFFERING A GOOD DEAL.
SHE FELT THAT MRS MUSGROVE AND ALL HER PARTY OUGHT TO BE ASKED
TO DINE WITH THEM; BUT SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE THE DIFFERENCE OF STYLE,
THE REDUCTION OF SERVANTS, WHICH A DINNER MUST BETRAY, WITNESSED BY THOSE
WHO HAD BEEN ALWAYS SO INFERIOR TO THE ELLIOTS OF KELLYNCH.
IT WAS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN PROPRIETY AND VANITY; BUT VANITY GOT THE BETTER,
AND THEN ELIZABETH WAS HAPPY AGAIN.  THESE WERE HER INTERNAL PERSUASIONS:
"OLD FASHIONED NOTIONS; COUNTRY HOSPITALITY; WE DO NOT PROFESS
TO GIVE DINNERS; FEW PEOPLE IN BATH DO; LADY ALICIA NEVER DOES;
DID NOT EVEN ASK HER OWN SISTER'S FAMILY, THOUGH THEY WERE HERE A MONTH:
AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD BE VERY INCONVENIENT TO MRS MUSGROVE;
PUT HER QUITE OUT OF HER WAY.  I AM SURE SHE WOULD RATHER NOT COME;
SHE CANNOT FEEL EASY WITH US.  I WILL ASK THEM ALL FOR AN EVENING;
THAT WILL BE MUCH BETTER; THAT WILL BE A NOVELTY AND A TREAT.
THEY HAVE NOT SEEN TWO SUCH DRAWING ROOMS BEFORE.  THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED
TO COME TO-MORROW EVENING.  IT SHALL BE A REGULAR PARTY, SMALL,
BUT MOST ELEGANT."  AND THIS SATISFIED ELIZABETH:  AND WHEN THE INVITATION
WAS GIVEN TO THE TWO PRESENT, AND PROMISED FOR THE ABSENT,
MARY WAS AS COMPLETELY SATISFIED.  SHE WAS PARTICULARLY ASKED
TO MEET MR ELLIOT, AND BE INTRODUCED TO LADY DALRYMPLE AND MISS CARTERET,
WHO WERE FORTUNATELY ALREADY ENGAGED TO COME; AND SHE COULD NOT
HAVE RECEIVED A MORE GRATIFYING ATTENTION.  MISS ELLIOT WAS TO HAVE
THE HONOUR OF CALLING ON MRS MUSGROVE IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING;
AND ANNE WALKED OFF WITH CHARLES AND MARY, TO GO AND SEE HER
AND HENRIETTA DIRECTLY.

HER PLAN OF SITTING WITH LADY RUSSELL MUST GIVE WAY FOR THE PRESENT.
THEY ALL THREE CALLED IN RIVERS STREET FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES;
BUT ANNE CONVINCED HERSELF THAT A DAY'S DELAY OF THE INTENDED COMMUNICATION
COULD BE OF NO CONSEQUENCE, AND HASTENED FORWARD TO THE WHITE HART,
TO SEE AGAIN THE FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS OF THE LAST AUTUMN,
WITH AN EAGERNESS OF GOOD-WILL WHICH MANY ASSOCIATIONS CONTRIBUTED TO FORM.

THEY FOUND MRS MUSGROVE AND HER DAUGHTER WITHIN, AND BY THEMSELVES,
AND ANNE HAD THE KINDEST WELCOME FROM EACH.  HENRIETTA WAS EXACTLY
IN THAT STATE OF RECENTLY-IMPROVED VIEWS, OF FRESH-FORMED HAPPINESS,
WHICH MADE HER FULL OF REGARD AND INTEREST FOR EVERYBODY SHE HAD
EVER LIKED BEFORE AT ALL; AND MRS MUSGROVE'S REAL AFFECTION HAD BEEN WON
BY HER USEFULNESS WHEN THEY WERE IN DISTRESS.  IT WAS A HEARTINESS,
AND A WARMTH, AND A SINCERITY WHICH ANNE DELIGHTED IN THE MORE,
FROM THE SAD WANT OF SUCH BLESSINGS AT HOME.  SHE WAS ENTREATED
TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH OF HER TIME AS POSSIBLE, INVITED FOR EVERY DAY
AND ALL DAY LONG, OR RATHER CLAIMED AS PART OF THE FAMILY; AND, IN RETURN,
SHE NATURALLY FELL INTO ALL HER WONTED WAYS OF ATTENTION AND ASSISTANCE,
AND ON CHARLES'S LEAVING THEM TOGETHER, WAS LISTENING TO MRS MUSGROVE'S
HISTORY OF LOUISA, AND TO HENRIETTA'S OF HERSELF, GIVING OPINIONS
ON BUSINESS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO SHOPS; WITH INTERVALS OF EVERY HELP
WHICH MARY REQUIRED, FROM ALTERING HER RIBBON TO SETTLING HER ACCOUNTS;
FROM FINDING HER KEYS, AND ASSORTING HER TRINKETS, TO TRYING
TO CONVINCE HER THAT SHE WAS NOT ILL-USED BY ANYBODY; WHICH MARY,
WELL AMUSED AS SHE GENERALLY WAS, IN HER STATION AT A WINDOW
OVERLOOKING THE ENTRANCE TO THE PUMP ROOM, COULD NOT BUT HAVE
HER MOMENTS OF IMAGINING.

A MORNING OF THOROUGH CONFUSION WAS TO BE EXPECTED.  A LARGE PARTY
IN AN HOTEL ENSURED A QUICK-CHANGING, UNSETTLED SCENE.  ONE FIVE MINUTES
BROUGHT A NOTE, THE NEXT A PARCEL; AND ANNE HAD NOT BEEN THERE
HALF AN HOUR, WHEN THEIR DINING-ROOM, SPACIOUS AS IT WAS,
SEEMED MORE THAN HALF FILLED:  A PARTY OF STEADY OLD FRIENDS
WERE SEATED AROUND MRS MUSGROVE, AND CHARLES CAME BACK WITH
CAPTAINS HARVILLE AND WENTWORTH.  THE APPEARANCE OF THE LATTER
COULD NOT BE MORE THAN THE SURPRISE OF THE MOMENT.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HER TO HAVE FORGOTTEN TO FEEL THAT THIS ARRIVAL OF THEIR
COMMON FRIENDS MUST BE SOON BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AGAIN.
THEIR LAST MEETING HAD BEEN MOST IMPORTANT IN OPENING HIS FEELINGS;
SHE HAD DERIVED FROM IT A DELIGHTFUL CONVICTION; BUT SHE FEARED
FROM HIS LOOKS, THAT THE SAME UNFORTUNATE PERSUASION, WHICH HAD
HASTENED HIM AWAY FROM THE CONCERT ROOM, STILL GOVERNED.
HE DID NOT SEEM TO WANT TO BE NEAR ENOUGH FOR CONVERSATION.

SHE TRIED TO BE CALM, AND LEAVE THINGS TO TAKE THEIR COURSE,
AND TRIED TO DWELL MUCH ON THIS ARGUMENT OF RATIONAL DEPENDENCE:--
"SURELY, IF THERE BE CONSTANT ATTACHMENT ON EACH SIDE, OUR HEARTS
MUST UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER ERE LONG.  WE ARE NOT BOY AND GIRL,
TO BE CAPTIOUSLY IRRITABLE, MISLED BY EVERY MOMENT'S INADVERTENCE,
AND WANTONLY PLAYING WITH OUR OWN HAPPINESS."  AND YET,
A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS, SHE FELT AS IF THEIR BEING IN COMPANY
WITH EACH OTHER, UNDER THEIR PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, COULD ONLY BE
EXPOSING THEM TO INADVERTENCIES AND MISCONSTRUCTIONS OF THE MOST
MISCHIEVOUS KIND.

"ANNE," CRIED MARY, STILL AT HER WINDOW, "THERE IS MRS CLAY,
I AM SURE, STANDING UNDER THE COLONNADE, AND A GENTLEMAN WITH HER.
I SAW THEM TURN THE CORNER FROM BATH STREET JUST NOW.  THEY SEEMED
DEEP IN TALK.  WHO IS IT?  COME, AND TELL ME.  GOOD HEAVENS! I RECOLLECT.
IT IS MR ELLIOT HIMSELF."

"NO," CRIED ANNE, QUICKLY, "IT CANNOT BE MR ELLIOT, I ASSURE YOU.
HE WAS TO LEAVE BATH AT NINE THIS MORNING, AND DOES NOT COME BACK
TILL TO-MORROW."

AS SHE SPOKE, SHE FELT THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS LOOKING AT HER,
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHICH VEXED AND EMBARRASSED HER, AND MADE HER REGRET
THAT SHE HAD SAID SO MUCH, SIMPLE AS IT WAS.

MARY, RESENTING THAT SHE SHOULD BE SUPPOSED NOT TO KNOW HER OWN COUSIN,
BEGAN TALKING VERY WARMLY ABOUT THE FAMILY FEATURES, AND PROTESTING
STILL MORE POSITIVELY THAT IT WAS MR ELLIOT, CALLING AGAIN UPON ANNE
TO COME AND LOOK FOR HERSELF, BUT ANNE DID NOT MEAN TO STIR,
AND TRIED TO BE COOL AND UNCONCERNED.  HER DISTRESS RETURNED,
HOWEVER, ON PERCEIVING SMILES AND INTELLIGENT GLANCES PASS BETWEEN
TWO OR THREE OF THE LADY VISITORS, AS IF THEY BELIEVED THEMSELVES
QUITE IN THE SECRET.  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE REPORT CONCERNING HER
HAD SPREAD, AND A SHORT PAUSE SUCCEEDED, WHICH SEEMED TO ENSURE
THAT IT WOULD NOW SPREAD FARTHER.

"DO COME, ANNE" CRIED MARY, "COME AND LOOK YOURSELF.  YOU WILL BE TOO LATE
IF YOU DO NOT MAKE HASTE.  THEY ARE PARTING; THEY ARE SHAKING HANDS.
HE IS TURNING AWAY.  NOT KNOW MR ELLIOT, INDEED!  YOU SEEM TO HAVE
FORGOT ALL ABOUT LYME."

TO PACIFY MARY, AND PERHAPS SCREEN HER OWN EMBARRASSMENT,
ANNE DID MOVE QUIETLY TO THE WINDOW.  SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO ASCERTAIN
THAT IT REALLY WAS MR ELLIOT, WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BELIEVED,
BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED ON ONE SIDE, AS MRS CLAY WALKED QUICKLY OFF
ON THE OTHER; AND CHECKING THE SURPRISE WHICH SHE COULD NOT BUT FEEL
AT SUCH AN APPEARANCE OF FRIENDLY CONFERENCE BETWEEN TWO PERSONS
OF TOTALLY OPPOSITE INTEREST, SHE CALMLY SAID, "YES, IT IS MR ELLIOT,
CERTAINLY.  HE HAS CHANGED HIS HOUR OF GOING, I SUPPOSE, THAT IS ALL,
OR I MAY BE MISTAKEN, I MIGHT NOT ATTEND;" AND WALKED BACK TO HER CHAIR,
RECOMPOSED, AND WITH THE COMFORTABLE HOPE OF HAVING ACQUITTED HERSELF WELL.

THE VISITORS TOOK THEIR LEAVE; AND CHARLES, HAVING CIVILLY SEEN THEM OFF,
AND THEN MADE A FACE AT THEM, AND ABUSED THEM FOR COMING, BEGAN WITH--

"WELL, MOTHER, I HAVE DONE SOMETHING FOR YOU THAT YOU WILL LIKE.
I HAVE BEEN TO THE THEATRE, AND SECURED A BOX FOR TO-MORROW NIGHT.
A'N'T I A GOOD BOY?  I KNOW YOU LOVE A PLAY; AND THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL.
IT HOLDS NINE.  I HAVE ENGAGED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  ANNE WILL
NOT BE SORRY TO JOIN US, I AM SURE.  WE ALL LIKE A PLAY.
HAVE NOT I DONE WELL, MOTHER?"

MRS MUSGROVE WAS GOOD HUMOUREDLY BEGINNING TO EXPRESS HER PERFECT READINESS
FOR THE PLAY, IF HENRIETTA AND ALL THE OTHERS LIKED IT, WHEN MARY
EAGERLY INTERRUPTED HER BY EXCLAIMING--

"GOOD HEAVENS, CHARLES! HOW CAN YOU THINK OF SUCH A THING?
TAKE A BOX FOR TO-MORROW NIGHT!  HAVE YOU FORGOT THAT WE ARE ENGAGED
TO CAMDEN PLACE TO-MORROW NIGHT? AND THAT WE WERE MOST PARTICULARLY ASKED
TO MEET LADY DALRYMPLE AND HER DAUGHTER, AND MR ELLIOT, AND ALL
THE PRINCIPAL FAMILY CONNEXIONS, ON PURPOSE TO BE INTRODUCED TO THEM?
HOW CAN YOU BE SO FORGETFUL?"

"PHOO! PHOO!" REPLIED CHARLES, "WHAT'S AN EVENING PARTY?
NEVER WORTH REMEMBERING.  YOUR FATHER MIGHT HAVE ASKED US TO DINNER,
I THINK, IF HE HAD WANTED TO SEE US.  YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE,
BUT I SHALL GO TO THE PLAY."

"OH! CHARLES, I DECLARE IT WILL BE TOO ABOMINABLE IF YOU DO,
WHEN YOU PROMISED TO GO."

"NO, I DID NOT PROMISE.  I ONLY SMIRKED AND BOWED, AND SAID THE WORD
`HAPPY.'  THERE WAS NO PROMISE."

"BUT YOU MUST GO, CHARLES.  IT WOULD BE UNPARDONABLE TO FAIL.
WE WERE ASKED ON PURPOSE TO BE INTRODUCED.  THERE WAS ALWAYS
SUCH A GREAT CONNEXION BETWEEN THE DALRYMPLES AND OURSELVES.
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ON EITHER SIDE THAT WAS NOT ANNOUNCED IMMEDIATELY.
WE ARE QUITE NEAR RELATIONS, YOU KNOW; AND MR ELLIOT TOO,
WHOM YOU OUGHT SO PARTICULARLY TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH!  EVERY ATTENTION
IS DUE TO MR ELLIOT.  CONSIDER, MY FATHER'S HEIR:  THE FUTURE
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FAMILY."

"DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT HEIRS AND REPRESENTATIVES," CRIED CHARLES.
"I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO NEGLECT THE REIGNING POWER TO BOW
TO THE RISING SUN.  IF I WOULD NOT GO FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FATHER,
I SHOULD THINK IT SCANDALOUS TO GO FOR THE SAKE OF HIS HEIR.
WHAT IS MR ELLIOT TO ME?"  THE CARELESS EXPRESSION WAS LIFE TO ANNE,
WHO SAW THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS ALL ATTENTION, LOOKING AND
LISTENING WITH HIS WHOLE SOUL; AND THAT THE LAST WORDS BROUGHT
HIS ENQUIRING EYES FROM CHARLES TO HERSELF.

CHARLES AND MARY STILL TALKED ON IN THE SAME STYLE; HE, HALF SERIOUS
AND HALF JESTING, MAINTAINING THE SCHEME FOR THE PLAY, AND SHE,
INVARIABLY SERIOUS, MOST WARMLY OPPOSING IT, AND NOT OMITTING
TO MAKE IT KNOWN THAT, HOWEVER DETERMINED TO GO TO CAMDEN PLACE HERSELF,
SHE SHOULD NOT THINK HERSELF VERY WELL USED, IF THEY WENT TO THE PLAY
WITHOUT HER.  MRS MUSGROVE INTERPOSED.

"WE HAD BETTER PUT IT OFF.  CHARLES, YOU HAD MUCH BETTER GO BACK
AND CHANGE THE BOX FOR TUESDAY.  IT WOULD BE A PITY TO BE DIVIDED,
AND WE SHOULD BE LOSING MISS ANNE, TOO, IF THERE IS A PARTY AT HER FATHER'S;
AND I AM SURE NEITHER HENRIETTA NOR I SHOULD CARE AT ALL FOR THE PLAY,
IF MISS ANNE COULD NOT BE WITH US."

ANNE FELT TRULY OBLIGED TO HER FOR SUCH KINDNESS; AND QUITE AS MUCH
SO FOR THE OPPORTUNITY IT GAVE HER OF DECIDEDLY SAYING--

"IF IT DEPENDED ONLY ON MY INCLINATION, MA'AM, THE PARTY AT HOME
(EXCEPTING ON MARY'S ACCOUNT) WOULD NOT BE THE SMALLEST IMPEDIMENT.
I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN THE SORT OF MEETING, AND SHOULD BE TOO HAPPY
TO CHANGE IT FOR A PLAY, AND WITH YOU.  BUT, IT HAD BETTER
NOT BE ATTEMPTED, PERHAPS."  SHE HAD SPOKEN IT; BUT SHE TREMBLED
WHEN IT WAS DONE, CONSCIOUS THAT HER WORDS WERE LISTENED TO,
AND DARING NOT EVEN TO TRY TO OBSERVE THEIR EFFECT.

IT WAS SOON GENERALLY AGREED THAT TUESDAY SHOULD BE THE DAY;
CHARLES ONLY RESERVING THE ADVANTAGE OF STILL TEASING HIS WIFE,
BY PERSISTING THAT HE WOULD GO TO THE PLAY TO-MORROW IF NOBODY ELSE WOULD.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH LEFT HIS SEAT, AND WALKED TO THE FIRE-PLACE;
PROBABLY FOR THE SAKE OF WALKING AWAY FROM IT SOON AFTERWARDS,
AND TAKING A STATION, WITH LESS BARE-FACED DESIGN, BY ANNE.

"YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN BATH," SAID HE, "TO ENJOY
THE EVENING PARTIES OF THE PLACE."

"OH! NO.  THE USUAL CHARACTER OF THEM HAS NOTHING FOR ME.
I AM NO CARD-PLAYER."

"YOU WERE NOT FORMERLY, I KNOW.  YOU DID NOT USE TO LIKE CARDS;
BUT TIME MAKES MANY CHANGES."

"I AM NOT YET SO MUCH CHANGED," CRIED ANNE, AND STOPPED, FEARING SHE
HARDLY KNEW WHAT MISCONSTRUCTION.  AFTER WAITING A FEW MOMENTS
HE SAID, AND AS IF IT WERE THE RESULT OF IMMEDIATE FEELING,
"IT IS A PERIOD, INDEED!  EIGHT YEARS AND A HALF IS A PERIOD."

WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED FARTHER WAS LEFT TO ANNE'S IMAGINATION
TO PONDER OVER IN A CALMER HOUR; FOR WHILE STILL HEARING THE SOUNDS
HE HAD UTTERED, SHE WAS STARTLED TO OTHER SUBJECTS BY HENRIETTA,
EAGER TO MAKE USE OF THE PRESENT LEISURE FOR GETTING OUT,
AND CALLING ON HER COMPANIONS TO LOSE NO TIME, LEST SOMEBODY ELSE
SHOULD COME IN.

THEY WERE OBLIGED TO MOVE.  ANNE TALKED OF BEING PERFECTLY READY,
AND TRIED TO LOOK IT; BUT SHE FELT THAT COULD HENRIETTA HAVE KNOWN
THE REGRET AND RELUCTANCE OF HER HEART IN QUITTING THAT CHAIR,
IN PREPARING TO QUIT THE ROOM, SHE WOULD HAVE FOUND, IN ALL HER OWN
SENSATIONS FOR HER COUSIN, IN THE VERY SECURITY OF HIS AFFECTION,
WHEREWITH TO PITY HER.

THEIR PREPARATIONS, HOWEVER, WERE STOPPED SHORT.  ALARMING SOUNDS
WERE HEARD; OTHER VISITORS APPROACHED, AND THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN
FOR SIR WALTER AND MISS ELLIOT, WHOSE ENTRANCE SEEMED TO GIVE
A GENERAL CHILL.  ANNE FELT AN INSTANT OPPRESSION, AND WHEREVER SHE LOOKED
SAW SYMPTOMS OF THE SAME.  THE COMFORT, THE FREEDOM, THE GAIETY
OF THE ROOM WAS OVER, HUSHED INTO COLD COMPOSURE, DETERMINED SILENCE,
OR INSIPID TALK, TO MEET THE HEARTLESS ELEGANCE OF HER FATHER AND SISTER.
HOW MORTIFYING TO FEEL THAT IT WAS SO!

HER JEALOUS EYE WAS SATISFIED IN ONE PARTICULAR.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AGAIN BY EACH, BY ELIZABETH MORE GRACIOUSLY THAN BEFORE.
SHE EVEN ADDRESSED HIM ONCE, AND LOOKED AT HIM MORE THAN ONCE.
ELIZABETH WAS, IN FACT, REVOLVING A GREAT MEASURE.  THE SEQUEL
EXPLAINED IT.  AFTER THE WASTE OF A FEW MINUTES IN SAYING
THE PROPER NOTHINGS, SHE BEGAN TO GIVE THE INVITATION WHICH
WAS TO COMPRISE ALL THE REMAINING DUES OF THE MUSGROVES.
"TO-MORROW EVENING, TO MEET A FEW FRIENDS:  NO FORMAL PARTY."
IT WAS ALL SAID VERY GRACEFULLY, AND THE CARDS WITH WHICH SHE HAD
PROVIDED HERSELF, THE "MISS ELLIOT AT HOME," WERE LAID ON THE TABLE,
WITH A COURTEOUS, COMPREHENSIVE SMILE TO ALL, AND ONE SMILE AND
ONE CARD MORE DECIDEDLY FOR CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  THE TRUTH WAS,
THAT ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN BATH TO UNDERSTAND
THE IMPORTANCE OF A MAN OF SUCH AN AIR AND APPEARANCE AS HIS.
THE PAST WAS NOTHING.  THE PRESENT WAS THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
WOULD MOVE ABOUT WELL IN HER DRAWING-ROOM.  THE CARD WAS POINTEDLY GIVEN,
AND SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH AROSE AND DISAPPEARED.

THE INTERRUPTION HAD BEEN SHORT, THOUGH SEVERE, AND EASE AND ANIMATION
RETURNED TO MOST OF THOSE THEY LEFT AS THE DOOR SHUT THEM OUT,
BUT NOT TO ANNE.  SHE COULD THINK ONLY OF THE INVITATION SHE HAD
WITH SUCH ASTONISHMENT WITNESSED, AND OF THE MANNER IN WHICH
IT HAD BEEN RECEIVED; A MANNER OF DOUBTFUL MEANING, OF SURPRISE RATHER
THAN GRATIFICATION, OF POLITE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT RATHER THAN ACCEPTANCE.
SHE KNEW HIM; SHE SAW DISDAIN IN HIS EYE, AND COULD NOT VENTURE TO BELIEVE
THAT HE HAD DETERMINED TO ACCEPT SUCH AN OFFERING, AS AN ATONEMENT
FOR ALL THE INSOLENCE OF THE PAST.  HER SPIRITS SANK.  HE HELD THE CARD
IN HIS HAND AFTER THEY WERE GONE, AS IF DEEPLY CONSIDERING IT.

"ONLY THINK OF ELIZABETH'S INCLUDING EVERYBODY!" WHISPERED MARY
VERY AUDIBLY.  "I DO NOT WONDER CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IS DELIGHTED!
YOU SEE HE CANNOT PUT THE CARD OUT OF HIS HAND."

ANNE CAUGHT HIS EYE, SAW HIS CHEEKS GLOW, AND HIS MOUTH FORM ITSELF
INTO A MOMENTARY EXPRESSION OF CONTEMPT, AND TURNED AWAY,
THAT SHE MIGHT NEITHER SEE NOR HEAR MORE TO VEX HER.

THE PARTY SEPARATED.  THE GENTLEMEN HAD THEIR OWN PURSUITS,
THE LADIES PROCEEDED ON THEIR OWN BUSINESS, AND THEY MET NO MORE WHILE
ANNE BELONGED TO THEM.  SHE WAS EARNESTLY BEGGED TO RETURN AND DINE,
AND GIVE THEM ALL THE REST OF THE DAY, BUT HER SPIRITS HAD BEEN
SO LONG EXERTED THAT AT PRESENT SHE FELT UNEQUAL TO MORE,
AND FIT ONLY FOR HOME, WHERE SHE MIGHT BE SURE OF BEING AS SILENT
AS SHE CHOSE.

PROMISING TO BE WITH THEM THE WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING MORNING, THEREFORE,
SHE CLOSED THE FATIGUES OF THE PRESENT BY A TOILSOME WALK TO CAMDEN PLACE,
THERE TO SPEND THE EVENING CHIEFLY IN LISTENING TO THE BUSY ARRANGEMENTS
OF ELIZABETH AND MRS CLAY FOR THE MORROW'S PARTY, THE FREQUENT ENUMERATION
OF THE PERSONS INVITED, AND THE CONTINUALLY IMPROVING DETAIL OF ALL
THE EMBELLISHMENTS WHICH WERE TO MAKE IT THE MOST COMPLETELY ELEGANT
OF ITS KIND IN BATH, WHILE HARASSING HERSELF WITH THE NEVER-ENDING
QUESTION, OF WHETHER CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WOULD COME OR NOT?  THEY WERE
RECKONING HIM AS CERTAIN, BUT WITH HER IT WAS A GNAWING SOLICITUDE
NEVER APPEASED FOR FIVE MINUTES TOGETHER.  SHE GENERALLY THOUGHT
HE WOULD COME, BECAUSE SHE GENERALLY THOUGHT HE OUGHT; BUT IT WAS A CASE
WHICH SHE COULD NOT SO SHAPE INTO ANY POSITIVE ACT OF DUTY OR DISCRETION,
AS INEVITABLY TO DEFY THE SUGGESTIONS OF VERY OPPOSITE FEELINGS.

SHE ONLY ROUSED HERSELF FROM THE BROODINGS OF THIS RESTLESS AGITATION,
TO LET MRS CLAY KNOW THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEEN WITH MR ELLIOT
THREE HOURS AFTER HIS BEING SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OF BATH,
FOR HAVING WATCHED IN VAIN FOR SOME INTIMATION OF THE INTERVIEW
FROM THE LADY HERSELF, SHE DETERMINED TO MENTION IT, AND IT SEEMED TO HER
THERE WAS GUILT IN MRS CLAY'S FACE AS SHE LISTENED.  IT WAS TRANSIENT:
CLEARED AWAY IN AN INSTANT; BUT ANNE COULD IMAGINE SHE READ THERE
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING, BY SOME COMPLICATION OF MUTUAL TRICK,
OR SOME OVERBEARING AUTHORITY OF HIS, BEEN OBLIGED TO ATTEND
(PERHAPS FOR HALF AN HOUR) TO HIS LECTURES AND RESTRICTIONS ON HER DESIGNS
ON SIR WALTER.  SHE EXCLAIMED, HOWEVER, WITH A VERY TOLERABLE
IMITATION OF NATURE: --

"OH! DEAR! VERY TRUE.  ONLY THINK, MISS ELLIOT, TO MY GREAT SURPRISE
I MET WITH MR ELLIOT IN BATH STREET.  I WAS NEVER MORE ASTONISHED.
HE TURNED BACK AND WALKED WITH ME TO THE PUMP YARD.  HE HAD BEEN PREVENTED
SETTING OFF FOR THORNBERRY, BUT I REALLY FORGET BY WHAT;
FOR I WAS IN A HURRY, AND COULD NOT MUCH ATTEND, AND I CAN ONLY ANSWER
FOR HIS BEING DETERMINED NOT TO BE DELAYED IN HIS RETURN.
HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW EARLY HE MIGHT BE ADMITTED TO-MORROW.
HE WAS FULL OF `TO-MORROW,' AND IT IS VERY EVIDENT THAT I HAVE BEEN
FULL OF IT TOO, EVER SINCE I ENTERED THE HOUSE, AND LEARNT THE EXTENSION
OF YOUR PLAN AND ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED, OR MY SEEING HIM COULD NEVER HAVE
GONE SO ENTIRELY OUT OF MY HEAD."



CHAPTER 23


ONE DAY ONLY HAD PASSED SINCE ANNE'S CONVERSATION WITH MRS SMITH;
BUT A KEENER INTEREST HAD SUCCEEDED, AND SHE WAS NOW SO LITTLE TOUCHED
BY MR ELLIOT'S CONDUCT, EXCEPT BY ITS EFFECTS IN ONE QUARTER,
THAT IT BECAME A MATTER OF COURSE THE NEXT MORNING, STILL TO DEFER
HER EXPLANATORY VISIT IN RIVERS STREET.  SHE HAD PROMISED TO BE
WITH THE MUSGROVES FROM BREAKFAST TO DINNER.  HER FAITH WAS PLIGHTED,
AND MR ELLIOT'S CHARACTER, LIKE THE SULTANESS SCHEHERAZADE'S HEAD,
MUST LIVE ANOTHER DAY.

SHE COULD NOT KEEP HER APPOINTMENT PUNCTUALLY, HOWEVER;
THE WEATHER WAS UNFAVOURABLE, AND SHE HAD GRIEVED OVER THE RAIN
ON HER FRIENDS' ACCOUNT, AND FELT IT VERY MUCH ON HER OWN,
BEFORE SHE WAS ABLE TO ATTEMPT THE WALK.  WHEN SHE REACHED THE WHITE HART,
AND MADE HER WAY TO THE PROPER APARTMENT, SHE FOUND HERSELF
NEITHER ARRIVING QUITE IN TIME, NOR THE FIRST TO ARRIVE.
THE PARTY BEFORE HER WERE, MRS MUSGROVE, TALKING TO MRS CROFT,
AND CAPTAIN HARVILLE TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH; AND SHE IMMEDIATELY HEARD
THAT MARY AND HENRIETTA, TOO IMPATIENT TO WAIT, HAD GONE OUT THE MOMENT
IT HAD CLEARED, BUT WOULD BE BACK AGAIN SOON, AND THAT THE STRICTEST
INJUNCTIONS HAD BEEN LEFT WITH MRS MUSGROVE TO KEEP HER THERE
TILL THEY RETURNED.  SHE HAD ONLY TO SUBMIT, SIT DOWN,
BE OUTWARDLY COMPOSED, AND FEEL HERSELF PLUNGED AT ONCE
IN ALL THE AGITATIONS WHICH SHE HAD MERELY LAID HER ACCOUNT OF
TASTING A LITTLE BEFORE THE MORNING CLOSED.  THERE WAS NO DELAY,
NO WASTE OF TIME.  SHE WAS DEEP IN THE HAPPINESS OF SUCH MISERY,
OR THE MISERY OF SUCH HAPPINESS, INSTANTLY.  TWO MINUTES AFTER
HER ENTERING THE ROOM, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SAID--

"WE WILL WRITE THE LETTER WE WERE TALKING OF, HARVILLE, NOW,
IF YOU WILL GIVE ME MATERIALS."

MATERIALS WERE AT HAND, ON A SEPARATE TABLE; HE WENT TO IT,
AND NEARLY TURNING HIS BACK TO THEM ALL, WAS ENGROSSED BY WRITING.

MRS MUSGROVE WAS GIVING MRS CROFT THE HISTORY OF HER ELDEST
DAUGHTER'S ENGAGEMENT, AND JUST IN THAT INCONVENIENT TONE OF VOICE
WHICH WAS PERFECTLY AUDIBLE WHILE IT PRETENDED TO BE A WHISPER.
ANNE FELT THAT SHE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CONVERSATION, AND YET,
AS CAPTAIN HARVILLE SEEMED THOUGHTFUL AND NOT DISPOSED TO TALK,
SHE COULD NOT AVOID HEARING MANY UNDESIRABLE PARTICULARS; SUCH AS,
"HOW MR MUSGROVE AND MY BROTHER HAYTER HAD MET AGAIN AND AGAIN
TO TALK IT OVER; WHAT MY BROTHER HAYTER HAD SAID ONE DAY,
AND WHAT MR MUSGROVE HAD PROPOSED THE NEXT, AND WHAT HAD OCCURRED
TO MY SISTER HAYTER, AND WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD WISHED, AND WHAT
I SAID AT FIRST I NEVER COULD CONSENT TO, BUT WAS AFTERWARDS PERSUADED
TO THINK MIGHT DO VERY WELL," AND A GREAT DEAL IN THE SAME STYLE
OF OPEN-HEARTED COMMUNICATION:  MINUTIAE WHICH, EVEN WITH EVERY ADVANTAGE
OF TASTE AND DELICACY, WHICH GOOD MRS MUSGROVE COULD NOT GIVE,
COULD BE PROPERLY INTERESTING ONLY TO THE PRINCIPALS.  MRS CROFT
WAS ATTENDING WITH GREAT GOOD-HUMOUR, AND WHENEVER SHE SPOKE AT ALL,
IT WAS VERY SENSIBLY.  ANNE HOPED THE GENTLEMEN MIGHT EACH BE
TOO MUCH SELF-OCCUPIED TO HEAR.

"AND SO, MA'AM, ALL THESE THING CONSIDERED," SAID MRS MUSGROVE,
IN HER POWERFUL WHISPER, "THOUGH WE COULD HAVE WISHED IT DIFFERENT,
YET, ALTOGETHER, WE DID NOT THINK IT FAIR TO STAND OUT ANY LONGER,
FOR CHARLES HAYTER WAS QUITE WILD ABOUT IT, AND HENRIETTA WAS
PRETTY NEAR AS BAD; AND SO WE THOUGHT THEY HAD BETTER MARRY AT ONCE,
AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT, AS MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE BEFORE THEM.
AT ANY RATE, SAID I, IT WILL BE BETTER THAN A LONG ENGAGEMENT."

"THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I WAS GOING TO OBSERVE," CRIED MRS CROFT.
"I WOULD RATHER HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE SETTLE ON A SMALL INCOME AT ONCE,
AND HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH A FEW DIFFICULTIES TOGETHER, THAN BE
INVOLVED IN A LONG ENGAGEMENT.  I ALWAYS THINK THAT NO MUTUAL--"

"OH! DEAR MRS CROFT," CRIED MRS MUSGROVE, UNABLE TO LET HER
FINISH HER SPEECH, "THERE IS NOTHING I SO ABOMINATE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
AS A LONG ENGAGEMENT.  IT IS WHAT I ALWAYS PROTESTED AGAINST
FOR MY CHILDREN.  IT IS ALL VERY WELL, I USED TO SAY, FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
TO BE ENGAGED, IF THERE IS A CERTAINTY OF THEIR BEING ABLE TO MARRY
IN SIX MONTHS, OR EVEN IN TWELVE; BUT A LONG ENGAGEMENT--"

"YES, DEAR MA'AM," SAID MRS CROFT, "OR AN UNCERTAIN ENGAGEMENT,
AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH MAY BE LONG.  TO BEGIN WITHOUT KNOWING
THAT AT SUCH A TIME THERE WILL BE THE MEANS OF MARRYING,
I HOLD TO BE VERY UNSAFE AND UNWISE, AND WHAT I THINK ALL PARENTS
SHOULD PREVENT AS FAR AS THEY CAN."

ANNE FOUND AN UNEXPECTED INTEREST HERE.  SHE FELT ITS APPLICATION
TO HERSELF, FELT IT IN A NERVOUS THRILL ALL OVER HER; AND AT THE SAME
MOMENT THAT HER EYES INSTINCTIVELY GLANCED TOWARDS THE DISTANT TABLE,
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S PEN CEASED TO MOVE, HIS HEAD WAS RAISED, PAUSING,
LISTENING, AND HE TURNED ROUND THE NEXT INSTANT TO GIVE A LOOK,
ONE QUICK, CONSCIOUS LOOK AT HER.

THE TWO LADIES CONTINUED TO TALK, TO RE-URGE THE SAME ADMITTED TRUTHS,
AND ENFORCE THEM WITH SUCH EXAMPLES OF THE ILL EFFECT OF
A CONTRARY PRACTICE AS HAD FALLEN WITHIN THEIR OBSERVATION,
BUT ANNE HEARD NOTHING DISTINCTLY; IT WAS ONLY A BUZZ OF WORDS IN HER EAR,
HER MIND WAS IN CONFUSION.

CAPTAIN HARVILLE, WHO HAD IN TRUTH BEEN HEARING NONE OF IT,
NOW LEFT HIS SEAT, AND MOVED TO A WINDOW, AND ANNE SEEMING TO WATCH HIM,
THOUGH IT WAS FROM THOROUGH ABSENCE OF MIND, BECAME GRADUALLY SENSIBLE
THAT HE WAS INVITING HER TO JOIN HIM WHERE HE STOOD.  HE LOOKED AT HER
WITH A SMILE, AND A LITTLE MOTION OF THE HEAD, WHICH EXPRESSED,
"COME TO ME, I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY;" AND THE UNAFFECTED,
EASY KINDNESS OF MANNER WHICH DENOTED THE FEELINGS OF AN OLDER ACQUAINTANCE
THAN HE REALLY WAS, STRONGLY ENFORCED THE INVITATION.  SHE ROUSED HERSELF
AND WENT TO HIM.  THE WINDOW AT WHICH HE STOOD WAS AT THE OTHER END
OF THE ROOM FROM WHERE THE TWO LADIES WERE SITTING, AND THOUGH NEARER
TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S TABLE, NOT VERY NEAR.  AS SHE JOINED HIM,
CAPTAIN HARVILLE'S COUNTENANCE RE-ASSUMED THE SERIOUS, THOUGHTFUL
EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED ITS NATURAL CHARACTER.

"LOOK HERE," SAID HE, UNFOLDING A PARCEL IN HIS HAND, AND DISPLAYING
A SMALL MINIATURE PAINTING, "DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?"

"CERTAINLY:  CAPTAIN BENWICK."

"YES, AND YOU MAY GUESS WHO IT IS FOR.  BUT," (IN A DEEP TONE,)
"IT WAS NOT DONE FOR HER.  MISS ELLIOT, DO YOU REMEMBER OUR
WALKING TOGETHER AT LYME, AND GRIEVING FOR HIM?  I LITTLE THOUGHT THEN--
BUT NO MATTER.  THIS WAS DRAWN AT THE CAPE.  HE MET WITH
A CLEVER YOUNG GERMAN ARTIST AT THE CAPE, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH A PROMISE
TO MY POOR SISTER, SAT TO HIM, AND WAS BRINGING IT HOME FOR HER;
AND I HAVE NOW THE CHARGE OF GETTING IT PROPERLY SET FOR ANOTHER!
IT WAS A COMMISSION TO ME!  BUT WHO ELSE WAS THERE TO EMPLOY?
I HOPE I CAN ALLOW FOR HIM.  I AM NOT SORRY, INDEED, TO MAKE IT
OVER TO ANOTHER.  HE UNDERTAKES IT;" (LOOKING TOWARDS CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,)
"HE IS WRITING ABOUT IT NOW."  AND WITH A QUIVERING LIP HE WOUND UP
THE WHOLE BY ADDING, "POOR FANNY! SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM SO SOON!"

"NO," REPLIED ANNE, IN A LOW, FEELING VOICE. "THAT I CAN EASILY BELIEVE."

"IT WAS NOT IN HER NATURE.  SHE DOTED ON HIM."

"IT WOULD NOT BE THE NATURE OF ANY WOMAN WHO TRULY LOVED."

CAPTAIN HARVILLE SMILED, AS MUCH AS TO SAY, "DO YOU CLAIM THAT
FOR YOUR SEX?" AND SHE ANSWERED THE QUESTION, SMILING ALSO,
"YES.  WE CERTAINLY DO NOT FORGET YOU AS SOON AS YOU FORGET US.
IT IS, PERHAPS, OUR FATE RATHER THAN OUR MERIT.  WE CANNOT HELP OURSELVES.
WE LIVE AT HOME, QUIET, CONFINED, AND OUR FEELINGS PREY UPON US.
YOU ARE FORCED ON EXERTION.  YOU HAVE ALWAYS A PROFESSION, PURSUITS,
BUSINESS OF SOME SORT OR OTHER, TO TAKE YOU BACK INTO THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY,
AND CONTINUAL OCCUPATION AND CHANGE SOON WEAKEN IMPRESSIONS."

"GRANTING YOUR ASSERTION THAT THE WORLD DOES ALL THIS SO SOON FOR MEN
(WHICH, HOWEVER, I DO NOT THINK I SHALL GRANT), IT DOES NOT APPLY
TO BENWICK.  HE HAS NOT BEEN FORCED UPON ANY EXERTION.  THE PEACE
TURNED HIM ON SHORE AT THE VERY MOMENT, AND HE HAS BEEN LIVING WITH US,
IN OUR LITTLE FAMILY CIRCLE, EVER SINCE."

"TRUE," SAID ANNE, "VERY TRUE; I DID NOT RECOLLECT; BUT WHAT SHALL
WE SAY NOW, CAPTAIN HARVILLE?  IF THE CHANGE BE NOT FROM
OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MUST BE FROM WITHIN; IT MUST BE NATURE,
MAN'S NATURE, WHICH HAS DONE THE BUSINESS FOR CAPTAIN BENWICK."

"NO, NO, IT IS NOT MAN'S NATURE.  I WILL NOT ALLOW IT TO BE MORE
MAN'S NATURE THAN WOMAN'S TO BE INCONSTANT AND FORGET THOSE THEY DO LOVE,
OR HAVE LOVED.  I BELIEVE THE REVERSE.  I BELIEVE IN A TRUE ANALOGY
BETWEEN OUR BODILY FRAMES AND OUR MENTAL; AND THAT AS OUR BODIES ARE
THE STRONGEST, SO ARE OUR FEELINGS; CAPABLE OF BEARING MOST ROUGH USAGE,
AND RIDING OUT THE HEAVIEST WEATHER."

"YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE THE STRONGEST," REPLIED ANNE, "BUT THE SAME SPIRIT
OF ANALOGY WILL AUTHORISE ME TO ASSERT THAT OURS ARE THE MOST TENDER.
MAN IS MORE ROBUST THAN WOMAN, BUT HE IS NOT LONGER LIVED;
WHICH EXACTLY EXPLAINS MY VIEW OF THE NATURE OF THEIR ATTACHMENTS.
NAY, IT WOULD BE TOO HARD UPON YOU, IF IT WERE OTHERWISE.
YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES, AND PRIVATIONS, AND DANGERS ENOUGH TO STRUGGLE WITH.
YOU ARE ALWAYS LABOURING AND TOILING, EXPOSED TO EVERY RISK AND HARDSHIP.
YOUR HOME, COUNTRY, FRIENDS, ALL QUITTED.  NEITHER TIME, NOR HEALTH,
NOR LIFE, TO BE CALLED YOUR OWN.  IT WOULD BE HARD, INDEED"
(WITH A FALTERING VOICE), "IF WOMAN'S FEELINGS WERE TO BE
ADDED TO ALL THIS."

"WE SHALL NEVER AGREE UPON THIS QUESTION," CAPTAIN HARVILLE
WAS BEGINNING TO SAY, WHEN A SLIGHT NOISE CALLED THEIR ATTENTION
TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S HITHERTO PERFECTLY QUIET DIVISION OF THE ROOM.
IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT HIS PEN HAD FALLEN DOWN; BUT ANNE WAS
STARTLED AT FINDING HIM NEARER THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED, AND HALF INCLINED
TO SUSPECT THAT THE PEN HAD ONLY FALLEN BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN
OCCUPIED BY THEM, STRIVING TO CATCH SOUNDS, WHICH YET SHE DID NOT THINK
HE COULD HAVE CAUGHT.

"HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR LETTER?" SAID CAPTAIN HARVILLE.

"NOT QUITE, A FEW LINES MORE.  I SHALL HAVE DONE IN FIVE MINUTES."

"THERE IS NO HURRY ON MY SIDE.  I AM ONLY READY WHENEVER YOU ARE.
I AM IN VERY GOOD ANCHORAGE HERE," (SMILING AT ANNE,) "WELL SUPPLIED,
AND WANT FOR NOTHING.  NO HURRY FOR A SIGNAL AT ALL.  WELL, MISS ELLIOT,"
(LOWERING HIS VOICE,) "AS I WAS SAYING WE SHALL NEVER AGREE,
I SUPPOSE, UPON THIS POINT.  NO MAN AND WOMAN, WOULD, PROBABLY.
BUT LET ME OBSERVE THAT ALL HISTORIES ARE AGAINST YOU--ALL STORIES,
PROSE AND VERSE.  IF I HAD SUCH A MEMORY AS BENWICK, I COULD BRING YOU
FIFTY QUOTATIONS IN A MOMENT ON MY SIDE THE ARGUMENT, AND I DO NOT THINK
I EVER OPENED A BOOK IN MY LIFE WHICH HAD NOT SOMETHING TO SAY
UPON WOMAN'S INCONSTANCY.  SONGS AND PROVERBS, ALL TALK
OF WOMAN'S FICKLENESS.  BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL SAY, THESE WERE ALL
WRITTEN BY MEN."

"PERHAPS I SHALL.  YES, YES, IF YOU PLEASE, NO REFERENCE TO EXAMPLES
IN BOOKS.  MEN HAVE HAD EVERY ADVANTAGE OF US IN TELLING THEIR OWN STORY.
EDUCATION HAS BEEN THEIRS IN SO MUCH HIGHER A DEGREE; THE PEN HAS
BEEN IN THEIR HANDS.  I WILL NOT ALLOW BOOKS TO PROVE ANYTHING."

"BUT HOW SHALL WE PROVE ANYTHING?"

"WE NEVER SHALL.  WE NEVER CAN EXPECT TO PROVE ANY THING UPON SUCH A POINT.
IT IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT OF PROOF.
WE EACH BEGIN, PROBABLY, WITH A LITTLE BIAS TOWARDS OUR OWN SEX;
AND UPON THAT BIAS BUILD EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOUR OF IT
WHICH HAS OCCURRED WITHIN OUR OWN CIRCLE; MANY OF WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES
(PERHAPS THOSE VERY CASES WHICH STRIKE US THE MOST) MAY BE PRECISELY SUCH
AS CANNOT BE BROUGHT FORWARD WITHOUT BETRAYING A CONFIDENCE,
OR IN SOME RESPECT SAYING WHAT SHOULD NOT BE SAID."

"AH!" CRIED CAPTAIN HARVILLE, IN A TONE OF STRONG FEELING,
"IF I COULD BUT MAKE YOU COMPREHEND WHAT A MAN SUFFERS WHEN HE TAKES
A LAST LOOK AT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN, AND WATCHES THE BOAT
THAT HE HAS SENT THEM OFF IN, AS LONG AS IT IS IN SIGHT,
AND THEN TURNS AWAY AND SAYS, `GOD KNOWS WHETHER WE EVER MEET AGAIN!'
AND THEN, IF I COULD CONVEY TO YOU THE GLOW OF HIS SOUL WHEN HE DOES
SEE THEM AGAIN; WHEN, COMING BACK AFTER A TWELVEMONTH'S ABSENCE,
PERHAPS, AND OBLIGED TO PUT INTO ANOTHER PORT, HE CALCULATES HOW SOON
IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET THEM THERE, PRETENDING TO DECEIVE HIMSELF,
AND SAYING, `THEY CANNOT BE HERE TILL SUCH A DAY,' BUT ALL THE WHILE
HOPING FOR THEM TWELVE HOURS SOONER, AND SEEING THEM ARRIVE AT LAST,
AS IF HEAVEN HAD GIVEN THEM WINGS, BY MANY HOURS SOONER STILL!
IF I COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU ALL THIS, AND ALL THAT A MAN CAN BEAR AND DO,
AND GLORIES TO DO, FOR THE SAKE OF THESE TREASURES OF HIS EXISTENCE!
I SPEAK, YOU KNOW, ONLY OF SUCH MEN AS HAVE HEARTS!" PRESSING HIS OWN
WITH EMOTION.

"OH!" CRIED ANNE EAGERLY, "I HOPE I DO JUSTICE TO ALL THAT IS FELT BY YOU,
AND BY THOSE WHO RESEMBLE YOU.  GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD UNDERVALUE
THE WARM AND FAITHFUL FEELINGS OF ANY OF MY FELLOW-CREATURES!
I SHOULD DESERVE UTTER CONTEMPT IF I DARED TO SUPPOSE THAT TRUE ATTACHMENT
AND CONSTANCY WERE KNOWN ONLY BY WOMAN.  NO, I BELIEVE YOU CAPABLE
OF EVERYTHING GREAT AND GOOD IN YOUR MARRIED LIVES.  I BELIEVE YOU EQUAL
TO EVERY IMPORTANT EXERTION, AND TO EVERY DOMESTIC FORBEARANCE,
SO LONG AS--IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE EXPRESSION--SO LONG AS YOU HAVE
AN OBJECT.  I MEAN WHILE THE WOMAN YOU LOVE LIVES, AND LIVES FOR YOU.
ALL THE PRIVILEGE I CLAIM FOR MY OWN SEX (IT IS NOT A VERY ENVIABLE ONE;
YOU NEED NOT COVET IT), IS THAT OF LOVING LONGEST, WHEN EXISTENCE
OR WHEN HOPE IS GONE."

SHE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY HAVE UTTERED ANOTHER SENTENCE; HER HEART
WAS TOO FULL, HER BREATH TOO MUCH OPPRESSED.

"YOU ARE A GOOD SOUL," CRIED CAPTAIN HARVILLE, PUTTING HIS HAND
ON HER ARM, QUITE AFFECTIONATELY.  "THERE IS NO QUARRELLING WITH YOU.
AND WHEN I THINK OF BENWICK, MY TONGUE IS TIED."

THEIR ATTENTION WAS CALLED TOWARDS THE OTHERS.  MRS CROFT WAS TAKING LEAVE.

"HERE, FREDERICK, YOU AND I PART COMPANY, I BELIEVE," SAID SHE.
"I AM GOING HOME, AND YOU HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT WITH YOUR FRIEND.
TO-NIGHT WE MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ALL MEETING AGAIN AT YOUR PARTY,"
(TURNING TO ANNE.)  "WE HAD YOUR SISTER'S CARD YESTERDAY,
AND I UNDERSTOOD FREDERICK HAD A CARD TOO, THOUGH I DID NOT SEE IT;
AND YOU ARE DISENGAGED, FREDERICK, ARE YOU NOT, AS WELL AS OURSELVES?"

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS FOLDING UP A LETTER IN GREAT HASTE, AND EITHER
COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT ANSWER FULLY.

"YES," SAID HE, "VERY TRUE; HERE WE SEPARATE, BUT HARVILLE AND I
SHALL SOON BE AFTER YOU; THAT IS, HARVILLE, IF YOU ARE READY,
I AM IN HALF A MINUTE.  I KNOW YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY TO BE OFF.
I SHALL BE AT YOUR SERVICE IN HALF A MINUTE."

MRS CROFT LEFT THEM, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, HAVING SEALED HIS LETTER
WITH GREAT RAPIDITY, WAS INDEED READY, AND HAD EVEN A HURRIED,
AGITATED AIR, WHICH SHEWED IMPATIENCE TO BE GONE.  ANNE KNEW NOT HOW
TO UNDERSTAND IT.  SHE HAD THE KINDEST "GOOD MORNING, GOD BLESS YOU!"
FROM CAPTAIN HARVILLE, BUT FROM HIM NOT A WORD, NOR A LOOK!
HE HAD PASSED OUT OF THE ROOM WITHOUT A LOOK!

SHE HAD ONLY TIME, HOWEVER, TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE TABLE WHERE
HE HAD BEEN WRITING, WHEN FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD RETURNING;
THE DOOR OPENED, IT WAS HIMSELF.  HE BEGGED THEIR PARDON,
BUT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS GLOVES, AND INSTANTLY CROSSING THE ROOM
TO THE WRITING TABLE, HE DREW OUT A LETTER FROM UNDER THE SCATTERED PAPER,
PLACED IT BEFORE ANNE WITH EYES OF GLOWING ENTREATY FIXED ON HER
FOR A TIME, AND HASTILY COLLECTING HIS GLOVES, WAS AGAIN OUT OF THE ROOM,
ALMOST BEFORE MRS MUSGROVE WAS AWARE OF HIS BEING IN IT:
THE WORK OF AN INSTANT!

THE REVOLUTION WHICH ONE INSTANT HAD MADE IN ANNE, WAS ALMOST
BEYOND EXPRESSION.  THE LETTER, WITH A DIRECTION HARDLY LEGIBLE,
TO "MISS A. E.--," WAS EVIDENTLY THE ONE WHICH HE HAD BEEN FOLDING
SO HASTILY.  WHILE SUPPOSED TO BE WRITING ONLY TO CAPTAIN BENWICK,
HE HAD BEEN ALSO ADDRESSING HER!  ON THE CONTENTS OF THAT LETTER
DEPENDED ALL WHICH THIS WORLD COULD DO FOR HER.  ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE,
ANYTHING MIGHT BE DEFIED RATHER THAN SUSPENSE.  MRS MUSGROVE HAD
LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS OF HER OWN AT HER OWN TABLE; TO THEIR PROTECTION
SHE MUST TRUST, AND SINKING INTO THE CHAIR WHICH HE HAD OCCUPIED,
SUCCEEDING TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE HAD LEANED AND WRITTEN,
HER EYES DEVOURED THE FOLLOWING WORDS:


"I CAN LISTEN NO LONGER IN SILENCE.  I MUST SPEAK TO YOU BY SUCH MEANS
AS ARE WITHIN MY REACH.  YOU PIERCE MY SOUL.  I AM HALF AGONY,
HALF HOPE.  TELL ME NOT THAT I AM TOO LATE, THAT SUCH PRECIOUS FEELINGS
ARE GONE FOR EVER.  I OFFER MYSELF TO YOU AGAIN WITH A HEART
EVEN MORE YOUR OWN THAN WHEN YOU ALMOST BROKE IT, EIGHT YEARS
AND A HALF AGO.  DARE NOT SAY THAT MAN FORGETS SOONER THAN  WOMAN,
THAT HIS LOVE HAS AN EARLIER DEATH.  I HAVE LOVED NONE BUT YOU.
UNJUST I MAY HAVE BEEN, WEAK AND RESENTFUL I HAVE BEEN,
BUT NEVER INCONSTANT.  YOU ALONE HAVE BROUGHT ME TO BATH.
FOR YOU ALONE, I THINK AND PLAN.  HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THIS?
CAN YOU FAIL TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD MY WISHES?  I HAD NOT WAITED EVEN
THESE TEN DAYS, COULD I HAVE READ YOUR FEELINGS, AS I THINK YOU MUST HAVE
PENETRATED MINE.  I CAN HARDLY WRITE.  I AM EVERY INSTANT HEARING
SOMETHING WHICH OVERPOWERS ME.  YOU SINK YOUR VOICE, BUT I CAN
DISTINGUISH THE TONES OF THAT VOICE WHEN THEY WOULD BE LOST ON OTHERS.
TOO GOOD, TOO EXCELLENT CREATURE!  YOU DO US JUSTICE, INDEED.
YOU DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS TRUE ATTACHMENT AND CONSTANCY AMONG MEN.
BELIEVE IT TO BE MOST FERVENT, MOST UNDEVIATING, IN F. W.

"I MUST GO, UNCERTAIN OF MY FATE; BUT I SHALL RETURN HITHER,
OR FOLLOW YOUR PARTY, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  A WORD, A LOOK,
WILL BE ENOUGH TO DECIDE WHETHER I ENTER YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE
THIS EVENING OR NEVER."


SUCH A LETTER WAS NOT TO BE SOON RECOVERED FROM.  HALF AND HOUR'S SOLITUDE
AND REFLECTION MIGHT HAVE TRANQUILLIZED HER; BUT THE TEN MINUTES ONLY
WHICH NOW PASSED BEFORE SHE WAS INTERRUPTED, WITH ALL THE RESTRAINTS
OF HER SITUATION, COULD DO NOTHING TOWARDS TRANQUILLITY.  EVERY MOMENT
RATHER BROUGHT FRESH AGITATION.  IT WAS OVERPOWERING HAPPINESS.
AND BEFORE SHE WAS BEYOND THE FIRST STAGE OF FULL SENSATION,
CHARLES, MARY, AND HENRIETTA ALL CAME IN.

THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF SEEMING LIKE HERSELF PRODUCED THEN
AN IMMEDIATE STRUGGLE; BUT AFTER A WHILE SHE COULD DO NO MORE.
SHE BEGAN NOT TO UNDERSTAND A WORD THEY SAID, AND WAS OBLIGED
TO PLEAD INDISPOSITION AND EXCUSE HERSELF.  THEY COULD THEN SEE
THAT SHE LOOKED VERY ILL, WERE SHOCKED AND CONCERNED, AND WOULD NOT
STIR WITHOUT HER FOR THE WORLD.  THIS WAS DREADFUL.  WOULD THEY ONLY
HAVE GONE AWAY, AND LEFT HER IN THE QUIET POSSESSION OF THAT ROOM
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER CURE; BUT TO HAVE THEM ALL STANDING OR
WAITING AROUND HER WAS DISTRACTING, AND IN DESPERATION,
SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO HOME.

"BY ALL MEANS, MY DEAR," CRIED MRS MUSGROVE, "GO HOME DIRECTLY,
AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, THAT YOU MAY BE FIT FOR THE EVENING.
I WISH SARAH WAS HERE TO DOCTOR YOU, BUT I AM NO DOCTOR MYSELF.
CHARLES, RING AND ORDER A CHAIR.  SHE MUST NOT WALK."

BUT THE CHAIR WOULD NEVER DO.  WORSE THAN ALL!  TO LOSE THE POSSIBILITY
OF SPEAKING TWO WORDS TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IN THE COURSE OF HER QUIET,
SOLITARY PROGRESS UP THE TOWN (AND SHE FELT ALMOST CERTAIN OF MEETING HIM)
COULD NOT BE BORNE.  THE CHAIR WAS EARNESTLY PROTESTED AGAINST,
AND MRS MUSGROVE, WHO THOUGHT ONLY OF ONE SORT OF ILLNESS,
HAVING ASSURED HERSELF WITH SOME ANXIETY, THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO FALL
IN THE CASE; THAT ANNE HAD NOT AT ANY TIME LATELY SLIPPED DOWN,
AND GOT A BLOW ON HER HEAD; THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HAVING
HAD NO FALL; COULD PART WITH HER CHEERFULLY, AND DEPEND ON
FINDING HER BETTER AT NIGHT.

ANXIOUS TO OMIT NO POSSIBLE PRECAUTION, ANNE STRUGGLED, AND SAID--

"I AM AFRAID, MA'AM, THAT IT IS NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD.
PRAY BE SO GOOD AS TO MENTION TO THE OTHER GENTLEMEN THAT WE HOPE
TO SEE YOUR WHOLE PARTY THIS EVENING.  I AM AFRAID THERE HAD BEEN
SOME MISTAKE; AND I WISH YOU PARTICULARLY TO ASSURE CAPTAIN HARVILLE
AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, THAT WE HOPE TO SEE THEM BOTH."

"OH! MY DEAR, IT IS QUITE UNDERSTOOD, I GIVE YOU MY WORD.
CAPTAIN HARVILLE HAS NO THOUGHT BUT OF GOING."

"DO YOU THINK SO?  BUT I AM AFRAID; AND I SHOULD BE SO VERY SORRY.
WILL YOU PROMISE ME TO MENTION IT, WHEN YOU SEE THEM AGAIN?
YOU WILL SEE THEM BOTH THIS MORNING, I DARE SAY.  DO PROMISE ME."

"TO BE SURE I WILL, IF YOU WISH IT.  CHARLES, IF YOU SEE CAPTAIN HARVILLE
ANYWHERE, REMEMBER TO GIVE MISS ANNE'S MESSAGE.  BUT INDEED, MY DEAR,
YOU NEED NOT BE UNEASY.  CAPTAIN HARVILLE HOLDS HIMSELF QUITE ENGAGED,
I'LL ANSWER FOR IT; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THE SAME, I DARE SAY."

ANNE COULD DO NO MORE; BUT HER HEART PROPHESIED SOME MISCHANCE
TO DAMP THE PERFECTION OF HER FELICITY.  IT COULD NOT BE VERY LASTING,
HOWEVER.  EVEN IF HE DID NOT COME TO CAMDEN PLACE HIMSELF,
IT WOULD BE IN HER POWER TO SEND AN INTELLIGIBLE SENTENCE
BY CAPTAIN HARVILLE.  ANOTHER MOMENTARY VEXATION OCCURRED.
CHARLES, IN HIS REAL CONCERN AND GOOD NATURE, WOULD GO HOME WITH HER;
THERE WAS NO PREVENTING HIM.  THIS WAS ALMOST CRUEL.  BUT SHE COULD NOT
BE LONG UNGRATEFUL; HE WAS SACRIFICING AN ENGAGEMENT AT A GUNSMITH'S,
TO BE OF USE TO HER; AND SHE SET OFF WITH HIM, WITH NO FEELING
BUT GRATITUDE APPARENT.

THEY WERE ON UNION STREET, WHEN A QUICKER STEP BEHIND, A SOMETHING
OF FAMILIAR SOUND, GAVE HER TWO MOMENTS' PREPARATION FOR THE SIGHT
OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  HE JOINED THEM; BUT, AS IF IRRESOLUTE
WHETHER TO JOIN OR TO PASS ON, SAID NOTHING, ONLY LOOKED.
ANNE COULD COMMAND HERSELF ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THAT LOOK,
AND NOT REPULSIVELY.  THE CHEEKS WHICH HAD BEEN PALE NOW GLOWED,
AND THE MOVEMENTS WHICH HAD HESITATED WERE DECIDED.  HE WALKED BY HER SIDE.
PRESENTLY, STRUCK BY A SUDDEN THOUGHT, CHARLES SAID--

"CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING?  ONLY TO GAY STREET,
OR FARTHER UP THE TOWN?"

"I HARDLY KNOW," REPLIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, SURPRISED.

"ARE YOU GOING AS HIGH AS BELMONT?  ARE YOU GOING NEAR CAMDEN PLACE?
BECAUSE, IF YOU ARE, I SHALL HAVE NO SCRUPLE IN ASKING YOU
TO TAKE MY PLACE, AND GIVE ANNE YOUR ARM TO HER FATHER'S DOOR.
SHE IS RATHER DONE FOR THIS MORNING, AND MUST NOT GO SO FAR WITHOUT HELP,
AND I OUGHT TO BE AT THAT FELLOW'S IN THE MARKET PLACE.
HE PROMISED ME THE SIGHT OF A CAPITAL GUN HE IS JUST GOING TO SEND OFF;
SAID HE WOULD KEEP IT UNPACKED TO THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT,
THAT I MIGHT SEE IT; AND IF I DO NOT TURN BACK NOW, I HAVE NO CHANCE.
BY HIS DESCRIPTION, A GOOD DEAL LIKE THE SECOND SIZE DOUBLE-BARREL OF MINE,
WHICH YOU SHOT WITH ONE DAY ROUND WINTHROP."

THERE COULD NOT BE AN OBJECTION.  THERE COULD BE ONLY THE MOST
PROPER ALACRITY, A MOST OBLIGING COMPLIANCE FOR PUBLIC VIEW;
AND SMILES REINED IN AND SPIRITS DANCING IN PRIVATE RAPTURE.
IN HALF A MINUTE CHARLES WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF UNION STREET AGAIN,
AND THE OTHER TWO PROCEEDING TOGETHER:  AND SOON WORDS ENOUGH HAD PASSED
BETWEEN THEM TO DECIDE THEIR DIRECTION TOWARDS THE COMPARATIVELY QUIET
AND RETIRED GRAVEL WALK, WHERE THE POWER OF CONVERSATION WOULD MAKE
THE PRESENT HOUR A BLESSING INDEED, AND PREPARE IT FOR ALL
THE IMMORTALITY WHICH THE HAPPIEST RECOLLECTIONS OF THEIR OWN FUTURE LIVES
COULD BESTOW.  THERE THEY EXCHANGED AGAIN THOSE FEELINGS
AND THOSE PROMISES WHICH HAD ONCE BEFORE SEEMED TO SECURE EVERYTHING,
BUT WHICH HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY SO MANY, MANY YEARS OF DIVISION
AND ESTRANGEMENT.  THERE THEY RETURNED AGAIN INTO THE PAST,
MORE EXQUISITELY HAPPY, PERHAPS, IN THEIR RE-UNION, THAN WHEN
IT HAD BEEN FIRST PROJECTED; MORE TENDER, MORE TRIED, MORE FIXED
IN A KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER'S CHARACTER, TRUTH, AND ATTACHMENT;
MORE EQUAL TO ACT, MORE JUSTIFIED IN ACTING.  AND THERE, AS THEY SLOWLY
PACED THE GRADUAL ASCENT, HEEDLESS OF EVERY GROUP AROUND THEM,
SEEING NEITHER SAUNTERING POLITICIANS, BUSTLING HOUSEKEEPERS,
FLIRTING GIRLS, NOR NURSERY-MAIDS AND CHILDREN, THEY COULD INDULGE IN
THOSE RETROSPECTIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, AND ESPECIALLY IN
THOSE EXPLANATIONS OF WHAT HAD DIRECTLY PRECEDED THE PRESENT MOMENT,
WHICH WERE SO POIGNANT AND SO CEASELESS IN INTEREST.  ALL THE LITTLE
VARIATIONS OF THE LAST WEEK WERE GONE THROUGH; AND OF YESTERDAY
AND TODAY THERE COULD SCARCELY BE AN END.

SHE HAD NOT MISTAKEN HIM.  JEALOUSY OF MR ELLIOT HAD BEEN
THE RETARDING WEIGHT, THE DOUBT, THE TORMENT.  THAT HAD BEGUN TO OPERATE
IN THE VERY HOUR OF FIRST MEETING HER IN BATH; THAT HAD RETURNED,
AFTER A SHORT SUSPENSION, TO RUIN THE CONCERT; AND THAT HAD INFLUENCED HIM
IN EVERYTHING HE HAD SAID AND DONE, OR OMITTED TO SAY AND DO,
IN THE LAST FOUR-AND-TWENTY HOURS.  IT HAD BEEN GRADUALLY YIELDING
TO THE BETTER HOPES WHICH HER LOOKS, OR WORDS, OR ACTIONS
OCCASIONALLY ENCOURAGED; IT HAD BEEN VANQUISHED AT LAST BY
THOSE SENTIMENTS AND THOSE TONES WHICH HAD REACHED HIM WHILE SHE TALKED
WITH CAPTAIN HARVILLE; AND UNDER THE IRRESISTIBLE GOVERNANCE OF WHICH
HE HAD SEIZED A SHEET OF PAPER, AND POURED OUT HIS FEELINGS.

OF WHAT HE HAD THEN WRITTEN, NOTHING WAS TO BE RETRACTED OR QUALIFIED.
HE PERSISTED IN HAVING LOVED NONE BUT HER.  SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SUPPLANTED.
HE NEVER EVEN BELIEVED HIMSELF TO SEE HER EQUAL.  THUS MUCH INDEED
HE WAS OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE:  THAT HE HAD BEEN CONSTANT UNCONSCIOUSLY,
NAY UNINTENTIONALLY; THAT HE HAD MEANT TO FORGET HER, AND BELIEVED IT
TO BE DONE.  HE HAD IMAGINED HIMSELF INDIFFERENT, WHEN HE HAD ONLY
BEEN ANGRY; AND HE HAD BEEN UNJUST TO HER MERITS, BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN
A SUFFERER FROM THEM.  HER CHARACTER WAS NOW FIXED ON HIS MIND
AS PERFECTION ITSELF, MAINTAINING THE LOVELIEST MEDIUM OF FORTITUDE
AND GENTLENESS; BUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ONLY AT UPPERCROSS
HAD HE LEARNT TO DO HER JUSTICE, AND ONLY AT LYME HAD HE BEGUN
TO UNDERSTAND HIMSELF.  AT LYME, HE HAD RECEIVED LESSONS
OF MORE THAN ONE SORT.  THE PASSING ADMIRATION OF MR ELLIOT
HAD AT LEAST ROUSED HIM, AND THE SCENES ON THE COBB AND AT
CAPTAIN HARVILLE'S HAD FIXED HER SUPERIORITY.

IN HIS PRECEDING ATTEMPTS TO ATTACH HIMSELF TO LOUISA MUSGROVE
(THE ATTEMPTS OF ANGRY PRIDE), HE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD FOR EVER
FELT IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE; THAT HE HAD NOT CARED, COULD NOT CARE,
FOR LOUISA; THOUGH TILL THAT DAY, TILL THE LEISURE FOR REFLECTION
WHICH FOLLOWED IT, HE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD THE PERFECT EXCELLENCE
OF THE MIND WITH WHICH LOUISA'S COULD SO ILL BEAR A COMPARISON,
OR THE PERFECT UNRIVALLED HOLD IT POSSESSED OVER HIS OWN.
THERE, HE HAD LEARNT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE STEADINESS OF PRINCIPLE
AND THE OBSTINACY OF SELF-WILL, BETWEEN THE DARINGS OF HEEDLESSNESS
AND THE RESOLUTION OF A COLLECTED MIND.  THERE HE HAD SEEN EVERYTHING
TO EXALT IN HIS ESTIMATION THE WOMAN HE HAD LOST; AND THERE BEGUN
TO DEPLORE THE PRIDE, THE FOLLY, THE MADNESS OF RESENTMENT,
WHICH HAD KEPT HIM FROM TRYING TO REGAIN HER WHEN THROWN IN HIS WAY.

FROM THAT PERIOD HIS PENANCE HAD BECOME SEVERE.  HE HAD NO SOONER
BEEN FREE FROM THE HORROR AND REMORSE ATTENDING THE FIRST FEW DAYS
OF LOUISA'S ACCIDENT, NO SOONER BEGUN TO FEEL HIMSELF ALIVE AGAIN,
THAN HE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL HIMSELF, THOUGH ALIVE, NOT AT LIBERTY.

"I FOUND," SAID HE, "THAT I WAS CONSIDERED BY HARVILLE AN ENGAGED MAN!
THAT NEITHER HARVILLE NOR HIS WIFE ENTERTAINED A DOUBT OF OUR
MUTUAL ATTACHMENT.  I WAS STARTLED AND SHOCKED.  TO A DEGREE,
I COULD CONTRADICT THIS INSTANTLY; BUT, WHEN I BEGAN TO REFLECT
THAT OTHERS MIGHT HAVE FELT THE SAME--HER OWN FAMILY, NAY,
PERHAPS HERSELF--I WAS NO LONGER AT MY OWN DISPOSAL.  I WAS HERS IN HONOUR
IF SHE WISHED IT.  I HAD BEEN UNGUARDED.  I HAD NOT THOUGHT SERIOUSLY
ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE.  I HAD NOT CONSIDERED THAT MY EXCESSIVE INTIMACY
MUST HAVE ITS DANGER OF ILL CONSEQUENCE IN MANY WAYS; AND THAT I HAD
NO RIGHT TO BE TRYING WHETHER I COULD ATTACH MYSELF TO EITHER OF THE GIRLS,
AT THE RISK OF RAISING EVEN AN UNPLEASANT REPORT, WERE THERE NO OTHER
ILL EFFECTS.  I HAD BEEN GROSSLY WRONG, AND MUST ABIDE THE CONSEQUENCES."

HE FOUND TOO LATE, IN SHORT, THAT HE HAD ENTANGLED HIMSELF;
AND THAT PRECISELY AS HE BECAME FULLY SATISFIED OF HIS NOT CARING
FOR LOUISA AT ALL, HE MUST REGARD HIMSELF AS BOUND TO HER,
IF HER SENTIMENTS FOR HIM WERE WHAT THE HARVILLES SUPPOSED.
IT DETERMINED HIM TO LEAVE LYME, AND AWAIT HER COMPLETE RECOVERY ELSEWHERE.
HE WOULD GLADLY WEAKEN, BY ANY FAIR MEANS, WHATEVER FEELINGS OR
SPECULATIONS CONCERNING HIM MIGHT EXIST; AND HE WENT, THEREFORE,
TO HIS BROTHER'S, MEANING AFTER A WHILE TO RETURN TO KELLYNCH,
AND ACT AS CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT REQUIRE.

"I WAS SIX WEEKS WITH EDWARD," SAID HE, "AND SAW HIM HAPPY.
I COULD HAVE NO OTHER PLEASURE.  I DESERVED NONE.  HE ENQUIRED AFTER YOU
VERY PARTICULARLY; ASKED EVEN IF YOU WERE PERSONALLY ALTERED,
LITTLE SUSPECTING THAT TO MY EYE YOU COULD NEVER ALTER."

ANNE SMILED, AND LET IT PASS.  IT WAS TOO PLEASING A BLUNDER
FOR A REPROACH.  IT IS SOMETHING FOR A WOMAN TO BE ASSURED,
IN HER EIGHT-AND-TWENTIETH YEAR, THAT SHE HAS NOT LOST ONE CHARM
OF EARLIER YOUTH; BUT THE VALUE OF SUCH HOMAGE WAS INEXPRESSIBLY INCREASED
TO ANNE, BY COMPARING IT WITH FORMER WORDS, AND FEELING IT TO BE
THE RESULT, NOT THE CAUSE OF A REVIVAL OF HIS WARM ATTACHMENT.

HE HAD REMAINED IN SHROPSHIRE, LAMENTING THE BLINDNESS OF HIS OWN PRIDE,
AND THE BLUNDERS OF HIS OWN CALCULATIONS, TILL AT ONCE RELEASED FROM LOUISA
BY THE ASTONISHING AND FELICITOUS INTELLIGENCE OF HER ENGAGEMENT
WITH BENWICK.

"HERE," SAID HE, "ENDED THE WORST OF MY STATE; FOR NOW I COULD AT LEAST
PUT MYSELF IN THE WAY OF HAPPINESS; I COULD EXERT MYSELF;
I COULD DO SOMETHING.  BUT TO BE WAITING SO LONG IN INACTION,
AND WAITING ONLY FOR EVIL, HAD BEEN DREADFUL.  WITHIN THE FIRST
FIVE MINUTES I SAID, `I WILL BE AT BATH ON WEDNESDAY,' AND I WAS.
WAS IT UNPARDONABLE TO THINK IT WORTH MY WHILE TO COME? AND TO ARRIVE
WITH SOME DEGREE OF HOPE?  YOU WERE SINGLE.  IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT
YOU MIGHT RETAIN THE FEELINGS OF THE PAST, AS I DID; AND ONE ENCOURAGEMENT
HAPPENED TO BE MINE.  I COULD NEVER DOUBT THAT YOU WOULD BE LOVED AND
SOUGHT BY OTHERS, BUT I KNEW TO A CERTAINTY THAT YOU HAD REFUSED ONE MAN,
AT LEAST, OF BETTER PRETENSIONS THAN MYSELF; AND I COULD NOT HELP
OFTEN SAYING, `WAS THIS FOR ME?'"

THEIR FIRST MEETING IN MILSOM STREET AFFORDED MUCH TO BE SAID,
BUT THE CONCERT STILL MORE.  THAT EVENING SEEMED TO BE MADE UP
OF EXQUISITE MOMENTS.  THE MOMENT OF HER STEPPING FORWARD
IN THE OCTAGON ROOM TO SPEAK TO HIM:  THE MOMENT OF MR ELLIOT'S APPEARING
AND TEARING HER AWAY, AND ONE OR TWO SUBSEQUENT MOMENTS,
MARKED BY RETURNING HOPE OR INCREASING DESPONDENCY, WERE DWELT ON
WITH ENERGY.

"TO SEE YOU," CRIED HE, "IN THE MIDST OF THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE
MY WELL-WISHERS; TO SEE YOUR COUSIN CLOSE BY YOU, CONVERSING AND SMILING,
AND FEEL ALL THE HORRIBLE ELIGIBILITIES AND PROPRIETIES OF THE MATCH!
TO CONSIDER IT AS THE CERTAIN WISH OF EVERY BEING WHO COULD HOPE
TO INFLUENCE YOU!  EVEN IF YOUR OWN FEELINGS WERE RELUCTANT OR INDIFFERENT,
TO CONSIDER WHAT POWERFUL SUPPORTS WOULD BE HIS!  WAS IT NOT ENOUGH
TO MAKE THE FOOL OF ME WHICH I APPEARED?  HOW COULD I LOOK ON
WITHOUT AGONY?  WAS NOT THE VERY SIGHT OF THE FRIEND WHO SAT BEHIND YOU,
WAS NOT THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD BEEN, THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER INFLUENCE,
THE INDELIBLE, IMMOVEABLE IMPRESSION OF WHAT PERSUASION HAD ONCE DONE--
WAS IT NOT ALL AGAINST ME?"

"YOU SHOULD HAVE DISTINGUISHED," REPLIED ANNE.  "YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE
SUSPECTED ME NOW; THE CASE IS SO DIFFERENT, AND MY AGE IS SO DIFFERENT.
IF I WAS WRONG IN YIELDING TO PERSUASION ONCE, REMEMBER THAT
IT WAS TO PERSUASION EXERTED ON THE SIDE OF SAFETY, NOT OF RISK.
WHEN I YIELDED, I THOUGHT IT WAS TO DUTY, BUT NO DUTY COULD BE CALLED
IN AID HERE.  IN MARRYING A MAN INDIFFERENT TO ME, ALL RISK
WOULD HAVE BEEN INCURRED, AND ALL DUTY VIOLATED."

"PERHAPS I OUGHT TO HAVE REASONED THUS," HE REPLIED, "BUT I COULD NOT.
I COULD NOT DERIVE BENEFIT FROM THE LATE KNOWLEDGE I HAD ACQUIRED
OF YOUR CHARACTER.  I COULD NOT BRING IT INTO PLAY; IT WAS OVERWHELMED,
BURIED, LOST IN THOSE EARLIER FEELINGS WHICH I HAD BEEN SMARTING UNDER
YEAR AFTER YEAR.  I COULD THINK OF YOU ONLY AS ONE WHO HAD YIELDED,
WHO HAD GIVEN ME UP, WHO HAD BEEN INFLUENCED BY ANY ONE RATHER THAN BY ME.
I SAW YOU WITH THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD GUIDED YOU IN THAT YEAR OF MISERY.
I HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE HER OF LESS AUTHORITY NOW.  THE FORCE OF HABIT
WAS TO BE ADDED."

"I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT," SAID ANNE, "THAT MY MANNER TO YOURSELF
MIGHT HAVE SPARED YOU MUCH OR ALL OF THIS."

"NO, NO! YOUR MANNER MIGHT BE ONLY THE EASE WHICH YOUR ENGAGEMENT
TO ANOTHER MAN WOULD GIVE.  I LEFT YOU IN THIS BELIEF; AND YET,
I WAS DETERMINED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.  MY SPIRITS RALLIED WITH THE MORNING,
AND I FELT THAT I HAD STILL A MOTIVE FOR REMAINING HERE."

AT LAST ANNE WAS AT HOME AGAIN, AND HAPPIER THAN ANY ONE IN THAT HOUSE
COULD HAVE CONCEIVED.  ALL THE SURPRISE AND SUSPENSE, AND EVERY OTHER
PAINFUL PART OF THE MORNING DISSIPATED BY THIS CONVERSATION,
SHE RE-ENTERED THE HOUSE SO HAPPY AS TO BE OBLIGED TO FIND AN ALLOY
IN SOME MOMENTARY APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO LAST.
AN INTERVAL OF MEDITATION, SERIOUS AND GRATEFUL, WAS THE BEST CORRECTIVE
OF EVERYTHING DANGEROUS IN SUCH HIGH-WROUGHT FELICITY; AND SHE WENT
TO HER ROOM, AND GREW STEADFAST AND FEARLESS IN THE THANKFULNESS
OF HER ENJOYMENT.

THE EVENING CAME, THE DRAWING-ROOMS WERE LIGHTED UP, THE COMPANY ASSEMBLED.
IT WAS BUT A CARD PARTY, IT WAS BUT A MIXTURE OF THOSE WHO HAD
NEVER MET BEFORE, AND THOSE WHO MET TOO OFTEN; A COMMONPLACE BUSINESS,
TOO NUMEROUS FOR INTIMACY, TOO SMALL FOR VARIETY; BUT ANNE HAD NEVER FOUND
AN EVENING SHORTER.  GLOWING AND LOVELY IN SENSIBILITY AND HAPPINESS,
AND MORE GENERALLY ADMIRED THAN SHE THOUGHT ABOUT OR CARED FOR,
SHE HAD CHEERFUL OR FORBEARING FEELINGS FOR EVERY CREATURE AROUND HER.
MR ELLIOT WAS THERE; SHE AVOIDED, BUT SHE COULD PITY HIM.
THE WALLISES, SHE HAD AMUSEMENT IN UNDERSTANDING THEM.  LADY DALRYMPLE
AND MISS CARTERET--THEY WOULD SOON BE INNOXIOUS COUSINS TO HER.
SHE CARED NOT FOR MRS CLAY, AND HAD NOTHING TO BLUSH FOR IN
THE PUBLIC MANNERS OF HER FATHER AND SISTER.  WITH THE MUSGROVES,
THERE WAS THE HAPPY CHAT OF PERFECT EASE; WITH CAPTAIN HARVILLE,
THE KIND-HEARTED INTERCOURSE OF BROTHER AND SISTER; WITH LADY RUSSELL,
ATTEMPTS AT CONVERSATION, WHICH A DELICIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS CUT SHORT;
WITH ADMIRAL AND MRS CROFT, EVERYTHING OF PECULIAR CORDIALITY AND
FERVENT INTEREST, WHICH THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS SOUGHT TO CONCEAL;
AND WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, SOME MOMENTS OF COMMUNICATIONS
CONTINUALLY OCCURRING, AND ALWAYS THE HOPE OF MORE, AND ALWAYS
THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS BEING THERE.

IT WAS IN ONE OF THESE SHORT MEETINGS, EACH APPARENTLY OCCUPIED
IN ADMIRING A FINE DISPLAY OF GREENHOUSE PLANTS, THAT SHE SAID--

"I HAVE BEEN THINKING OVER THE PAST, AND TRYING IMPARTIALLY
TO JUDGE OF THE RIGHT AND WRONG, I MEAN WITH REGARD TO MYSELF;
AND I MUST BELIEVE THAT I WAS RIGHT, MUCH AS I SUFFERED FROM IT,
THAT I WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT IN BEING GUIDED BY THE FRIEND WHOM
YOU WILL LOVE BETTER THAN YOU DO NOW.  TO ME, SHE WAS IN THE PLACE
OF A PARENT.  DO NOT MISTAKE ME, HOWEVER.  I AM NOT SAYING
THAT SHE DID NOT ERR IN HER ADVICE.  IT WAS, PERHAPS, ONE OF THOSE CASES
IN WHICH ADVICE IS GOOD OR BAD ONLY AS THE EVENT DECIDES;
AND FOR MYSELF, I CERTAINLY NEVER SHOULD, IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE
OF TOLERABLE SIMILARITY, GIVE SUCH ADVICE.  BUT I MEAN, THAT I WAS RIGHT
IN SUBMITTING TO HER, AND THAT IF I HAD DONE OTHERWISE, I SHOULD HAVE
SUFFERED MORE IN CONTINUING THE ENGAGEMENT THAN I DID EVEN IN GIVING IT UP,
BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED IN MY CONSCIENCE.  I HAVE NOW,
AS FAR AS SUCH A SENTIMENT IS ALLOWABLE IN HUMAN NATURE, NOTHING
TO REPROACH MYSELF WITH; AND IF I MISTAKE NOT, A STRONG SENSE OF DUTY
IS NO BAD PART OF A WOMAN'S PORTION."

HE LOOKED AT HER, LOOKED AT LADY RUSSELL, AND LOOKING AGAIN AT HER,
REPLIED, AS IF IN COOL DELIBERATION--

"NOT YET.  BUT THERE ARE HOPES OF HER BEING FORGIVEN IN TIME.
I TRUST TO BEING IN CHARITY WITH HER SOON.  BUT I TOO HAVE BEEN
THINKING OVER THE PAST, AND A  QUESTION HAS SUGGESTED ITSELF,
WHETHER THERE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ONE PERSON MORE MY ENEMY
EVEN THAN THAT LADY?  MY OWN SELF.  TELL ME IF, WHEN I RETURNED
TO ENGLAND IN THE YEAR EIGHT, WITH A FEW THOUSAND POUNDS,
AND WAS POSTED INTO THE LACONIA, IF I HAD THEN WRITTEN TO YOU,
WOULD YOU HAVE ANSWERED MY LETTER?  WOULD YOU, IN SHORT,
HAVE RENEWED THE ENGAGEMENT THEN?"

"WOULD I!" WAS ALL HER ANSWER; BUT THE ACCENT WAS DECISIVE ENOUGH.

"GOOD GOD!" HE CRIED, "YOU WOULD!  IT IS NOT THAT I DID NOT THINK OF IT,
OR DESIRE IT, AS WHAT COULD ALONE CROWN ALL MY OTHER SUCCESS;
BUT I WAS PROUD, TOO PROUD TO ASK AGAIN.  I DID NOT UNDERSTAND YOU.
I SHUT MY EYES, AND WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND YOU, OR DO YOU JUSTICE.
THIS IS A RECOLLECTION WHICH OUGHT TO MAKE ME FORGIVE EVERY ONE
SOONER THAN MYSELF.  SIX YEARS OF SEPARATION AND SUFFERING
MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED.  IT IS A SORT OF PAIN, TOO, WHICH IS NEW TO ME.
I HAVE BEEN USED TO THE GRATIFICATION OF BELIEVING MYSELF TO EARN
EVERY BLESSING THAT I ENJOYED.  I HAVE VALUED MYSELF ON HONOURABLE TOILS
AND JUST REWARDS.  LIKE OTHER GREAT MEN UNDER REVERSES," HE ADDED,
WITH A SMILE. "I MUST ENDEAVOUR TO SUBDUE MY MIND TO MY FORTUNE.
I MUST LEARN TO BROOK BEING HAPPIER THAN I DESERVE."



CHAPTER 24


WHO CAN BE IN DOUBT OF WHAT FOLLOWED?  WHEN ANY TWO YOUNG PEOPLE
TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO MARRY, THEY ARE PRETTY SURE BY PERSEVERANCE
TO CARRY THEIR POINT, BE THEY EVER SO POOR, OR EVER SO IMPRUDENT,
OR EVER SO LITTLE LIKELY TO BE NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER'S ULTIMATE COMFORT.
THIS MAY BE BAD MORALITY TO CONCLUDE WITH, BUT I BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUTH;
AND IF SUCH PARTIES SUCCEED, HOW SHOULD A CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AND
AN ANNE ELLIOT, WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF MATURITY OF MIND,
CONSCIOUSNESS OF RIGHT, AND ONE INDEPENDENT FORTUNE BETWEEN THEM,
FAIL OF BEARING DOWN EVERY OPPOSITION?  THEY MIGHT IN FACT,
HAVE BORNE DOWN A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THEY MET WITH, FOR THERE WAS
LITTLE TO DISTRESS THEM BEYOND THE WANT OF GRACIOUSNESS AND WARMTH.
SIR WALTER MADE NO OBJECTION, AND ELIZABETH DID NOTHING WORSE
THAN LOOK COLD AND UNCONCERNED.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WITH FIVE-AND-TWENTY
THOUSAND POUNDS, AND AS HIGH IN HIS PROFESSION AS MERIT AND ACTIVITY
COULD PLACE HIM, WAS NO LONGER NOBODY.  HE WAS NOW ESTEEMED QUITE WORTHY
TO ADDRESS THE DAUGHTER OF A FOOLISH, SPENDTHRIFT BARONET,
WHO HAD NOT HAD PRINCIPLE OR SENSE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF
IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD PLACED HIM, AND WHO COULD
GIVE HIS DAUGHTER AT PRESENT BUT A SMALL PART OF THE SHARE
OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH MUST BE HERS HEREAFTER.

SIR WALTER, INDEED, THOUGH HE HAD NO AFFECTION FOR ANNE,
AND NO VANITY FLATTERED, TO MAKE HIM REALLY HAPPY ON THE OCCASION,
WAS VERY FAR FROM THINKING IT A BAD MATCH FOR HER.  ON THE CONTRARY,
WHEN HE SAW MORE OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, SAW HIM REPEATEDLY BY DAYLIGHT,
AND EYED HIM WELL, HE WAS VERY MUCH STRUCK BY HIS PERSONAL CLAIMS,
AND FELT THAT HIS SUPERIORITY OF APPEARANCE MIGHT BE NOT UNFAIRLY BALANCED
AGAINST HER SUPERIORITY OF RANK; AND ALL THIS, ASSISTED BY
HIS WELL-SOUNDING NAME, ENABLED SIR WALTER AT LAST TO PREPARE HIS PEN,
WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE, FOR THE INSERTION OF THE MARRIAGE
IN THE VOLUME OF HONOUR.

THE ONLY ONE AMONG THEM, WHOSE OPPOSITION OF FEELING COULD EXCITE
ANY SERIOUS ANXIETY WAS LADY RUSSELL.  ANNE KNEW THAT LADY RUSSELL
MUST BE SUFFERING SOME PAIN IN UNDERSTANDING AND RELINQUISHING MR ELLIOT,
AND BE MAKING SOME STRUGGLES TO BECOME TRULY ACQUAINTED WITH,
AND DO JUSTICE TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  THIS HOWEVER WAS WHAT
LADY RUSSELL HAD NOW TO DO.  SHE MUST LEARN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD
BEEN MISTAKEN WITH REGARD TO BOTH; THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNFAIRLY INFLUENCED
BY APPEARANCES IN EACH; THAT BECAUSE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MANNERS
HAD NOT SUITED HER OWN IDEAS, SHE HAD BEEN TOO QUICK IN SUSPECTING THEM
TO INDICATE A CHARACTER OF DANGEROUS IMPETUOSITY; AND THAT BECAUSE
MR ELLIOT'S MANNERS HAD PRECISELY PLEASED HER IN THEIR PROPRIETY
AND CORRECTNESS, THEIR GENERAL POLITENESS AND SUAVITY, SHE HAD BEEN
TOO QUICK IN RECEIVING THEM AS THE CERTAIN RESULT OF THE MOST CORRECT
OPINIONS AND WELL-REGULATED MIND.  THERE WAS NOTHING LESS
FOR LADY RUSSELL TO DO, THAN TO ADMIT THAT SHE HAD BEEN
PRETTY COMPLETELY WRONG, AND TO TAKE UP A NEW SET OF OPINIONS
AND OF HOPES.

THERE IS A QUICKNESS OF PERCEPTION IN SOME, A NICETY IN THE DISCERNMENT
OF CHARACTER, A NATURAL PENETRATION, IN SHORT, WHICH NO EXPERIENCE
IN OTHERS CAN EQUAL, AND LADY RUSSELL HAD BEEN LESS GIFTED
IN THIS PART OF UNDERSTANDING THAN HER YOUNG FRIEND.  BUT SHE WAS
A VERY GOOD WOMAN, AND IF HER SECOND OBJECT WAS TO BE SENSIBLE
AND WELL-JUDGING, HER FIRST WAS TO SEE ANNE HAPPY.  SHE LOVED ANNE
BETTER THAN SHE LOVED HER OWN ABILITIES; AND WHEN THE AWKWARDNESS
OF THE BEGINNING WAS OVER, FOUND LITTLE HARDSHIP IN ATTACHING HERSELF
AS A MOTHER TO THE MAN WHO WAS SECURING THE HAPPINESS OF HER OTHER CHILD.

OF ALL THE FAMILY, MARY WAS PROBABLY THE ONE MOST IMMEDIATELY GRATIFIED
BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE.  IT WAS CREDITABLE TO HAVE A SISTER MARRIED,
AND SHE MIGHT FLATTER HERSELF WITH HAVING BEEN GREATLY INSTRUMENTAL
TO THE CONNEXION, BY KEEPING ANNE WITH HER IN THE AUTUMN;
AND AS HER OWN SISTER MUST BE BETTER THAN HER HUSBAND'S SISTERS,
IT WAS VERY AGREEABLE THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SHOULD BE A RICHER MAN THAN
EITHER CAPTAIN BENWICK OR CHARLES HAYTER.  SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SUFFER,
PERHAPS, WHEN THEY CAME INTO CONTACT AGAIN, IN SEEING ANNE RESTORED
TO THE RIGHTS OF SENIORITY, AND THE MISTRESS OF A VERY PRETTY LANDAULETTE;
BUT SHE HAD A FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO, OF POWERFUL CONSOLATION.
ANNE HAD NO UPPERCROSS HALL BEFORE HER, NO LANDED ESTATE,
NO HEADSHIP OF A FAMILY; AND IF THEY COULD BUT KEEP CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
FROM BEING MADE A BARONET, SHE WOULD NOT CHANGE SITUATIONS WITH ANNE.

IT WOULD BE WELL FOR THE ELDEST SISTER IF SHE WERE EQUALLY SATISFIED
WITH HER SITUATION, FOR A CHANGE IS NOT VERY PROBABLE THERE.
SHE HAD SOON THE MORTIFICATION OF SEEING MR ELLIOT WITHDRAW,
AND NO ONE OF PROPER CONDITION HAS SINCE PRESENTED HIMSELF TO RAISE
EVEN THE UNFOUNDED HOPES WHICH SUNK WITH HIM.

THE NEWS OF HIS COUSINS ANNE'S ENGAGEMENT BURST ON MR ELLIOT
MOST UNEXPECTEDLY.  IT DERANGED HIS BEST PLAN OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS,
HIS BEST HOPE OF KEEPING SIR WALTER SINGLE BY THE WATCHFULNESS
WHICH A SON-IN-LAW'S RIGHTS WOULD HAVE GIVEN.  BUT, THOUGH DISCOMFITED
AND DISAPPOINTED, HE COULD STILL DO SOMETHING FOR HIS OWN INTEREST
AND HIS OWN ENJOYMENT.  HE SOON QUITTED BATH; AND ON MRS CLAY'S
QUITTING IT SOON AFTERWARDS, AND BEING NEXT HEARD OF AS ESTABLISHED
UNDER HIS PROTECTION IN LONDON, IT WAS EVIDENT HOW DOUBLE A GAME
HE HAD BEEN PLAYING, AND HOW DETERMINED HE WAS TO SAVE HIMSELF
FROM BEING CUT OUT BY ONE ARTFUL WOMAN, AT LEAST.

MRS CLAY'S AFFECTIONS HAD OVERPOWERED HER INTEREST, AND SHE HAD SACRIFICED,
FOR THE YOUNG MAN'S SAKE, THE POSSIBILITY OF SCHEMING LONGER
FOR SIR WALTER.  SHE HAS ABILITIES, HOWEVER, AS WELL AS AFFECTIONS;
AND IT IS NOW A DOUBTFUL POINT WHETHER HIS CUNNING, OR HERS,
MAY FINALLY CARRY THE DAY; WHETHER, AFTER PREVENTING HER FROM BEING
THE WIFE OF SIR WALTER, HE MAY NOT BE WHEEDLED AND CARESSED AT LAST
INTO MAKING HER THE WIFE OF SIR WILLIAM.

IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE SHOCKED
AND MORTIFIED BY THE LOSS OF THEIR COMPANION, AND THE DISCOVERY OF
THEIR DECEPTION IN HER.  THEY HAD THEIR GREAT COUSINS, TO BE SURE,
TO RESORT TO FOR COMFORT; BUT THEY MUST LONG FEEL THAT TO FLATTER
AND FOLLOW OTHERS, WITHOUT BEING FLATTERED AND FOLLOWED IN TURN,
IS BUT A STATE OF HALF ENJOYMENT.

ANNE, SATISFIED AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD OF LADY RUSSELL'S MEANING
TO LOVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AS SHE OUGHT, HAD NO OTHER ALLOY
TO THE HAPPINESS OF HER PROSPECTS THAN WHAT AROSE FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS
OF HAVING NO RELATIONS TO BESTOW ON HIM WHICH A MAN OF SENSE COULD VALUE.
THERE SHE FELT HER OWN INFERIORITY VERY KEENLY.  THE DISPROPORTION
IN THEIR FORTUNE WAS NOTHING; IT DID NOT GIVE HER A MOMENT'S REGRET;
BUT TO HAVE NO FAMILY TO RECEIVE AND ESTIMATE HIM PROPERLY,
NOTHING OF RESPECTABILITY, OF HARMONY, OF GOOD WILL TO OFFER
IN RETURN FOR ALL THE WORTH AND ALL THE PROMPT WELCOME WHICH MET HER
IN HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WAS A SOURCE OF AS LIVELY PAIN
AS HER MIND COULD WELL BE SENSIBLE OF UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF OTHERWISE
STRONG FELICITY.  SHE HAD BUT TWO FRIENDS IN THE WORLD TO ADD TO HIS LIST,
LADY RUSSELL AND MRS SMITH.  TO THOSE, HOWEVER, HE WAS VERY WELL DISPOSED
TO ATTACH HIMSELF.  LADY RUSSELL, IN SPITE OF ALL HER FORMER TRANSGRESSIONS,
HE COULD NOW VALUE FROM HIS HEART.  WHILE HE WAS NOT OBLIGED TO SAY
THAT HE BELIEVED HER TO HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN ORIGINALLY DIVIDING THEM,
HE WAS READY TO SAY ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE IN HER FAVOUR,
AND AS FOR MRS SMITH, SHE HAD CLAIMS OF VARIOUS KINDS TO RECOMMEND HER
QUICKLY AND PERMANENTLY.

HER RECENT GOOD OFFICES BY ANNE HAD BEEN ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES,
AND THEIR MARRIAGE, INSTEAD OF DEPRIVING HER OF ONE FRIEND,
SECURED HER TWO.  SHE WAS THEIR EARLIEST VISITOR IN THEIR SETTLED LIFE;
AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, BY PUTTING HER IN THE WAY OF RECOVERING
HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY IN THE WEST INDIES, BY WRITING FOR HER,
ACTING FOR HER, AND SEEING HER THROUGH ALL THE PETTY DIFFICULTIES
OF THE CASE WITH THE ACTIVITY AND EXERTION OF A FEARLESS MAN
AND A DETERMINED FRIEND, FULLY REQUITED THE SERVICES WHICH
SHE HAD RENDERED, OR EVER MEANT TO RENDER, TO HIS WIFE.

MRS SMITH'S ENJOYMENTS WERE NOT SPOILED BY THIS IMPROVEMENT OF INCOME,
WITH SOME IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH, AND THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH FRIENDS
TO BE OFTEN WITH, FOR HER CHEERFULNESS AND MENTAL ALACRITY DID NOT
FAIL HER; AND WHILE THESE PRIME SUPPLIES OF GOOD REMAINED, SHE MIGHT HAVE
BID DEFIANCE EVEN TO GREATER ACCESSIONS OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY.
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY RICH AND PERFECTLY HEALTHY,
AND YET BE HAPPY.  HER SPRING OF FELICITY WAS IN THE GLOW
OF HER SPIRITS, AS HER FRIEND ANNE'S WAS IN THE WARMTH OF HER HEART.
ANNE WAS TENDERNESS ITSELF, AND SHE HAD THE FULL WORTH OF IT
IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S AFFECTION.  HIS PROFESSION WAS ALL THAT COULD EVER
MAKE HER FRIENDS WISH THAT TENDERNESS LESS, THE DREAD OF A FUTURE WAR
ALL THAT COULD DIM HER SUNSHINE.  SHE GLORIED IN BEING A SAILOR'S WIFE,
BUT SHE MUST PAY THE TAX OF QUICK ALARM FOR BELONGING TO THAT PROFESSION
WHICH IS, IF POSSIBLE, MORE DISTINGUISHED IN ITS DOMESTIC VIRTUES
THAN IN ITS NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.

[SENSE AND SENSIBILITY BY JANE AUSTEN 1811]

CHAPTER 1


THE FAMILY OF DASHWOOD HAD LONG BEEN SETTLED IN SUSSEX.
THEIR ESTATE WAS LARGE, AND THEIR RESIDENCE WAS AT NORLAND PARK,
IN THE CENTRE OF THEIR PROPERTY, WHERE, FOR MANY GENERATIONS,
THEY HAD LIVED IN SO RESPECTABLE A MANNER AS TO ENGAGE
THE GENERAL GOOD OPINION OF THEIR SURROUNDING ACQUAINTANCE.
THE LATE OWNER OF THIS ESTATE WAS A SINGLE MAN, WHO LIVED
TO A VERY ADVANCED AGE, AND WHO FOR MANY YEARS OF HIS LIFE,
HAD A CONSTANT COMPANION AND HOUSEKEEPER IN HIS SISTER.
BUT HER DEATH, WHICH HAPPENED TEN YEARS BEFORE HIS OWN,
PRODUCED A GREAT ALTERATION IN HIS HOME; FOR TO SUPPLY
HER LOSS, HE INVITED AND RECEIVED INTO HIS HOUSE THE FAMILY
OF HIS NEPHEW MR. HENRY DASHWOOD, THE LEGAL INHERITOR
OF THE NORLAND ESTATE, AND THE PERSON TO WHOM HE INTENDED
TO BEQUEATH IT.  IN THE SOCIETY OF HIS NEPHEW AND NIECE,
AND THEIR CHILDREN, THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S DAYS WERE
COMFORTABLY SPENT.  HIS ATTACHMENT TO THEM ALL INCREASED.
THE CONSTANT ATTENTION OF MR. AND MRS. HENRY DASHWOOD
TO HIS WISHES, WHICH PROCEEDED NOT MERELY FROM INTEREST,
BUT FROM GOODNESS OF HEART, GAVE HIM EVERY DEGREE OF SOLID
COMFORT WHICH HIS AGE COULD RECEIVE; AND THE CHEERFULNESS
OF THE CHILDREN ADDED A RELISH TO HIS EXISTENCE.

BY A FORMER MARRIAGE, MR. HENRY DASHWOOD HAD ONE
SON: BY HIS PRESENT LADY, THREE DAUGHTERS.  THE SON,
A STEADY RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN, WAS AMPLY PROVIDED
FOR BY THE FORTUNE OF HIS MOTHER, WHICH HAD BEEN LARGE,
AND HALF OF WHICH DEVOLVED ON HIM ON HIS COMING OF AGE.
BY HIS OWN MARRIAGE, LIKEWISE, WHICH HAPPENED SOON AFTERWARDS,
HE ADDED TO HIS WEALTH.  TO HIM THEREFORE THE SUCCESSION
TO THE NORLAND ESTATE WAS NOT SO REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO
HIS SISTERS; FOR THEIR FORTUNE, INDEPENDENT OF WHAT MIGHT
ARISE TO THEM FROM THEIR FATHER'S INHERITING THAT PROPERTY,
COULD BE BUT SMALL.  THEIR MOTHER HAD NOTHING, AND THEIR
FATHER ONLY SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS IN HIS OWN DISPOSAL;
FOR THE REMAINING MOIETY OF HIS FIRST WIFE'S FORTUNE WAS
ALSO SECURED TO HER CHILD, AND HE HAD ONLY A LIFE-INTEREST
IN IT.

THE OLD GENTLEMAN DIED: HIS WILL WAS READ, AND
LIKE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WILL, GAVE AS MUCH DISAPPOINTMENT
AS PLEASURE.  HE WAS NEITHER SO UNJUST, NOR SO UNGRATEFUL,
AS TO LEAVE HIS ESTATE FROM HIS NEPHEW;--BUT HE LEFT IT TO HIM
ON SUCH TERMS AS DESTROYED HALF THE VALUE OF THE BEQUEST.
MR. DASHWOOD HAD WISHED FOR IT MORE FOR THE SAKE OF HIS
WIFE AND DAUGHTERS THAN FOR HIMSELF OR HIS SON;--BUT TO
HIS SON, AND HIS SON'S SON, A CHILD OF FOUR YEARS OLD,
IT WAS SECURED, IN SUCH A WAY, AS TO LEAVE TO HIMSELF
NO POWER OF PROVIDING FOR THOSE WHO WERE MOST DEAR
TO HIM, AND WHO MOST NEEDED A PROVISION BY ANY CHARGE
ON THE ESTATE, OR BY ANY SALE OF ITS VALUABLE WOODS.
THE WHOLE WAS TIED UP FOR THE BENEFIT OF THIS CHILD, WHO,
IN OCCASIONAL VISITS WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AT NORLAND,
HAD SO FAR GAINED ON THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS UNCLE,
BY SUCH ATTRACTIONS AS ARE BY NO MEANS UNUSUAL IN CHILDREN
OF TWO OR THREE YEARS OLD; AN IMPERFECT ARTICULATION,
AN EARNEST DESIRE OF HAVING HIS OWN WAY, MANY CUNNING TRICKS,
AND A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE, AS TO OUTWEIGH ALL THE VALUE
OF ALL THE ATTENTION WHICH, FOR YEARS, HE HAD RECEIVED
FROM HIS NIECE AND HER DAUGHTERS.  HE MEANT NOT TO
BE UNKIND, HOWEVER, AND, AS A MARK OF HIS AFFECTION
FOR THE THREE GIRLS, HE LEFT THEM A THOUSAND POUNDS A-PIECE.

MR. DASHWOOD'S DISAPPOINTMENT WAS, AT FIRST, SEVERE;
BUT HIS TEMPER WAS CHEERFUL AND SANGUINE; AND HE MIGHT
REASONABLY HOPE TO LIVE MANY YEARS, AND BY LIVING ECONOMICALLY,
LAY BY A CONSIDERABLE SUM FROM THE PRODUCE OF AN ESTATE
ALREADY LARGE, AND CAPABLE OF ALMOST IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT.
BUT THE FORTUNE, WHICH HAD BEEN SO TARDY IN COMING, WAS HIS
ONLY ONE TWELVEMONTH.  HE SURVIVED HIS UNCLE NO LONGER;
AND TEN THOUSAND POUNDS, INCLUDING THE LATE LEGACIES,
WAS ALL THAT REMAINED FOR HIS WIDOW AND DAUGHTERS.

HIS SON WAS SENT FOR AS SOON AS HIS DANGER WAS KNOWN,
AND TO HIM MR. DASHWOOD RECOMMENDED, WITH ALL THE STRENGTH
AND URGENCY WHICH ILLNESS COULD COMMAND, THE INTEREST
OF HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW AND SISTERS.

MR. JOHN DASHWOOD HAD NOT THE STRONG FEELINGS OF THE
REST OF THE FAMILY; BUT HE WAS AFFECTED BY A RECOMMENDATION
OF SUCH A NATURE AT SUCH A TIME, AND HE PROMISED TO DO
EVERY THING IN HIS POWER TO MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE.
HIS FATHER WAS RENDERED EASY BY SUCH AN ASSURANCE,
AND MR. JOHN DASHWOOD HAD THEN LEISURE TO CONSIDER HOW
MUCH THERE MIGHT PRUDENTLY BE IN HIS POWER TO DO FOR THEM.

HE WAS NOT AN ILL-DISPOSED YOUNG MAN, UNLESS TO
BE RATHER COLD HEARTED AND RATHER SELFISH IS TO BE
ILL-DISPOSED: BUT HE WAS, IN GENERAL, WELL RESPECTED;
FOR HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF WITH PROPRIETY IN THE DISCHARGE
OF HIS ORDINARY DUTIES.  HAD HE MARRIED A MORE AMIABLE WOMAN,
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE STILL MORE RESPECTABLE THAN HE
WAS:--HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE BEEN MADE AMIABLE HIMSELF; FOR HE
WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN HE MARRIED, AND VERY FOND OF HIS WIFE.
BUT MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD WAS A STRONG CARICATURE OF HIMSELF;--
MORE NARROW-MINDED AND SELFISH.

WHEN HE GAVE HIS PROMISE TO HIS FATHER, HE MEDITATED
WITHIN HIMSELF TO INCREASE THE FORTUNES OF HIS SISTERS
BY THE PRESENT OF A THOUSAND POUNDS A-PIECE.  HE THEN
REALLY THOUGHT HIMSELF EQUAL TO IT.  THE PROSPECT OF FOUR
THOUSAND A-YEAR, IN ADDITION TO HIS PRESENT INCOME,
BESIDES THE REMAINING HALF OF HIS OWN MOTHER'S FORTUNE,
WARMED HIS HEART, AND MADE HIM FEEL CAPABLE OF GENEROSITY.--
"YES, HE WOULD GIVE THEM THREE THOUSAND POUNDS: IT WOULD
BE LIBERAL AND HANDSOME! IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE
THEM COMPLETELY EASY.  THREE THOUSAND POUNDS! HE COULD
SPARE SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM WITH LITTLE INCONVENIENCE."--
HE THOUGHT OF IT ALL DAY LONG, AND FOR MANY DAYS SUCCESSIVELY,
AND HE DID NOT REPENT.

NO SOONER WAS HIS FATHER'S FUNERAL OVER, THAN MRS. JOHN
DASHWOOD, WITHOUT SENDING ANY NOTICE OF HER INTENTION TO HER
MOTHER-IN-LAW, ARRIVED WITH HER CHILD AND THEIR ATTENDANTS.
NO ONE COULD DISPUTE HER RIGHT TO COME; THE HOUSE WAS
HER HUSBAND'S FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS FATHER'S DECEASE;
BUT THE INDELICACY OF HER CONDUCT WAS SO MUCH THE GREATER,
AND TO A WOMAN IN MRS. DASHWOOD'S SITUATION, WITH ONLY
COMMON FEELINGS, MUST HAVE BEEN HIGHLY UNPLEASING;--
BUT IN HER MIND THERE WAS A SENSE OF HONOR SO KEEN,
A GENEROSITY SO ROMANTIC, THAT ANY OFFENCE OF THE KIND,
BY WHOMSOEVER GIVEN OR RECEIVED, WAS TO HER A SOURCE
OF IMMOVEABLE DISGUST.  MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD HAD NEVER
BEEN A FAVOURITE WITH ANY OF HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY;
BUT SHE HAD HAD NO OPPORTUNITY, TILL THE PRESENT,
OF SHEWING THEM WITH HOW LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE COMFORT
OF OTHER PEOPLE SHE COULD ACT WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED IT.

SO ACUTELY DID MRS. DASHWOOD FEEL THIS UNGRACIOUS
BEHAVIOUR, AND SO EARNESTLY DID SHE DESPISE HER
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW FOR IT, THAT, ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE LATTER,
SHE WOULD HAVE QUITTED THE HOUSE FOR EVER, HAD NOT THE
ENTREATY OF HER ELDEST GIRL INDUCED HER FIRST TO REFLECT
ON THE PROPRIETY OF GOING, AND HER OWN TENDER LOVE FOR ALL
HER THREE CHILDREN DETERMINED HER AFTERWARDS TO STAY,
AND FOR THEIR SAKES AVOID A BREACH WITH THEIR BROTHER.

ELINOR, THIS ELDEST DAUGHTER, WHOSE ADVICE WAS
SO EFFECTUAL, POSSESSED A STRENGTH OF UNDERSTANDING,
AND COOLNESS OF JUDGMENT, WHICH QUALIFIED HER,
THOUGH ONLY NINETEEN, TO BE THE COUNSELLOR OF HER MOTHER,
AND ENABLED HER FREQUENTLY TO COUNTERACT, TO THE ADVANTAGE
OF THEM ALL, THAT EAGERNESS OF MIND IN MRS. DASHWOOD
WHICH MUST GENERALLY HAVE LED TO IMPRUDENCE.  SHE HAD
AN EXCELLENT HEART;--HER DISPOSITION WAS AFFECTIONATE,
AND HER FEELINGS WERE STRONG; BUT SHE KNEW HOW TO GOVERN
THEM: IT WAS A KNOWLEDGE WHICH HER MOTHER HAD YET TO LEARN;
AND WHICH ONE OF HER SISTERS HAD RESOLVED NEVER TO BE TAUGHT.

MARIANNE'S ABILITIES WERE, IN MANY RESPECTS,
QUITE EQUAL TO ELINOR'S. SHE WAS SENSIBLE AND CLEVER;
BUT EAGER IN EVERYTHING: HER SORROWS, HER JOYS, COULD HAVE
NO MODERATION.  SHE WAS GENEROUS, AMIABLE, INTERESTING: SHE
WAS EVERYTHING BUT PRUDENT.  THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN
HER AND HER MOTHER WAS STRIKINGLY GREAT.

ELINOR SAW, WITH CONCERN, THE EXCESS OF HER
SISTER'S SENSIBILITY; BUT BY MRS. DASHWOOD IT WAS VALUED
AND CHERISHED.  THEY ENCOURAGED EACH OTHER NOW IN THE
VIOLENCE OF THEIR AFFLICTION.  THE AGONY OF GRIEF
WHICH OVERPOWERED THEM AT FIRST, WAS VOLUNTARILY RENEWED,
WAS SOUGHT FOR, WAS CREATED AGAIN AND AGAIN.  THEY GAVE
THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO THEIR SORROW, SEEKING INCREASE
OF WRETCHEDNESS IN EVERY REFLECTION THAT COULD AFFORD IT,
AND RESOLVED AGAINST EVER ADMITTING CONSOLATION
IN FUTURE.  ELINOR, TOO, WAS DEEPLY AFFLICTED; BUT STILL
SHE COULD STRUGGLE, SHE COULD EXERT HERSELF.  SHE COULD
CONSULT WITH HER BROTHER, COULD RECEIVE HER SISTER-IN-LAW
ON HER ARRIVAL, AND TREAT HER WITH PROPER ATTENTION;
AND COULD STRIVE TO ROUSE HER MOTHER TO SIMILAR EXERTION,
AND ENCOURAGE HER TO SIMILAR FORBEARANCE.

MARGARET, THE OTHER SISTER, WAS A GOOD-HUMORED,
WELL-DISPOSED GIRL; BUT AS SHE HAD ALREADY IMBIBED
A GOOD DEAL OF MARIANNE'S ROMANCE, WITHOUT HAVING
MUCH OF HER SENSE, SHE DID NOT, AT THIRTEEN, BID FAIR
TO EQUAL HER SISTERS AT A MORE ADVANCED PERIOD OF LIFE.



CHAPTER 2


MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD NOW INSTALLED HERSELF MISTRESS
OF NORLAND; AND HER MOTHER AND SISTERS-IN-LAW WERE DEGRADED
TO THE CONDITION OF VISITORS.  AS SUCH, HOWEVER, THEY WERE
TREATED BY HER WITH QUIET CIVILITY; AND BY HER HUSBAND
WITH AS MUCH KINDNESS AS HE COULD FEEL TOWARDS ANYBODY
BEYOND HIMSELF, HIS WIFE, AND THEIR CHILD.  HE REALLY
PRESSED THEM, WITH SOME EARNESTNESS, TO CONSIDER NORLAND
AS THEIR HOME; AND, AS NO PLAN APPEARED SO ELIGIBLE
TO MRS. DASHWOOD AS REMAINING THERE TILL SHE COULD
ACCOMMODATE HERSELF WITH A HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD,
HIS INVITATION WAS ACCEPTED.

A CONTINUANCE IN A PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING REMINDED
HER OF FORMER DELIGHT, WAS EXACTLY WHAT SUITED HER MIND.
IN SEASONS OF CHEERFULNESS, NO TEMPER COULD BE MORE CHEERFUL
THAN HERS, OR POSSESS, IN A GREATER DEGREE, THAT SANGUINE
EXPECTATION OF HAPPINESS WHICH IS HAPPINESS ITSELF.
BUT IN SORROW SHE MUST BE EQUALLY CARRIED AWAY BY HER FANCY,
AND AS FAR BEYOND CONSOLATION AS IN PLEASURE SHE WAS
BEYOND ALLOY.

MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD DID NOT AT ALL APPROVE OF WHAT HER
HUSBAND INTENDED TO DO FOR HIS SISTERS.  TO TAKE THREE
THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE FORTUNE OF THEIR DEAR LITTLE BOY
WOULD BE IMPOVERISHING HIM TO THE MOST DREADFUL DEGREE.
SHE BEGGED HIM TO THINK AGAIN ON THE SUBJECT.  HOW COULD
HE ANSWER IT TO HIMSELF TO ROB HIS CHILD, AND HIS ONLY
CHILD TOO, OF SO LARGE A SUM?  AND WHAT POSSIBLE CLAIM
COULD THE MISS DASHWOODS, WHO WERE RELATED TO HIM ONLY BY
HALF BLOOD, WHICH SHE CONSIDERED AS NO RELATIONSHIP AT ALL,
HAVE ON HIS GENEROSITY TO SO LARGE AN AMOUNT.  IT WAS VERY
WELL KNOWN THAT NO AFFECTION WAS EVER SUPPOSED TO EXIST
BETWEEN THE CHILDREN OF ANY MAN BY DIFFERENT MARRIAGES;
AND WHY WAS HE TO RUIN HIMSELF, AND THEIR POOR LITTLE HARRY,
BY GIVING AWAY ALL HIS MONEY TO HIS HALF SISTERS?

"IT WAS MY FATHER'S LAST REQUEST TO ME," REPLIED
HER HUSBAND, "THAT I SHOULD ASSIST HIS WIDOW AND DAUGHTERS."

"HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING OF, I DARE SAY;
TEN TO ONE BUT HE WAS LIGHT-HEADED AT THE TIME.
HAD HE BEEN IN HIS RIGHT SENSES, HE COULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT
OF SUCH A THING AS BEGGING YOU TO GIVE AWAY HALF YOUR
FORTUNE FROM YOUR OWN CHILD."

"HE DID NOT STIPULATE FOR ANY PARTICULAR SUM,
MY DEAR FANNY; HE ONLY REQUESTED ME, IN GENERAL TERMS,
TO ASSIST THEM, AND MAKE THEIR SITUATION MORE COMFORTABLE
THAN IT WAS IN HIS POWER TO DO.  PERHAPS IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN AS WELL IF HE HAD LEFT IT WHOLLY TO MYSELF.
HE COULD HARDLY SUPPOSE I SHOULD NEGLECT THEM.
BUT AS HE REQUIRED THE PROMISE, I COULD NOT DO LESS
THAN GIVE IT; AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO AT THE TIME.
THE PROMISE, THEREFORE, WAS GIVEN, AND MUST BE PERFORMED.
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE FOR THEM WHENEVER THEY LEAVE NORLAND
AND SETTLE IN A NEW HOME."

"WELL, THEN, LET SOMETHING BE DONE FOR THEM;
BUT THAT SOMETHING NEED NOT BE THREE THOUSAND POUNDS.
CONSIDER," SHE ADDED, "THAT WHEN THE MONEY IS ONCE
PARTED WITH, IT NEVER CAN RETURN.  YOUR SISTERS WILL MARRY,
AND IT WILL BE GONE FOR EVER.  IF, INDEED, IT COULD
BE RESTORED TO OUR POOR LITTLE BOY--"

"WHY, TO BE SURE," SAID HER HUSBAND, VERY GRAVELY,
"THAT WOULD MAKE GREAT DIFFERENCE.  THE TIME MAY COME WHEN
HARRY WILL REGRET THAT SO LARGE A SUM WAS PARTED WITH.
IF HE SHOULD HAVE A NUMEROUS FAMILY, FOR INSTANCE, IT WOULD
BE A VERY CONVENIENT ADDITION."

"TO BE SURE IT WOULD."

"PERHAPS, THEN, IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ALL PARTIES,
IF THE SUM WERE DIMINISHED ONE HALF.--FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
WOULD BE A PRODIGIOUS INCREASE TO THEIR FORTUNES!"

"OH! BEYOND ANYTHING GREAT!  WHAT BROTHER ON EARTH
WOULD DO HALF SO MUCH FOR HIS SISTERS, EVEN IF REALLY
HIS SISTERS!  AND AS IT IS--ONLY HALF BLOOD!--BUT YOU
HAVE SUCH A GENEROUS SPIRIT!"

"I WOULD NOT WISH TO DO ANY THING MEAN," HE REPLIED.
"ONE HAD RATHER, ON SUCH OCCASIONS, DO TOO MUCH THAN
TOO LITTLE.  NO ONE, AT LEAST, CAN THINK I HAVE NOT
DONE ENOUGH FOR THEM: EVEN THEMSELVES, THEY CAN HARDLY
EXPECT MORE."

"THERE IS NO KNOWING WHAT THEY MAY EXPECT,"
SAID THE LADY, "BUT WE ARE NOT TO THINK OF THEIR
EXPECTATIONS: THE QUESTION IS, WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO DO."

"CERTAINLY--AND I THINK I MAY AFFORD TO GIVE THEM FIVE
HUNDRED POUNDS A-PIECE.  AS IT IS, WITHOUT ANY ADDITION
OF MINE, THEY WILL EACH HAVE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND POUNDS
ON THEIR MOTHER'S DEATH--A VERY COMFORTABLE FORTUNE
FOR ANY YOUNG WOMAN."

"TO BE SURE IT IS; AND, INDEED, IT STRIKES ME THAT
THEY CAN WANT NO ADDITION AT ALL.  THEY WILL HAVE TEN
THOUSAND POUNDS DIVIDED AMONGST THEM.  IF THEY MARRY,
THEY WILL BE SURE OF DOING WELL, AND IF THEY DO NOT,
THEY MAY ALL LIVE VERY COMFORTABLY TOGETHER ON THE INTEREST
OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS."

"THAT IS VERY TRUE, AND, THEREFORE, I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER,
UPON THE WHOLE, IT WOULD NOT BE MORE ADVISABLE TO DO
SOMETHING FOR THEIR MOTHER WHILE SHE LIVES, RATHER THAN
FOR THEM--SOMETHING OF THE ANNUITY KIND I MEAN.--MY SISTERS
WOULD FEEL THE GOOD EFFECTS OF IT AS WELL AS HERSELF.
A HUNDRED A YEAR WOULD MAKE THEM ALL PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE."

HIS WIFE HESITATED A LITTLE, HOWEVER, IN GIVING
HER CONSENT TO THIS PLAN.

"TO BE SURE," SAID SHE, "IT IS BETTER THAN PARTING WITH
FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS AT ONCE.  BUT, THEN, IF MRS. DASHWOOD
SHOULD LIVE FIFTEEN YEARS WE SHALL BE COMPLETELY TAKEN IN."

"FIFTEEN YEARS! MY DEAR FANNY; HER LIFE CANNOT
BE WORTH HALF THAT PURCHASE."

"CERTAINLY NOT; BUT IF YOU OBSERVE, PEOPLE ALWAYS
LIVE FOR EVER WHEN THERE IS AN ANNUITY TO BE PAID THEM;
AND SHE IS VERY STOUT AND HEALTHY, AND HARDLY FORTY.
AN ANNUITY IS A VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS; IT COMES OVER
AND OVER EVERY YEAR, AND THERE IS NO GETTING RID
OF IT.  YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
I HAVE KNOWN A GREAT DEAL OF THE TROUBLE OF ANNUITIES;
FOR MY MOTHER WAS CLOGGED WITH THE PAYMENT OF THREE
TO OLD SUPERANNUATED SERVANTS BY MY FATHER'S WILL,
AND IT IS AMAZING HOW DISAGREEABLE SHE FOUND IT.
TWICE EVERY YEAR THESE ANNUITIES WERE TO BE PAID; AND THEN
THERE WAS THE TROUBLE OF GETTING IT TO THEM; AND THEN ONE
OF THEM WAS SAID TO HAVE DIED, AND AFTERWARDS IT TURNED
OUT TO BE NO SUCH THING.  MY MOTHER WAS QUITE SICK OF IT.
HER INCOME WAS NOT HER OWN, SHE SAID, WITH SUCH PERPETUAL
CLAIMS ON IT; AND IT WAS THE MORE UNKIND IN MY FATHER,
BECAUSE, OTHERWISE, THE MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY AT
MY MOTHER'S DISPOSAL, WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION WHATEVER.
IT HAS GIVEN ME SUCH AN ABHORRENCE OF ANNUITIES, THAT I AM
SURE I WOULD NOT PIN MYSELF DOWN TO THE PAYMENT OF ONE FOR
ALL THE WORLD."

"IT IS CERTAINLY AN UNPLEASANT THING," REPLIED MR. DASHWOOD,
"TO HAVE THOSE KIND OF YEARLY DRAINS ON ONE'S INCOME.
ONE'S FORTUNE, AS YOUR MOTHER JUSTLY SAYS, IS NOT ONE'S OWN.
TO BE TIED DOWN TO THE REGULAR PAYMENT OF SUCH A SUM,
ON EVERY RENT DAY, IS BY NO MEANS DESIRABLE: IT TAKES AWAY
ONE'S INDEPENDENCE."

"UNDOUBTEDLY; AND AFTER ALL YOU HAVE NO THANKS FOR IT.
THEY THINK THEMSELVES SECURE, YOU DO NO MORE THAN WHAT
IS EXPECTED, AND IT RAISES NO GRATITUDE AT ALL.  IF I WERE YOU,
WHATEVER I DID SHOULD BE DONE AT MY OWN DISCRETION ENTIRELY.
I WOULD NOT BIND MYSELF TO ALLOW THEM ANY THING YEARLY.
IT MAY BE VERY INCONVENIENT SOME YEARS TO SPARE A HUNDRED,
OR EVEN FIFTY POUNDS FROM OUR OWN EXPENSES."

"I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT, MY LOVE; IT WILL BE BETTER
THAT THERE SHOULD BY NO ANNUITY IN THE CASE; WHATEVER I
MAY GIVE THEM OCCASIONALLY WILL BE OF FAR GREATER ASSISTANCE
THAN A YEARLY ALLOWANCE, BECAUSE THEY WOULD ONLY ENLARGE
THEIR STYLE OF LIVING IF THEY FELT SURE OF A LARGER INCOME,
AND WOULD NOT BE SIXPENCE THE RICHER FOR IT AT THE END
OF THE YEAR.  IT WILL CERTAINLY BE MUCH THE BEST WAY.
A PRESENT OF FIFTY POUNDS, NOW AND THEN, WILL PREVENT
THEIR EVER BEING DISTRESSED FOR MONEY, AND WILL, I THINK,
BE AMPLY DISCHARGING MY PROMISE TO MY FATHER."

"TO BE SURE IT WILL.  INDEED, TO SAY THE TRUTH,
I AM CONVINCED WITHIN MYSELF THAT YOUR FATHER HAD NO IDEA
OF YOUR GIVING THEM ANY MONEY AT ALL.  THE ASSISTANCE
HE THOUGHT OF, I DARE SAY, WAS ONLY SUCH AS MIGHT BE
REASONABLY EXPECTED OF YOU; FOR INSTANCE, SUCH AS LOOKING
OUT FOR A COMFORTABLE SMALL HOUSE FOR THEM, HELPING THEM
TO MOVE THEIR THINGS, AND SENDING THEM PRESENTS OF FISH
AND GAME, AND SO FORTH, WHENEVER THEY ARE IN SEASON.
I'LL LAY MY LIFE THAT HE MEANT NOTHING FARTHER; INDEED,
IT WOULD BE VERY STRANGE AND UNREASONABLE IF HE DID.
DO BUT CONSIDER, MY DEAR MR. DASHWOOD, HOW EXCESSIVELY
COMFORTABLE YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW AND HER DAUGHTERS MAY LIVE
ON THE INTEREST OF SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS, BESIDES THE
THOUSAND POUNDS BELONGING TO EACH OF THE GIRLS, WHICH BRINGS
THEM IN FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR A-PIECE, AND, OF COURSE,
THEY WILL PAY THEIR MOTHER FOR THEIR BOARD OUT OF IT.
ALTOGETHER, THEY WILL HAVE FIVE HUNDRED A-YEAR AMONGST THEM,
AND WHAT ON EARTH CAN FOUR WOMEN WANT FOR MORE THAN
THAT?--THEY WILL LIVE SO CHEAP! THEIR HOUSEKEEPING WILL
BE NOTHING AT ALL.  THEY WILL HAVE NO CARRIAGE, NO HORSES,
AND HARDLY ANY SERVANTS; THEY WILL KEEP NO COMPANY,
AND CAN HAVE NO EXPENSES OF ANY KIND!  ONLY CONCEIVE
HOW COMFORTABLE THEY WILL BE!  FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR! I AM
SURE I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW THEY WILL SPEND HALF OF IT;
AND AS TO YOUR GIVING THEM MORE, IT IS QUITE ABSURD TO THINK
OF IT.  THEY WILL BE MUCH MORE ABLE TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING."

"UPON MY WORD," SAID MR. DASHWOOD, "I BELIEVE YOU
ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT.  MY FATHER CERTAINLY COULD MEAN
NOTHING MORE BY HIS REQUEST TO ME THAN WHAT YOU SAY.
I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND IT NOW, AND I WILL STRICTLY FULFIL
MY ENGAGEMENT BY SUCH ACTS OF ASSISTANCE AND KINDNESS
TO THEM AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED.  WHEN MY MOTHER REMOVES
INTO ANOTHER HOUSE MY SERVICES SHALL BE READILY GIVEN
TO ACCOMMODATE HER AS FAR AS I CAN.  SOME LITTLE PRESENT
OF FURNITURE TOO MAY BE ACCEPTABLE THEN."

"CERTAINLY," RETURNED MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD.  "BUT, HOWEVER,
ONE THING MUST BE CONSIDERED.  WHEN YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER
MOVED TO NORLAND, THOUGH THE FURNITURE OF STANHILL
WAS SOLD, ALL THE CHINA, PLATE, AND LINEN WAS SAVED,
AND IS NOW LEFT TO YOUR MOTHER.  HER HOUSE WILL THEREFORE
BE ALMOST COMPLETELY FITTED UP AS SOON AS SHE TAKES IT."

"THAT IS A MATERIAL CONSIDERATION UNDOUBTEDLY.
A VALUABLE LEGACY INDEED! AND YET SOME OF THE PLATE WOULD
HAVE BEEN A VERY PLEASANT ADDITION TO OUR OWN STOCK HERE."

"YES; AND THE SET OF BREAKFAST CHINA IS TWICE
AS HANDSOME AS WHAT BELONGS TO THIS HOUSE.  A GREAT
DEAL TOO HANDSOME, IN MY OPINION, FOR ANY PLACE THEY
CAN EVER AFFORD TO LIVE IN.  BUT, HOWEVER, SO IT IS.
YOUR FATHER THOUGHT ONLY OF THEM.  AND I MUST SAY THIS:
THAT YOU OWE NO PARTICULAR GRATITUDE TO HIM, NOR ATTENTION
TO HIS WISHES; FOR WE VERY WELL KNOW THAT IF HE COULD,
HE WOULD HAVE LEFT ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO THEM."

THIS ARGUMENT WAS IRRESISTIBLE.  IT GAVE TO HIS
INTENTIONS WHATEVER OF DECISION WAS WANTING BEFORE; AND HE
FINALLY RESOLVED, THAT IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY,
IF NOT HIGHLY INDECOROUS, TO DO MORE FOR THE WIDOW
AND CHILDREN OF HIS FATHER, THAN SUCH KIND OF NEIGHBOURLY
ACTS AS HIS OWN WIFE POINTED OUT.



CHAPTER 3


MRS. DASHWOOD REMAINED AT NORLAND SEVERAL MONTHS;
NOT FROM ANY DISINCLINATION TO MOVE WHEN THE SIGHT OF EVERY
WELL KNOWN SPOT CEASED TO RAISE THE VIOLENT EMOTION WHICH IT
PRODUCED FOR A WHILE; FOR WHEN HER SPIRITS BEGAN TO REVIVE,
AND HER MIND BECAME CAPABLE OF SOME OTHER EXERTION THAN THAT
OF HEIGHTENING ITS AFFLICTION BY MELANCHOLY REMEMBRANCES,
SHE WAS IMPATIENT TO BE GONE, AND INDEFATIGABLE IN HER INQUIRIES
FOR A SUITABLE DWELLING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF NORLAND;
FOR TO REMOVE FAR FROM THAT BELOVED SPOT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
BUT SHE COULD HEAR OF NO SITUATION THAT AT ONCE ANSWERED
HER NOTIONS OF COMFORT AND EASE, AND SUITED THE PRUDENCE
OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER, WHOSE STEADIER JUDGMENT REJECTED
SEVERAL HOUSES AS TOO LARGE FOR THEIR INCOME, WHICH HER
MOTHER WOULD HAVE APPROVED.

MRS. DASHWOOD HAD BEEN INFORMED BY HER HUSBAND OF THE
SOLEMN PROMISE ON THE PART OF HIS SON IN THEIR FAVOUR,
WHICH GAVE COMFORT TO HIS LAST EARTHLY REFLECTIONS.
SHE DOUBTED THE SINCERITY OF THIS ASSURANCE NO MORE THAN HE
HAD DOUBTED IT HIMSELF, AND SHE THOUGHT OF IT FOR HER DAUGHTERS'
SAKE WITH SATISFACTION, THOUGH AS FOR HERSELF SHE WAS
PERSUADED THAT A MUCH SMALLER PROVISION THAN 7000L WOULD
SUPPORT HER IN AFFLUENCE.  FOR THEIR BROTHER'S SAKE, TOO,
FOR THE SAKE OF HIS OWN HEART, SHE REJOICED; AND SHE
REPROACHED HERSELF FOR BEING UNJUST TO HIS MERIT BEFORE,
IN BELIEVING HIM INCAPABLE OF GENEROSITY.  HIS ATTENTIVE
BEHAVIOUR TO HERSELF AND HIS SISTERS CONVINCED HER THAT
THEIR WELFARE WAS DEAR TO HIM, AND, FOR A LONG TIME,
SHE FIRMLY RELIED ON THE LIBERALITY OF HIS INTENTIONS.

THE CONTEMPT WHICH SHE HAD, VERY EARLY IN THEIR ACQUAINTANCE,
FELT FOR HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW, WAS VERY MUCH INCREASED
BY THE FARTHER KNOWLEDGE OF HER CHARACTER, WHICH HALF
A YEAR'S RESIDENCE IN HER FAMILY AFFORDED; AND PERHAPS
IN SPITE OF EVERY CONSIDERATION OF POLITENESS OR MATERNAL
AFFECTION ON THE SIDE OF THE FORMER, THE TWO LADIES MIGHT
HAVE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE LIVED TOGETHER SO LONG,
HAD NOT A PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED TO GIVE
STILL GREATER ELIGIBILITY, ACCORDING TO THE OPINIONS
OF MRS. DASHWOOD, TO HER DAUGHTERS' CONTINUANCE AT NORLAND.

THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS A GROWING ATTACHMENT BETWEEN
HER ELDEST GIRL AND THE BROTHER OF MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD,
A GENTLEMAN-LIKE AND PLEASING YOUNG MAN, WHO WAS INTRODUCED
TO THEIR ACQUAINTANCE SOON AFTER HIS SISTER'S ESTABLISHMENT
AT NORLAND, AND WHO HAD SINCE SPENT THE GREATEST PART
OF HIS TIME THERE.

SOME MOTHERS MIGHT HAVE ENCOURAGED THE INTIMACY FROM
MOTIVES OF INTEREST, FOR EDWARD FERRARS WAS THE ELDEST SON
OF A MAN WHO HAD DIED VERY RICH; AND SOME MIGHT HAVE REPRESSED
IT FROM MOTIVES OF PRUDENCE, FOR, EXCEPT A TRIFLING SUM,
THE WHOLE OF HIS FORTUNE DEPENDED ON THE WILL OF HIS MOTHER.
BUT MRS. DASHWOOD WAS ALIKE UNINFLUENCED BY EITHER CONSIDERATION.
IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HER THAT HE APPEARED TO BE AMIABLE,
THAT HE LOVED HER DAUGHTER, AND THAT ELINOR RETURNED
THE PARTIALITY.  IT WAS CONTRARY TO EVERY DOCTRINE OF
HER'S THAT DIFFERENCE OF FORTUNE SHOULD KEEP ANY COUPLE
ASUNDER WHO WERE ATTRACTED BY RESEMBLANCE OF DISPOSITION;
AND THAT ELINOR'S MERIT SHOULD NOT BE ACKNOWLEDGED
BY EVERY ONE WHO KNEW HER, WAS TO HER COMPREHENSION IMPOSSIBLE.

EDWARD FERRARS WAS NOT RECOMMENDED TO THEIR GOOD
OPINION BY ANY PECULIAR GRACES OF PERSON OR ADDRESS.
HE WAS NOT HANDSOME, AND HIS MANNERS REQUIRED INTIMACY
TO MAKE THEM PLEASING.  HE WAS TOO DIFFIDENT TO DO JUSTICE
TO HIMSELF; BUT WHEN HIS NATURAL SHYNESS WAS OVERCOME,
HIS BEHAVIOUR GAVE EVERY INDICATION OF AN OPEN,
AFFECTIONATE HEART.  HIS UNDERSTANDING WAS GOOD,
AND HIS EDUCATION HAD GIVEN IT SOLID IMPROVEMENT.
BUT HE WAS NEITHER FITTED BY ABILITIES NOR DISPOSITION
TO ANSWER THE WISHES OF HIS MOTHER AND SISTER, WHO LONGED
TO SEE HIM DISTINGUISHED--AS--THEY HARDLY KNEW WHAT.
THEY WANTED HIM TO MAKE A FINE FIGURE IN THE WORLD IN SOME
MANNER OR OTHER.  HIS MOTHER WISHED TO INTEREST HIM IN
POLITICAL CONCERNS, TO GET HIM INTO PARLIAMENT, OR TO SEE
HIM CONNECTED WITH SOME OF THE GREAT MEN OF THE DAY.
MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD WISHED IT LIKEWISE; BUT IN THE MEAN WHILE,
TILL ONE OF THESE SUPERIOR BLESSINGS COULD BE ATTAINED, IT WOULD
HAVE QUIETED HER AMBITION TO SEE HIM DRIVING A BAROUCHE.
BUT EDWARD HAD NO TURN FOR GREAT MEN OR BAROUCHES.
ALL HIS WISHES CENTERED IN DOMESTIC COMFORT AND THE QUIET
OF PRIVATE LIFE.  FORTUNATELY HE HAD A YOUNGER BROTHER
WHO WAS MORE PROMISING.

EDWARD HAD BEEN STAYING SEVERAL WEEKS IN THE HOUSE
BEFORE HE ENGAGED MUCH OF MRS. DASHWOOD'S ATTENTION;
FOR SHE WAS, AT THAT TIME, IN SUCH AFFLICTION AS RENDERED
HER CARELESS OF SURROUNDING OBJECTS.  SHE SAW ONLY THAT HE
WAS QUIET AND UNOBTRUSIVE, AND SHE LIKED HIM FOR IT.
HE DID NOT DISTURB THE WRETCHEDNESS OF HER MIND BY
ILL-TIMED CONVERSATION.  SHE WAS FIRST CALLED TO OBSERVE
AND APPROVE HIM FARTHER, BY A REFLECTION WHICH ELINOR
CHANCED ONE DAY TO MAKE ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM
AND HIS SISTER.  IT WAS A CONTRAST WHICH RECOMMENDED HIM
MOST FORCIBLY TO HER MOTHER.

"IT IS ENOUGH," SAID SHE; "TO SAY THAT HE IS UNLIKE
FANNY IS ENOUGH.  IT IMPLIES EVERYTHING AMIABLE.
I LOVE HIM ALREADY."

"I THINK YOU WILL LIKE HIM," SAID ELINOR, "WHEN YOU
KNOW MORE OF HIM."

"LIKE HIM!" REPLIED HER MOTHER WITH A SMILE.
"I FEEL NO SENTIMENT OF APPROBATION INFERIOR TO LOVE."

"YOU MAY ESTEEM HIM."

"I HAVE NEVER YET KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO SEPARATE
ESTEEM AND LOVE."

MRS. DASHWOOD NOW TOOK PAINS TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH HIM.
HER MANNERS WERE ATTACHING, AND SOON BANISHED HIS RESERVE.
SHE SPEEDILY COMPREHENDED ALL HIS MERITS; THE PERSUASION
OF HIS REGARD FOR ELINOR PERHAPS ASSISTED HER PENETRATION;
BUT SHE REALLY FELT ASSURED OF HIS WORTH: AND EVEN THAT
QUIETNESS OF MANNER, WHICH MILITATED AGAINST ALL HER
ESTABLISHED IDEAS OF WHAT A YOUNG MAN'S ADDRESS OUGHT TO BE,
WAS NO LONGER UNINTERESTING WHEN SHE KNEW HIS HEART TO BE
WARM AND HIS TEMPER AFFECTIONATE.

NO SOONER DID SHE PERCEIVE ANY SYMPTOM OF LOVE
IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ELINOR, THAN SHE CONSIDERED THEIR
SERIOUS ATTACHMENT AS CERTAIN, AND LOOKED FORWARD
TO THEIR MARRIAGE AS RAPIDLY APPROACHING.

"IN A FEW MONTHS, MY DEAR MARIANNE." SAID SHE,
"ELINOR WILL, IN ALL PROBABILITY BE SETTLED FOR LIFE.
WE SHALL MISS HER; BUT SHE WILL BE HAPPY."

"OH! MAMMA, HOW SHALL WE DO WITHOUT HER?"

"MY LOVE, IT WILL BE SCARCELY A SEPARATION.
WE SHALL LIVE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF EACH OTHER, AND SHALL
MEET EVERY DAY OF OUR LIVES.  YOU WILL GAIN A BROTHER,
A REAL, AFFECTIONATE BROTHER.  I HAVE THE HIGHEST OPINION
IN THE WORLD OF EDWARD'S HEART.  BUT YOU LOOK GRAVE,
MARIANNE; DO YOU DISAPPROVE YOUR SISTER'S CHOICE?"

"PERHAPS," SAID MARIANNE, "I MAY CONSIDER IT
WITH SOME SURPRISE.  EDWARD IS VERY AMIABLE, AND I LOVE
HIM TENDERLY.  BUT YET--HE IS NOT THE KIND OF YOUNG
MAN--THERE IS SOMETHING WANTING--HIS FIGURE IS NOT STRIKING;
IT HAS NONE OF THAT GRACE WHICH I SHOULD EXPECT
IN THE MAN WHO COULD SERIOUSLY ATTACH MY SISTER.
HIS EYES WANT ALL THAT SPIRIT, THAT FIRE, WHICH AT ONCE
ANNOUNCE VIRTUE AND INTELLIGENCE.  AND BESIDES ALL THIS,
I AM AFRAID, MAMMA, HE HAS NO REAL TASTE.  MUSIC SEEMS
SCARCELY TO ATTRACT HIM, AND THOUGH HE ADMIRES ELINOR'S
DRAWINGS VERY MUCH, IT IS NOT THE ADMIRATION OF A PERSON
WHO CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR WORTH.  IT IS EVIDENT, IN SPITE OF
HIS FREQUENT ATTENTION TO HER WHILE SHE DRAWS, THAT IN FACT
HE KNOWS NOTHING OF THE MATTER.  HE ADMIRES AS A LOVER,
NOT AS A CONNOISSEUR.  TO SATISFY ME, THOSE CHARACTERS
MUST BE UNITED.  I COULD NOT BE HAPPY WITH A MAN WHOSE
TASTE DID NOT IN EVERY POINT COINCIDE WITH MY OWN.
HE MUST ENTER INTO ALL MY FEELINGS; THE SAME BOOKS,
THE SAME MUSIC MUST CHARM US BOTH.  OH! MAMA, HOW SPIRITLESS,
HOW TAME WAS EDWARD'S MANNER IN READING TO US LAST NIGHT!
I FELT FOR MY SISTER MOST SEVERELY.  YET SHE BORE IT
WITH SO MUCH COMPOSURE, SHE SEEMED SCARCELY TO NOTICE IT.
I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY SEAT.  TO HEAR THOSE BEAUTIFUL LINES
WHICH HAVE FREQUENTLY ALMOST DRIVEN ME WILD, PRONOUNCED
WITH SUCH IMPENETRABLE CALMNESS, SUCH DREADFUL INDIFFERENCE!"--

"HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DONE MORE JUSTICE TO
SIMPLE AND ELEGANT PROSE.  I THOUGHT SO AT THE TIME;
BUT YOU WOULD GIVE HIM COWPER."

"NAY, MAMMA, IF HE IS NOT TO BE ANIMATED BY COWPER!--
BUT WE MUST ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCE OF TASTE.  ELINOR HAS
NOT MY FEELINGS, AND THEREFORE SHE MAY OVERLOOK IT, AND
BE HAPPY WITH HIM.  BUT IT WOULD HAVE BROKE MY HEART,
HAD I LOVED HIM, TO HEAR HIM READ WITH SO LITTLE SENSIBILITY.
MAMA, THE MORE I KNOW OF THE WORLD, THE MORE AM I CONVINCED
THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE A MAN WHOM I CAN REALLY LOVE.
I REQUIRE SO MUCH!  HE MUST HAVE ALL EDWARD'S VIRTUES,
AND HIS PERSON AND MANNERS MUST ORNAMENT HIS GOODNESS
WITH EVERY POSSIBLE CHARM."

"REMEMBER, MY LOVE, THAT YOU ARE NOT SEVENTEEN.
IT IS YET TOO EARLY IN LIFE TO DESPAIR OF SUCH A HAPPINESS.
WHY SHOULD YOU BE LESS FORTUNATE THAN YOUR MOTHER?  IN
ONE CIRCUMSTANCE ONLY, MY MARIANNE, MAY YOUR DESTINY BE
DIFFERENT FROM HER'S!"



CHAPTER 4


"WHAT A PITY IT IS, ELINOR," SAID MARIANNE,
"THAT EDWARD SHOULD HAVE NO TASTE FOR DRAWING."

"NO TASTE FOR DRAWING!" REPLIED ELINOR, "WHY SHOULD
YOU THINK SO? HE DOES NOT DRAW HIMSELF, INDEED, BUT HE HAS
GREAT PLEASURE IN SEEING THE PERFORMANCES OF OTHER PEOPLE,
AND I ASSURE YOU HE IS BY NO MEANS DEFICIENT IN NATURAL TASTE,
THOUGH HE HAS NOT HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF IMPROVING IT.
HAD HE EVER BEEN IN THE WAY OF LEARNING, I THINK HE WOULD
HAVE DRAWN VERY WELL.  HE DISTRUSTS HIS OWN JUDGMENT
IN SUCH MATTERS SO MUCH, THAT HE IS ALWAYS UNWILLING
TO GIVE HIS OPINION ON ANY PICTURE; BUT HE HAS AN INNATE
PROPRIETY AND SIMPLICITY OF TASTE, WHICH IN GENERAL
DIRECT HIM PERFECTLY RIGHT."

MARIANNE WAS AFRAID OF OFFENDING, AND SAID NO MORE
ON THE SUBJECT; BUT THE KIND OF APPROBATION WHICH ELINOR
DESCRIBED AS EXCITED IN HIM BY THE DRAWINGS OF OTHER
PEOPLE, WAS VERY FAR FROM THAT RAPTUROUS DELIGHT, WHICH,
IN HER OPINION, COULD ALONE BE CALLED TASTE.  YET, THOUGH
SMILING WITHIN HERSELF AT THE MISTAKE, SHE HONOURED
HER SISTER FOR THAT BLIND PARTIALITY TO EDWARD WHICH PRODUCED IT.

"I HOPE, MARIANNE," CONTINUED ELINOR, "YOU DO NOT
CONSIDER HIM AS DEFICIENT IN GENERAL TASTE.  INDEED, I THINK
I MAY SAY THAT YOU CANNOT, FOR YOUR BEHAVIOUR TO HIM
IS PERFECTLY CORDIAL, AND IF THAT WERE YOUR OPINION,
I AM SURE YOU COULD NEVER BE CIVIL TO HIM."

MARIANNE HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY.  SHE WOULD
NOT WOUND THE FEELINGS OF HER SISTER ON ANY ACCOUNT,
AND YET TO SAY WHAT SHE DID NOT BELIEVE WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
AT LENGTH SHE REPLIED:

"DO NOT BE OFFENDED, ELINOR, IF MY PRAISE OF HIM
IS NOT IN EVERY THING EQUAL TO YOUR SENSE OF HIS MERITS.
I HAVE NOT HAD SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF ESTIMATING THE MINUTER
PROPENSITIES OF HIS MIND, HIS INCLINATIONS AND TASTES,
AS YOU HAVE; BUT I HAVE THE HIGHEST OPINION IN THE WORLD
OF HIS GOODNESS AND SENSE.  I THINK HIM EVERY THING THAT IS
WORTHY AND AMIABLE."

"I AM SURE," REPLIED ELINOR, WITH A SMILE,
"THAT HIS DEAREST FRIENDS COULD NOT BE DISSATISFIED
WITH SUCH COMMENDATION AS THAT.  I DO NOT PERCEIVE
HOW YOU COULD EXPRESS YOURSELF MORE WARMLY."

MARIANNE WAS REJOICED TO FIND HER SISTER SO EASILY PLEASED.

"OF HIS SENSE AND HIS GOODNESS," CONTINUED ELINOR,
"NO ONE CAN, I THINK, BE IN DOUBT, WHO HAS SEEN HIM
OFTEN ENOUGH TO ENGAGE HIM IN UNRESERVED CONVERSATION.
THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS UNDERSTANDING AND HIS PRINCIPLES
CAN BE CONCEALED ONLY BY THAT SHYNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN
KEEPS HIM SILENT.  YOU KNOW ENOUGH OF HIM TO DO JUSTICE
TO HIS SOLID WORTH.  BUT OF HIS MINUTER PROPENSITIES,
AS YOU CALL THEM YOU HAVE FROM PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES
BEEN KEPT MORE IGNORANT THAN MYSELF.  HE AND I HAVE
BEEN AT TIMES THROWN A GOOD DEAL TOGETHER, WHILE YOU
HAVE BEEN WHOLLY ENGROSSED ON THE MOST AFFECTIONATE
PRINCIPLE BY MY MOTHER.  I HAVE SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF HIM,
HAVE STUDIED HIS SENTIMENTS AND HEARD HIS OPINION ON
SUBJECTS OF LITERATURE AND TASTE; AND, UPON THE WHOLE,
I VENTURE TO PRONOUNCE THAT HIS MIND IS WELL-INFORMED,
ENJOYMENT OF BOOKS EXCEEDINGLY GREAT, HIS IMAGINATION LIVELY,
HIS OBSERVATION JUST AND CORRECT, AND HIS TASTE DELICATE
AND PURE.  HIS ABILITIES IN EVERY RESPECT IMPROVE
AS MUCH UPON ACQUAINTANCE AS HIS MANNERS AND PERSON.
AT FIRST SIGHT, HIS ADDRESS IS CERTAINLY NOT STRIKING;
AND HIS PERSON CAN HARDLY BE CALLED HANDSOME, TILL THE
EXPRESSION OF HIS EYES, WHICH ARE UNCOMMONLY GOOD,
AND THE GENERAL SWEETNESS OF HIS COUNTENANCE, IS PERCEIVED.
AT PRESENT, I KNOW HIM SO WELL, THAT I THINK HIM
REALLY HANDSOME; OR AT LEAST, ALMOST SO.  WHAT SAY YOU,
MARIANNE?"

"I SHALL VERY SOON THINK HIM HANDSOME, ELINOR, IF I
DO NOT NOW.  WHEN YOU TELL ME TO LOVE HIM AS A BROTHER,
I SHALL NO MORE SEE IMPERFECTION IN HIS FACE, THAN I NOW DO
IN HIS HEART."

ELINOR STARTED AT THIS DECLARATION, AND WAS SORRY FOR
THE WARMTH SHE HAD BEEN BETRAYED INTO, IN SPEAKING OF HIM.
SHE FELT THAT EDWARD STOOD VERY HIGH IN HER OPINION.
SHE BELIEVED THE REGARD TO BE MUTUAL; BUT SHE REQUIRED
GREATER CERTAINTY OF IT TO MAKE MARIANNE'S CONVICTION
OF THEIR ATTACHMENT AGREEABLE TO HER.  SHE KNEW THAT
WHAT MARIANNE AND HER MOTHER CONJECTURED ONE MOMENT,
THEY BELIEVED THE NEXT--THAT WITH THEM, TO WISH WAS TO HOPE,
AND TO HOPE WAS TO EXPECT.  SHE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE REAL
STATE OF THE CASE TO HER SISTER.

"I DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY," SAID SHE, "THAT I THINK
VERY HIGHLY OF HIM--THAT I GREATLY ESTEEM, THAT I LIKE HIM."

MARIANNE HERE BURST FORTH WITH INDIGNATION--

"ESTEEM HIM! LIKE HIM! COLD-HEARTED ELINOR! OH!
WORSE THAN COLD-HEARTED! ASHAMED OF BEING OTHERWISE.
USE THOSE WORDS AGAIN, AND I WILL LEAVE THE ROOM THIS MOMENT."

ELINOR COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING.  "EXCUSE ME,"
SAID SHE; "AND BE ASSURED THAT I MEANT NO OFFENCE TO YOU,
BY SPEAKING, IN SO QUIET A WAY, OF MY OWN FEELINGS.
BELIEVE THEM TO BE STRONGER THAN I HAVE DECLARED;
BELIEVE THEM, IN SHORT, TO BE SUCH AS HIS MERIT, AND THE
SUSPICION--THE HOPE OF HIS AFFECTION FOR ME MAY WARRANT,
WITHOUT IMPRUDENCE OR FOLLY.  BUT FARTHER THAN THIS YOU MUST
NOT BELIEVE.  I AM BY NO MEANS ASSURED OF HIS REGARD FOR ME.
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE EXTENT OF IT SEEMS DOUBTFUL;
AND TILL HIS SENTIMENTS ARE FULLY KNOWN, YOU CANNOT WONDER
AT MY WISHING TO AVOID ANY ENCOURAGEMENT OF MY OWN PARTIALITY,
BY BELIEVING OR CALLING IT MORE THAN IT IS.  IN MY HEART
I FEEL LITTLE--SCARCELY ANY DOUBT OF HIS PREFERENCE.
BUT THERE ARE OTHER POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED BESIDES
HIS INCLINATION.  HE IS VERY FAR FROM BEING INDEPENDENT.
WHAT HIS MOTHER REALLY IS WE CANNOT KNOW; BUT, FROM FANNY'S
OCCASIONAL MENTION OF HER CONDUCT AND OPINIONS, WE HAVE
NEVER BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK HER AMIABLE; AND I AM VERY
MUCH MISTAKEN IF EDWARD IS NOT HIMSELF AWARE THAT THERE
WOULD BE MANY DIFFICULTIES IN HIS WAY, IF HE WERE TO WISH
TO MARRY A WOMAN WHO HAD NOT EITHER A GREAT FORTUNE OR
HIGH RANK."

MARIANNE WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HOW MUCH THE IMAGINATION
OF HER MOTHER AND HERSELF HAD OUTSTRIPPED THE TRUTH.

"AND YOU REALLY ARE NOT ENGAGED TO HIM!" SAID SHE.
"YET IT CERTAINLY SOON WILL HAPPEN.  BUT TWO ADVANTAGES
WILL PROCEED FROM THIS DELAY.  I SHALL NOT LOSE YOU SO SOON,
AND EDWARD WILL HAVE GREATER OPPORTUNITY OF IMPROVING
THAT NATURAL TASTE FOR YOUR FAVOURITE PURSUIT WHICH MUST
BE SO INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY TO YOUR FUTURE FELICITY.
OH! IF HE SHOULD BE SO FAR STIMULATED BY YOUR GENIUS AS TO
LEARN TO DRAW HIMSELF, HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WOULD BE!"

ELINOR HAD GIVEN HER REAL OPINION TO HER SISTER.
SHE COULD NOT CONSIDER HER PARTIALITY FOR EDWARD
IN SO PROSPEROUS A STATE AS MARIANNE HAD BELIEVED IT.
THERE WAS, AT TIMES, A WANT OF SPIRITS ABOUT HIM WHICH,
IF IT DID NOT DENOTE INDIFFERENCE, SPOKE OF SOMETHING ALMOST
AS UNPROMISING.  A DOUBT OF HER REGARD, SUPPOSING HIM
TO FEEL IT, NEED NOT GIVE HIM MORE THAN INQUIETUDE.
IT WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO PRODUCE THAT DEJECTION OF MIND
WHICH FREQUENTLY ATTENDED HIM.  A MORE REASONABLE CAUSE
MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE DEPENDENT SITUATION WHICH FORBADE
THE INDULGENCE OF HIS AFFECTION.  SHE KNEW THAT HIS MOTHER
NEITHER BEHAVED TO HIM SO AS TO MAKE HIS HOME COMFORTABLE
AT PRESENT, NOR TO GIVE HIM ANY ASSURANCE THAT HE MIGHT FORM
A HOME FOR HIMSELF, WITHOUT STRICTLY ATTENDING TO HER VIEWS
FOR HIS AGGRANDIZEMENT.  WITH SUCH A KNOWLEDGE AS THIS,
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ELINOR TO FEEL EASY ON THE SUBJECT.
SHE WAS FAR FROM DEPENDING ON THAT RESULT OF HIS PREFERENCE
OF HER, WHICH HER MOTHER AND SISTER STILL CONSIDERED
AS CERTAIN.  NAY, THE LONGER THEY WERE TOGETHER THE MORE
DOUBTFUL SEEMED THE NATURE OF HIS REGARD; AND SOMETIMES,
FOR A FEW PAINFUL MINUTES, SHE BELIEVED IT TO BE NO MORE
THAN FRIENDSHIP.

BUT, WHATEVER MIGHT REALLY BE ITS LIMITS, IT WAS ENOUGH,
WHEN PERCEIVED BY HIS SISTER, TO MAKE HER UNEASY,
AND AT THE SAME TIME, (WHICH WAS STILL MORE COMMON,)
TO MAKE HER UNCIVIL.  SHE TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF
AFFRONTING HER MOTHER-IN-LAW ON THE OCCASION, TALKING TO
HER SO EXPRESSIVELY OF HER BROTHER'S GREAT EXPECTATIONS,
OF MRS. FERRARS'S RESOLUTION THAT BOTH HER SONS SHOULD
MARRY WELL, AND OF THE DANGER ATTENDING ANY YOUNG WOMAN
WHO ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIM IN; THAT MRS. DASHWOOD COULD
NEITHER PRETEND TO BE UNCONSCIOUS, NOR ENDEAVOR TO BE CALM.
SHE GAVE HER AN ANSWER WHICH MARKED HER CONTEMPT,
AND INSTANTLY LEFT THE ROOM, RESOLVING THAT, WHATEVER MIGHT
BE THE INCONVENIENCE OR EXPENSE OF SO SUDDEN A REMOVAL,
HER BELOVED ELINOR SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED ANOTHER WEEK
TO SUCH INSINUATIONS.

IN THIS STATE OF HER SPIRITS, A LETTER WAS DELIVERED
TO HER FROM THE POST, WHICH CONTAINED A PROPOSAL
PARTICULARLY WELL TIMED.  IT WAS THE OFFER OF A SMALL HOUSE,
ON VERY EASY TERMS, BELONGING TO A RELATION OF HER OWN,
A GENTLEMAN OF CONSEQUENCE AND PROPERTY IN DEVONSHIRE.
THE LETTER WAS FROM THIS GENTLEMAN HIMSELF, AND WRITTEN
IN THE TRUE SPIRIT OF FRIENDLY ACCOMMODATION.
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS IN NEED OF A DWELLING;
AND THOUGH THE HOUSE HE NOW OFFERED HER WAS MERELY A COTTAGE,
HE ASSURED HER THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE DONE TO IT WHICH
SHE MIGHT THINK NECESSARY, IF THE SITUATION PLEASED HER.
HE EARNESTLY PRESSED HER, AFTER GIVING THE PARTICULARS
OF THE HOUSE AND GARDEN, TO COME WITH HER DAUGHTERS TO
BARTON PARK, THE PLACE OF HIS OWN RESIDENCE, FROM WHENCE
SHE MIGHT JUDGE, HERSELF, WHETHER BARTON COTTAGE, FOR THE
HOUSES WERE IN THE SAME PARISH, COULD, BY ANY ALTERATION,
BE MADE COMFORTABLE TO HER.  HE SEEMED REALLY ANXIOUS TO
ACCOMMODATE THEM AND THE WHOLE OF HIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN
IN SO FRIENDLY A STYLE AS COULD NOT FAIL OF GIVING PLEASURE
TO HIS COUSIN; MORE ESPECIALLY AT A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS
SUFFERING UNDER THE COLD AND UNFEELING BEHAVIOUR OF HER
NEARER CONNECTIONS.  SHE NEEDED NO TIME FOR DELIBERATION
OR INQUIRY.  HER RESOLUTION WAS FORMED AS SHE READ.
THE SITUATION OF BARTON, IN A COUNTY SO FAR DISTANT FROM
SUSSEX AS DEVONSHIRE, WHICH, BUT A FEW HOURS BEFORE,
WOULD HAVE BEEN A SUFFICIENT OBJECTION TO OUTWEIGH EVERY
POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE BELONGING TO THE PLACE, WAS NOW ITS
FIRST RECOMMENDATION.  TO QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF NORLAND
WAS NO LONGER AN EVIL; IT WAS AN OBJECT OF DESIRE;
IT WAS A BLESSING, IN COMPARISON OF THE MISERY OF CONTINUING
HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S GUEST; AND TO REMOVE FOR EVER
FROM THAT BELOVED PLACE WOULD BE LESS PAINFUL THAN TO
INHABIT OR VISIT IT WHILE SUCH A WOMAN WAS ITS MISTRESS.
SHE INSTANTLY WROTE SIR JOHN MIDDLETON HER ACKNOWLEDGMENT
OF HIS KINDNESS, AND HER ACCEPTANCE OF HIS PROPOSAL;
AND THEN HASTENED TO SHEW BOTH LETTERS TO HER DAUGHTERS,
THAT SHE MIGHT BE SECURE OF THEIR APPROBATION BEFORE HER
ANSWER WERE SENT.

ELINOR HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT
FOR THEM TO SETTLE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM NORLAND,
THAN IMMEDIATELY AMONGST THEIR PRESENT ACQUAINTANCE.
ON THAT HEAD, THEREFORE, IT WAS NOT FOR HER TO OPPOSE
HER MOTHER'S INTENTION OF REMOVING INTO DEVONSHIRE.
THE HOUSE, TOO, AS DESCRIBED BY SIR JOHN, WAS ON SO
SIMPLE A SCALE, AND THE RENT SO UNCOMMONLY MODERATE,
AS TO LEAVE HER NO RIGHT OF OBJECTION ON EITHER POINT;
AND, THEREFORE, THOUGH IT WAS NOT A PLAN WHICH BROUGHT
ANY CHARM TO HER FANCY, THOUGH IT WAS A REMOVAL FROM
THE VICINITY OF NORLAND BEYOND HER WISHES, SHE MADE
NO ATTEMPT TO DISSUADE HER MOTHER FROM SENDING A LETTER
OF ACQUIESCENCE.



CHAPTER 5


NO SOONER WAS HER ANSWER DISPATCHED, THAN MRS. DASHWOOD
INDULGED HERSELF IN THE PLEASURE OF ANNOUNCING TO HER
SON-IN-LAW AND HIS WIFE THAT SHE WAS PROVIDED WITH A HOUSE,
AND SHOULD INCOMMODE THEM NO LONGER THAN TILL EVERY THING WERE
READY FOR HER INHABITING IT.  THEY HEARD HER WITH SURPRISE.
MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD SAID NOTHING; BUT HER HUSBAND CIVILLY
HOPED THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE SETTLED FAR FROM NORLAND.
SHE HAD GREAT SATISFACTION IN REPLYING THAT SHE WAS GOING
INTO DEVONSHIRE.--EDWARD TURNED HASTILY TOWARDS HER,
ON HEARING THIS, AND, IN A VOICE OF SURPRISE AND CONCERN,
WHICH REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION TO HER, REPEATED,
"DEVONSHIRE! ARE YOU, INDEED, GOING THERE?  SO FAR FROM HENCE!
AND TO WHAT PART OF IT?"  SHE EXPLAINED THE SITUATION.
IT WAS WITHIN FOUR MILES NORTHWARD OF EXETER.

"IT IS BUT A COTTAGE," SHE CONTINUED, "BUT I HOPE
TO SEE MANY OF MY FRIENDS IN IT.  A ROOM OR TWO CAN
EASILY BE ADDED; AND IF MY FRIENDS FIND NO DIFFICULTY
IN TRAVELLING SO FAR TO SEE ME, I AM SURE I WILL FIND
NONE IN ACCOMMODATING THEM."

SHE CONCLUDED WITH A VERY KIND INVITATION TO
MR. AND MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD TO VISIT HER AT BARTON;
AND TO EDWARD SHE GAVE ONE WITH STILL GREATER AFFECTION.
THOUGH HER LATE CONVERSATION WITH HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW HAD
MADE HER RESOLVE ON REMAINING AT NORLAND NO LONGER THAN
WAS UNAVOIDABLE, IT HAD NOT PRODUCED THE SMALLEST EFFECT
ON HER IN THAT POINT TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY TENDED.
TO SEPARATE EDWARD AND ELINOR WAS AS FAR FROM BEING HER
OBJECT AS EVER; AND SHE WISHED TO SHOW MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD,
BY THIS POINTED INVITATION TO HER BROTHER, HOW TOTALLY SHE
DISREGARDED HER DISAPPROBATION OF THE MATCH.

MR. JOHN DASHWOOD TOLD HIS MOTHER AGAIN AND AGAIN
HOW EXCEEDINGLY SORRY HE WAS THAT SHE HAD TAKEN A HOUSE AT
SUCH A DISTANCE FROM NORLAND AS TO PREVENT HIS BEING OF ANY
SERVICE TO HER IN REMOVING HER FURNITURE.  HE REALLY FELT
CONSCIENTIOUSLY VEXED ON THE OCCASION; FOR THE VERY EXERTION
TO WHICH HE HAD LIMITED THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS PROMISE TO
HIS FATHER WAS BY THIS ARRANGEMENT RENDERED IMPRACTICABLE.--
THE FURNITURE WAS ALL SENT AROUND BY WATER.  IT CHIEFLY
CONSISTED OF HOUSEHOLD LINEN, PLATE, CHINA, AND BOOKS,
WITH A HANDSOME PIANOFORTE OF MARIANNE'S.  MRS. JOHN
DASHWOOD SAW THE PACKAGES DEPART WITH A SIGH: SHE COULD
NOT HELP FEELING IT HARD THAT AS MRS. DASHWOOD'S INCOME
WOULD BE SO TRIFLING IN COMPARISON WITH THEIR OWN,
SHE SHOULD HAVE ANY HANDSOME ARTICLE OF FURNITURE.

MRS. DASHWOOD TOOK THE HOUSE FOR A TWELVEMONTH; IT WAS
READY FURNISHED, AND SHE MIGHT HAVE IMMEDIATE POSSESSION.
NO DIFFICULTY AROSE ON EITHER SIDE IN THE AGREEMENT; AND SHE
WAITED ONLY FOR THE DISPOSAL OF HER EFFECTS AT NORLAND,
AND TO DETERMINE HER FUTURE HOUSEHOLD, BEFORE SHE SET
OFF FOR THE WEST; AND THIS, AS SHE WAS EXCEEDINGLY RAPID
IN THE PERFORMANCE OF EVERYTHING THAT INTERESTED HER,
WAS SOON DONE.--THE HORSES WHICH WERE LEFT HER BY HER HUSBAND
HAD BEEN SOLD SOON AFTER HIS DEATH, AND AN OPPORTUNITY
NOW OFFERING OF DISPOSING OF HER CARRIAGE, SHE AGREED
TO SELL THAT LIKEWISE AT THE EARNEST ADVICE OF HER
ELDEST DAUGHTER.  FOR THE COMFORT OF HER CHILDREN, HAD SHE
CONSULTED ONLY HER OWN WISHES, SHE WOULD HAVE KEPT IT;
BUT THE DISCRETION OF ELINOR PREVAILED.  HER WISDOM
TOO LIMITED THE NUMBER OF THEIR SERVANTS TO THREE;
TWO MAIDS AND A MAN, WITH WHOM THEY WERE SPEEDILY PROVIDED
FROM AMONGST THOSE WHO HAD FORMED THEIR ESTABLISHMENT
AT NORLAND.

THE MAN AND ONE OF THE MAIDS WERE SENT OFF IMMEDIATELY
INTO DEVONSHIRE, TO PREPARE THE HOUSE FOR THEIR MISTRESS'S
ARRIVAL; FOR AS LADY MIDDLETON WAS ENTIRELY UNKNOWN
TO MRS. DASHWOOD, SHE PREFERRED GOING DIRECTLY TO THE
COTTAGE TO BEING A VISITOR AT BARTON PARK; AND SHE RELIED
SO UNDOUBTINGLY ON SIR JOHN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSE,
AS TO FEEL NO CURIOSITY TO EXAMINE IT HERSELF TILL SHE
ENTERED IT AS HER OWN.  HER EAGERNESS TO BE GONE FROM NORLAND
WAS PRESERVED FROM DIMINUTION BY THE EVIDENT SATISFACTION
OF HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW IN THE PROSPECT OF HER REMOVAL;
A SATISFACTION WHICH WAS BUT FEEBLY ATTEMPTED TO BE CONCEALED
UNDER A COLD INVITATION TO HER TO DEFER HER DEPARTURE.
NOW WAS THE TIME WHEN HER SON-IN-LAW'S PROMISE TO HIS
FATHER MIGHT WITH PARTICULAR PROPRIETY BE FULFILLED.
SINCE HE HAD NEGLECTED TO DO IT ON FIRST COMING TO
THE ESTATE, THEIR QUITTING HIS HOUSE MIGHT BE LOOKED
ON AS THE MOST SUITABLE PERIOD FOR ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT.
BUT MRS. DASHWOOD BEGAN SHORTLY TO GIVE OVER EVERY
HOPE OF THE KIND, AND TO BE CONVINCED, FROM THE GENERAL
DRIFT OF HIS DISCOURSE, THAT HIS ASSISTANCE EXTENDED NO
FARTHER THAN THEIR MAINTENANCE FOR SIX MONTHS AT NORLAND.
HE SO FREQUENTLY TALKED OF THE INCREASING EXPENSES
OF HOUSEKEEPING, AND OF THE PERPETUAL DEMANDS UPON HIS PURSE,
WHICH A MAN OF ANY CONSEQUENCE IN THE WORLD WAS BEYOND
CALCULATION EXPOSED TO, THAT HE SEEMED RATHER TO STAND
IN NEED OF MORE MONEY HIMSELF THAN TO HAVE ANY DESIGN OF
GIVING MONEY AWAY.

IN A VERY FEW WEEKS FROM THE DAY WHICH BROUGHT SIR
JOHN MIDDLETON'S FIRST LETTER TO NORLAND, EVERY THING WAS
SO FAR SETTLED IN THEIR FUTURE ABODE AS TO ENABLE
MRS. DASHWOOD AND HER DAUGHTERS TO BEGIN THEIR JOURNEY.

MANY WERE THE TEARS SHED BY THEM IN THEIR LAST
ADIEUS TO A PLACE SO MUCH BELOVED.  "DEAR, DEAR NORLAND!"
SAID MARIANNE, AS SHE WANDERED ALONE BEFORE THE HOUSE,
ON THE LAST EVENING OF THEIR BEING THERE; "WHEN SHALL I CEASE
TO REGRET YOU!--WHEN LEARN TO FEEL A HOME ELSEWHERE!--OH!
HAPPY HOUSE, COULD YOU KNOW WHAT I SUFFER IN NOW VIEWING
YOU FROM THIS SPOT, FROM WHENCE PERHAPS I MAY VIEW
YOU NO MORE!--AND YOU, YE WELL-KNOWN TREES!--BUT YOU
WILL CONTINUE THE SAME.--NO LEAF WILL DECAY BECAUSE WE
ARE REMOVED, NOR ANY BRANCH BECOME MOTIONLESS ALTHOUGH WE
CAN OBSERVE YOU NO LONGER!--NO; YOU WILL CONTINUE THE SAME;
UNCONSCIOUS OF THE PLEASURE OR THE REGRET YOU OCCASION,
AND INSENSIBLE OF ANY CHANGE IN THOSE WHO WALK UNDER YOUR
SHADE!--BUT WHO WILL REMAIN TO ENJOY YOU?"



CHAPTER 6


THE FIRST PART OF THEIR JOURNEY WAS PERFORMED IN TOO
MELANCHOLY A DISPOSITION TO BE OTHERWISE THAN TEDIOUS
AND UNPLEASANT.  BUT AS THEY DREW TOWARDS THE END OF IT,
THEIR INTEREST IN THE APPEARANCE OF A COUNTRY WHICH THEY
WERE TO INHABIT OVERCAME THEIR DEJECTION, AND A VIEW OF
BARTON VALLEY AS THEY ENTERED IT GAVE THEM CHEERFULNESS.
IT WAS A PLEASANT FERTILE SPOT, WELL WOODED, AND RICH
IN PASTURE.  AFTER WINDING ALONG IT FOR MORE THAN A MILE,
THEY REACHED THEIR OWN HOUSE.  A SMALL GREEN COURT WAS
THE WHOLE OF ITS DEMESNE IN FRONT; AND A NEAT WICKET GATE
ADMITTED THEM INTO IT.

AS A HOUSE, BARTON COTTAGE, THOUGH SMALL, WAS COMFORTABLE
AND COMPACT; BUT AS A COTTAGE IT WAS DEFECTIVE, FOR THE
BUILDING WAS REGULAR, THE ROOF WAS TILED, THE WINDOW
SHUTTERS WERE NOT PAINTED GREEN, NOR WERE THE WALLS COVERED
WITH HONEYSUCKLES.  A NARROW PASSAGE LED DIRECTLY THROUGH
THE HOUSE INTO THE GARDEN BEHIND.  ON EACH SIDE OF THE
ENTRANCE WAS A SITTING ROOM, ABOUT SIXTEEN FEET SQUARE;
AND BEYOND THEM WERE THE OFFICES AND THE STAIRS.
FOUR BED-ROOMS AND TWO GARRETS FORMED THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
IT HAD NOT BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS AND WAS IN GOOD REPAIR.
IN COMPARISON OF NORLAND, IT WAS POOR AND SMALL INDEED!--BUT
THE TEARS WHICH RECOLLECTION CALLED FORTH AS THEY ENTERED
THE HOUSE WERE SOON DRIED AWAY.  THEY WERE CHEERED
BY THE JOY OF THE SERVANTS ON THEIR ARRIVAL, AND EACH
FOR THE SAKE OF THE OTHERS RESOLVED TO APPEAR HAPPY.
IT WAS VERY EARLY IN SEPTEMBER; THE SEASON WAS FINE,
AND FROM FIRST SEEING THE PLACE UNDER THE ADVANTAGE
OF GOOD WEATHER, THEY RECEIVED AN IMPRESSION IN ITS
FAVOUR WHICH WAS OF MATERIAL SERVICE IN RECOMMENDING
IT TO THEIR LASTING APPROBATION.

THE SITUATION OF THE HOUSE WAS GOOD.  HIGH HILLS ROSE
IMMEDIATELY BEHIND, AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE ON EACH SIDE;
SOME OF WHICH WERE OPEN DOWNS, THE OTHERS CULTIVATED AND WOODY.
THE VILLAGE OF BARTON WAS CHIEFLY ON ONE OF THESE HILLS,
AND FORMED A PLEASANT VIEW FROM THE COTTAGE WINDOWS.
THE PROSPECT IN FRONT WAS MORE EXTENSIVE; IT COMMANDED THE
WHOLE OF THE VALLEY, AND REACHED INTO THE COUNTRY BEYOND.
THE HILLS WHICH SURROUNDED THE COTTAGE TERMINATED
THE VALLEY IN THAT DIRECTION; UNDER ANOTHER NAME,
AND IN ANOTHER COURSE, IT BRANCHED OUT AGAIN BETWEEN TWO
OF THE STEEPEST OF THEM.

WITH THE SIZE AND FURNITURE OF THE HOUSE MRS. DASHWOOD
WAS UPON THE WHOLE WELL SATISFIED; FOR THOUGH HER FORMER
STYLE OF LIFE RENDERED MANY ADDITIONS TO THE LATTER
INDISPENSABLE, YET TO ADD AND IMPROVE WAS A DELIGHT TO HER;
AND SHE HAD AT THIS TIME READY MONEY ENOUGH TO SUPPLY ALL
THAT WAS WANTED OF GREATER ELEGANCE TO THE APARTMENTS.
"AS FOR THE HOUSE ITSELF, TO BE SURE," SAID SHE, "IT IS
TOO SMALL FOR OUR FAMILY, BUT WE WILL MAKE OURSELVES
TOLERABLY COMFORTABLE FOR THE PRESENT, AS IT IS TOO LATE
IN THE YEAR FOR IMPROVEMENTS.  PERHAPS IN THE SPRING,
IF I HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY, AS I DARE SAY I SHALL, WE MAY
THINK ABOUT BUILDING.  THESE PARLORS ARE BOTH TOO SMALL
FOR SUCH PARTIES OF OUR FRIENDS AS I HOPE TO SEE OFTEN
COLLECTED HERE; AND I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS OF THROWING THE
PASSAGE INTO ONE OF THEM WITH PERHAPS A PART OF THE OTHER,
AND SO LEAVE THE REMAINDER OF THAT OTHER FOR AN ENTRANCE;
THIS, WITH A NEW DRAWING ROOM WHICH MAY BE EASILY ADDED,
AND A BED-CHAMBER AND GARRET ABOVE, WILL MAKE IT A VERY SNUG
LITTLE COTTAGE.  I COULD WISH THE STAIRS WERE HANDSOME.
BUT ONE MUST NOT EXPECT EVERY THING; THOUGH I SUPPOSE IT
WOULD BE NO DIFFICULT MATTER TO WIDEN THEM.  I SHALL SEE
HOW MUCH I AM BEFORE-HAND WITH THE WORLD IN THE SPRING,
AND WE WILL PLAN OUR IMPROVEMENTS ACCORDINGLY."

IN THE MEAN TIME, TILL ALL THESE ALTERATIONS COULD
BE MADE FROM THE SAVINGS OF AN INCOME OF FIVE HUNDRED
A-YEAR BY A WOMAN WHO NEVER SAVED IN HER LIFE, THEY WERE
WISE ENOUGH TO BE CONTENTED WITH THE HOUSE AS IT WAS;
AND EACH OF THEM WAS BUSY IN ARRANGING THEIR PARTICULAR
CONCERNS, AND ENDEAVORING, BY PLACING AROUND THEM BOOKS
AND OTHER POSSESSIONS, TO FORM THEMSELVES A HOME.
MARIANNE'S PIANOFORTE WAS UNPACKED AND PROPERLY DISPOSED OF;
AND ELINOR'S DRAWINGS WERE AFFIXED TO THE WALLS OF THEIR
SITTING ROOM.

IN SUCH EMPLOYMENTS AS THESE THEY WERE INTERRUPTED
SOON AFTER BREAKFAST THE NEXT DAY BY THE ENTRANCE OF
THEIR LANDLORD, WHO CALLED TO WELCOME THEM TO BARTON,
AND TO OFFER THEM EVERY ACCOMMODATION FROM HIS OWN HOUSE
AND GARDEN IN WHICH THEIRS MIGHT AT PRESENT BE DEFICIENT.
SIR JOHN MIDDLETON WAS A GOOD LOOKING MAN ABOUT FORTY.
HE HAD FORMERLY VISITED AT STANHILL, BUT IT WAS TOO LONG
FOR HIS YOUNG COUSINS TO REMEMBER HIM.  HIS COUNTENANCE
WAS THOROUGHLY GOOD-HUMOURED; AND HIS MANNERS WERE
AS FRIENDLY AS THE STYLE OF HIS LETTER.  THEIR ARRIVAL
SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM REAL SATISFACTION, AND THEIR COMFORT
TO BE AN OBJECT OF REAL SOLICITUDE TO HIM.  HE SAID MUCH
OF HIS EARNEST DESIRE OF THEIR LIVING IN THE MOST SOCIABLE
TERMS WITH HIS FAMILY, AND PRESSED THEM SO CORDIALLY
TO DINE AT BARTON PARK EVERY DAY TILL THEY WERE BETTER
SETTLED AT HOME, THAT, THOUGH HIS ENTREATIES WERE CARRIED
TO A POINT OF PERSEVERANCE BEYOND CIVILITY, THEY COULD
NOT GIVE OFFENCE.  HIS KINDNESS WAS NOT CONFINED TO WORDS;
FOR WITHIN AN HOUR AFTER HE LEFT THEM, A LARGE BASKET
FULL OF GARDEN STUFF AND FRUIT ARRIVED FROM THE PARK,
WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY BY A PRESENT
OF GAME.  HE INSISTED, MOREOVER, ON CONVEYING ALL THEIR
LETTERS TO AND FROM THE POST FOR THEM, AND WOULD NOT BE
DENIED THE SATISFACTION OF SENDING THEM HIS NEWSPAPER
EVERY DAY.

LADY MIDDLETON HAD SENT A VERY CIVIL MESSAGE BY HIM,
DENOTING HER INTENTION OF WAITING ON MRS. DASHWOOD AS SOON AS
SHE COULD BE ASSURED THAT HER VISIT WOULD BE NO INCONVENIENCE;
AND AS THIS MESSAGE WAS ANSWERED BY AN INVITATION
EQUALLY POLITE, HER LADYSHIP WAS INTRODUCED TO THEM THE NEXT DAY.

THEY WERE, OF COURSE, VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE A PERSON ON
WHOM SO MUCH OF THEIR COMFORT AT BARTON MUST DEPEND; AND THE
ELEGANCE OF HER APPEARANCE WAS FAVOURABLE TO THEIR WISHES.
LADY MIDDLETON WAS NOT MORE THAN SIX OR SEVEN AND TWENTY;
HER FACE WAS HANDSOME, HER FIGURE TALL AND STRIKING,
AND HER ADDRESS GRACEFUL.  HER MANNERS HAD ALL THE ELEGANCE
WHICH HER HUSBAND'S WANTED.  BUT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN
IMPROVED BY SOME SHARE OF HIS FRANKNESS AND WARMTH;
AND HER VISIT WAS LONG ENOUGH TO DETRACT SOMETHING FROM
THEIR FIRST ADMIRATION, BY SHEWING THAT, THOUGH PERFECTLY
WELL-BRED, SHE WAS RESERVED, COLD, AND HAD NOTHING TO SAY
FOR HERSELF BEYOND THE MOST COMMON-PLACE INQUIRY OR REMARK.

CONVERSATION HOWEVER WAS NOT WANTED, FOR SIR JOHN
WAS VERY CHATTY, AND LADY MIDDLETON HAD TAKEN THE WISE
PRECAUTION OF BRINGING WITH HER THEIR ELDEST CHILD, A FINE
LITTLE BOY ABOUT SIX YEARS OLD, BY WHICH MEANS THERE WAS
ONE SUBJECT ALWAYS TO BE RECURRED TO BY THE LADIES IN CASE
OF EXTREMITY, FOR THEY HAD TO ENQUIRE HIS NAME AND AGE,
ADMIRE HIS BEAUTY, AND ASK HIM QUESTIONS WHICH HIS MOTHER
ANSWERED FOR HIM, WHILE HE HUNG ABOUT HER AND HELD
DOWN HIS HEAD, TO THE GREAT SURPRISE OF HER LADYSHIP,
WHO WONDERED AT HIS BEING SO SHY BEFORE COMPANY, AS HE
COULD MAKE NOISE ENOUGH AT HOME.  ON EVERY FORMAL VISIT
A CHILD OUGHT TO BE OF THE PARTY, BY WAY OF PROVISION
FOR DISCOURSE.  IN THE PRESENT CASE IT TOOK UP TEN MINUTES
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE BOY WERE MOST LIKE HIS FATHER
OR MOTHER, AND IN WHAT PARTICULAR HE RESEMBLED EITHER,
FOR OF COURSE EVERY BODY DIFFERED, AND EVERY BODY WAS
ASTONISHED AT THE OPINION OF THE OTHERS.

AN OPPORTUNITY WAS SOON TO BE GIVEN TO THE DASHWOODS
OF DEBATING ON THE REST OF THE CHILDREN, AS SIR JOHN
WOULD NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT SECURING THEIR PROMISE
OF DINING AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY.



CHAPTER 7


BARTON PARK WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE COTTAGE.
THE LADIES HAD PASSED NEAR IT IN THEIR WAY ALONG THE VALLEY,
BUT IT WAS SCREENED FROM THEIR VIEW AT HOME BY THE
PROJECTION OF A HILL.  THE HOUSE WAS LARGE AND HANDSOME;
AND THE MIDDLETONS LIVED IN A STYLE OF EQUAL HOSPITALITY
AND ELEGANCE.  THE FORMER WAS FOR SIR JOHN'S GRATIFICATION,
THE LATTER FOR THAT OF HIS LADY.  THEY WERE SCARCELY
EVER WITHOUT SOME FRIENDS STAYING WITH THEM IN THE HOUSE,
AND THEY KEPT MORE COMPANY OF EVERY KIND THAN ANY OTHER
FAMILY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.  IT WAS NECESSARY TO THE
HAPPINESS OF BOTH; FOR HOWEVER DISSIMILAR IN TEMPER
AND OUTWARD BEHAVIOUR, THEY STRONGLY RESEMBLED EACH OTHER
IN THAT TOTAL WANT OF TALENT AND TASTE WHICH CONFINED
THEIR EMPLOYMENTS, UNCONNECTED WITH SUCH AS SOCIETY PRODUCED,
WITHIN A VERY NARROW COMPASS.  SIR JOHN WAS A SPORTSMAN,
LADY MIDDLETON A MOTHER.  HE HUNTED AND SHOT, AND SHE
HUMOURED HER CHILDREN; AND THESE WERE THEIR ONLY RESOURCES.
LADY MIDDLETON HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE TO SPOIL HER
CHILDREN ALL THE YEAR ROUND, WHILE SIR JOHN'S INDEPENDENT
EMPLOYMENTS WERE IN EXISTENCE ONLY HALF THE TIME.
CONTINUAL ENGAGEMENTS AT HOME AND ABROAD, HOWEVER,
SUPPLIED ALL THE DEFICIENCIES OF NATURE AND EDUCATION;
SUPPORTED THE GOOD SPIRITS OF SIR JOHN, AND GAVE EXERCISE
TO THE GOOD BREEDING OF HIS WIFE.

LADY MIDDLETON PIQUED HERSELF UPON THE ELEGANCE
OF HER TABLE, AND OF ALL HER DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS;
AND FROM THIS KIND OF VANITY WAS HER GREATEST ENJOYMENT
IN ANY OF THEIR PARTIES.  BUT SIR JOHN'S SATISFACTION
IN SOCIETY WAS MUCH MORE REAL; HE DELIGHTED IN COLLECTING
ABOUT HIM MORE YOUNG PEOPLE THAN HIS HOUSE WOULD HOLD,
AND THE NOISIER THEY WERE THE BETTER WAS HE PLEASED.
HE WAS A BLESSING TO ALL THE JUVENILE PART OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD,
FOR IN SUMMER HE WAS FOR EVER FORMING PARTIES TO EAT COLD
HAM AND CHICKEN OUT OF DOORS, AND IN WINTER HIS PRIVATE
BALLS WERE NUMEROUS ENOUGH FOR ANY YOUNG LADY WHO WAS NOT
SUFFERING UNDER THE UNSATIABLE APPETITE OF FIFTEEN.

THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW FAMILY IN THE COUNTRY WAS ALWAYS
A MATTER OF JOY TO HIM, AND IN EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE WAS
CHARMED WITH THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOW PROCURED FOR HIS
COTTAGE AT BARTON.  THE MISS DASHWOODS WERE YOUNG, PRETTY,
AND UNAFFECTED.  IT WAS ENOUGH TO SECURE HIS GOOD OPINION;
FOR TO BE UNAFFECTED WAS ALL THAT A PRETTY GIRL COULD
WANT TO MAKE HER MIND AS CAPTIVATING AS HER PERSON.
THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS DISPOSITION MADE HIM HAPPY IN
ACCOMMODATING THOSE, WHOSE SITUATION MIGHT BE CONSIDERED,
IN COMPARISON WITH THE PAST, AS UNFORTUNATE.  IN SHOWING
KINDNESS TO HIS COUSINS THEREFORE HE HAD THE REAL SATISFACTION
OF A GOOD HEART; AND IN SETTLING A FAMILY OF FEMALES ONLY
IN HIS COTTAGE, HE HAD ALL THE SATISFACTION OF A SPORTSMAN;
FOR A SPORTSMAN, THOUGH HE ESTEEMS ONLY THOSE OF HIS SEX WHO
ARE SPORTSMEN LIKEWISE, IS NOT OFTEN DESIROUS OF ENCOURAGING
THEIR TASTE BY ADMITTING THEM TO A RESIDENCE WITHIN HIS OWN
MANOR.

MRS. DASHWOOD AND HER DAUGHTERS WERE MET AT THE DOOR
OF THE HOUSE BY SIR JOHN, WHO WELCOMED THEM TO BARTON
PARK WITH UNAFFECTED SINCERITY; AND AS HE ATTENDED THEM
TO THE DRAWING ROOM REPEATED TO THE YOUNG LADIES THE CONCERN
WHICH THE SAME SUBJECT HAD DRAWN FROM HIM THE DAY BEFORE,
AT BEING UNABLE TO GET ANY SMART YOUNG MEN TO MEET THEM.
THEY WOULD SEE, HE SAID, ONLY ONE GENTLEMAN THERE
BESIDES HIMSELF; A PARTICULAR FRIEND WHO WAS STAYING AT
THE PARK, BUT WHO WAS NEITHER VERY YOUNG NOR VERY GAY.
HE HOPED THEY WOULD ALL EXCUSE THE SMALLNESS OF THE PARTY,
AND COULD ASSURE THEM IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN SO AGAIN.
HE HAD BEEN TO SEVERAL FAMILIES THAT MORNING IN HOPES
OF PROCURING SOME ADDITION TO THEIR NUMBER, BUT IT
WAS MOONLIGHT AND EVERY BODY WAS FULL OF ENGAGEMENTS.
LUCKILY LADY MIDDLETON'S MOTHER HAD ARRIVED AT BARTON
WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, AND AS SHE WAS A VERY CHEERFUL
AGREEABLE WOMAN, HE HOPED THE YOUNG LADIES WOULD NOT FIND
IT SO VERY DULL AS THEY MIGHT IMAGINE.  THE YOUNG LADIES,
AS WELL AS THEIR MOTHER, WERE PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH
HAVING TWO ENTIRE STRANGERS OF THE PARTY, AND WISHED FOR
NO MORE.

MRS. JENNINGS, LADY MIDDLETON'S MOTHER, WAS A
GOOD-HUMOURED, MERRY, FAT, ELDERLY WOMAN, WHO TALKED A
GREAT DEAL, SEEMED VERY HAPPY, AND RATHER VULGAR.  SHE WAS FULL
OF JOKES AND LAUGHTER, AND BEFORE DINNER WAS OVER HAD SAID
MANY WITTY THINGS ON THE SUBJECT OF LOVERS AND HUSBANDS;
HOPED THEY HAD NOT LEFT THEIR HEARTS BEHIND THEM IN SUSSEX,
AND PRETENDED TO SEE THEM BLUSH WHETHER THEY DID OR NOT.
MARIANNE WAS VEXED AT IT FOR HER SISTER'S SAKE, AND TURNED
HER EYES TOWARDS ELINOR TO SEE HOW SHE BORE THESE ATTACKS,
WITH AN EARNESTNESS WHICH GAVE ELINOR FAR MORE PAIN THAN
COULD ARISE FROM SUCH COMMON-PLACE RAILLERY AS MRS. JENNINGS'S.

COLONEL BRANDON, THE FRIEND OF SIR JOHN, SEEMED NO
MORE ADAPTED BY RESEMBLANCE OF MANNER TO BE HIS FRIEND,
THAN LADY MIDDLETON WAS TO BE HIS WIFE, OR MRS. JENNINGS
TO BE LADY MIDDLETON'S MOTHER.  HE WAS SILENT AND GRAVE.
HIS APPEARANCE HOWEVER WAS NOT UNPLEASING, IN SPITE
OF HIS BEING IN THE OPINION OF MARIANNE AND MARGARET
AN ABSOLUTE OLD BACHELOR, FOR HE WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF FIVE AND THIRTY; BUT THOUGH HIS FACE WAS NOT HANDSOME,
HIS COUNTENANCE WAS SENSIBLE, AND HIS ADDRESS WAS
PARTICULARLY GENTLEMANLIKE.

THERE WAS NOTHING IN ANY OF THE PARTY WHICH COULD
RECOMMEND THEM AS COMPANIONS TO THE DASHWOODS; BUT THE COLD
INSIPIDITY OF LADY MIDDLETON WAS SO PARTICULARLY REPULSIVE,
THAT IN COMPARISON OF IT THE GRAVITY OF COLONEL BRANDON,
AND EVEN THE BOISTEROUS MIRTH OF SIR JOHN AND HIS
MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS INTERESTING.  LADY MIDDLETON SEEMED
TO BE ROUSED TO ENJOYMENT ONLY BY THE ENTRANCE OF HER
FOUR NOISY CHILDREN AFTER DINNER, WHO PULLED HER ABOUT,
TORE HER CLOTHES, AND PUT AN END TO EVERY KIND OF DISCOURSE
EXCEPT WHAT RELATED TO THEMSELVES.

IN THE EVENING, AS MARIANNE WAS DISCOVERED TO BE MUSICAL,
SHE WAS INVITED TO PLAY.  THE INSTRUMENT WAS UNLOCKED,
EVERY BODY PREPARED TO BE CHARMED, AND MARIANNE,
WHO SANG VERY WELL, AT THEIR REQUEST WENT THROUGH THE
CHIEF OF THE SONGS WHICH LADY MIDDLETON HAD BROUGHT INTO
THE FAMILY ON HER MARRIAGE, AND WHICH PERHAPS HAD LAIN
EVER SINCE IN THE SAME POSITION ON THE PIANOFORTE,
FOR HER LADYSHIP HAD CELEBRATED THAT EVENT BY GIVING
UP MUSIC, ALTHOUGH BY HER MOTHER'S ACCOUNT, SHE HAD
PLAYED EXTREMELY WELL, AND BY HER OWN WAS VERY FOND OF IT.

MARIANNE'S PERFORMANCE WAS HIGHLY APPLAUDED.
SIR JOHN WAS LOUD IN HIS ADMIRATION AT THE END OF EVERY SONG,
AND AS LOUD IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE OTHERS WHILE EVERY
SONG LASTED.  LADY MIDDLETON FREQUENTLY CALLED HIM TO ORDER,
WONDERED HOW ANY ONE'S ATTENTION COULD BE DIVERTED FROM MUSIC
FOR A MOMENT, AND ASKED MARIANNE TO SING A PARTICULAR SONG
WHICH MARIANNE HAD JUST FINISHED.  COLONEL BRANDON ALONE,
OF ALL THE PARTY, HEARD HER WITHOUT BEING IN RAPTURES.
HE PAID HER ONLY THE COMPLIMENT OF ATTENTION; AND SHE FELT
A RESPECT FOR HIM ON THE OCCASION, WHICH THE OTHERS HAD
REASONABLY FORFEITED BY THEIR SHAMELESS WANT OF TASTE.
HIS PLEASURE IN MUSIC, THOUGH IT AMOUNTED NOT TO THAT
ECSTATIC DELIGHT WHICH ALONE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH HER OWN,
WAS ESTIMABLE WHEN CONTRASTED AGAINST THE HORRIBLE
INSENSIBILITY OF THE OTHERS; AND SHE WAS REASONABLE ENOUGH
TO ALLOW THAT A MAN OF FIVE AND THIRTY MIGHT WELL HAVE
OUTLIVED ALL ACUTENESS OF FEELING AND EVERY EXQUISITE
POWER OF ENJOYMENT.  SHE WAS PERFECTLY DISPOSED TO MAKE
EVERY ALLOWANCE FOR THE COLONEL'S ADVANCED STATE OF LIFE
WHICH HUMANITY REQUIRED.



CHAPTER 8


MRS. JENNINGS WAS A WIDOW WITH AN AMPLE JOINTURE.
SHE HAD ONLY TWO DAUGHTERS, BOTH OF WHOM SHE HAD LIVED
TO SEE RESPECTABLY MARRIED, AND SHE HAD NOW THEREFORE
NOTHING TO DO BUT TO MARRY ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD.
IN THE PROMOTION OF THIS OBJECT SHE WAS ZEALOUSLY ACTIVE,
AS FAR AS HER ABILITY REACHED; AND MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY
OF PROJECTING WEDDINGS AMONG ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE
OF HER ACQUAINTANCE.  SHE WAS REMARKABLY QUICK IN THE
DISCOVERY OF ATTACHMENTS, AND HAD ENJOYED THE ADVANTAGE
OF RAISING THE BLUSHES AND THE VANITY OF MANY A YOUNG
LADY BY INSINUATIONS OF HER POWER OVER SUCH A YOUNG MAN;
AND THIS KIND OF DISCERNMENT ENABLED HER SOON AFTER HER
ARRIVAL AT BARTON DECISIVELY TO PRONOUNCE THAT COLONEL
BRANDON WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH MARIANNE DASHWOOD.
SHE RATHER SUSPECTED IT TO BE SO, ON THE VERY FIRST
EVENING OF THEIR BEING TOGETHER, FROM HIS LISTENING
SO ATTENTIVELY WHILE SHE SANG TO THEM; AND WHEN THE VISIT
WAS RETURNED BY THE MIDDLETONS' DINING AT THE COTTAGE,
THE FACT WAS ASCERTAINED BY HIS LISTENING TO HER AGAIN.
IT MUST BE SO.  SHE WAS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF IT.
IT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT MATCH, FOR HE WAS RICH, AND SHE
WAS HANDSOME.  MRS. JENNINGS HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO SEE
COLONEL BRANDON WELL MARRIED, EVER SINCE HER CONNECTION
WITH SIR JOHN FIRST BROUGHT HIM TO HER KNOWLEDGE;
AND SHE WAS ALWAYS ANXIOUS TO GET A GOOD HUSBAND FOR EVERY
PRETTY GIRL.

THE IMMEDIATE ADVANTAGE TO HERSELF WAS BY NO MEANS
INCONSIDERABLE, FOR IT SUPPLIED HER WITH ENDLESS JOKES
AGAINST THEM BOTH.  AT THE PARK SHE LAUGHED AT THE COLONEL,
AND IN THE COTTAGE AT MARIANNE.  TO THE FORMER HER
RAILLERY WAS PROBABLY, AS FAR AS IT REGARDED ONLY HIMSELF,
PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT; BUT TO THE LATTER IT WAS AT
FIRST INCOMPREHENSIBLE; AND WHEN ITS OBJECT WAS UNDERSTOOD,
SHE HARDLY KNEW WHETHER MOST TO LAUGH AT ITS ABSURDITY,
OR CENSURE ITS IMPERTINENCE, FOR SHE CONSIDERED IT AS AN
UNFEELING REFLECTION ON THE COLONEL'S ADVANCED YEARS,
AND ON HIS FORLORN CONDITION AS AN OLD BACHELOR.

MRS. DASHWOOD, WHO COULD NOT THINK A MAN FIVE YEARS
YOUNGER THAN HERSELF, SO EXCEEDINGLY ANCIENT AS HE APPEARED
TO THE YOUTHFUL FANCY OF HER DAUGHTER, VENTURED TO CLEAR
MRS. JENNINGS FROM THE PROBABILITY OF WISHING TO THROW
RIDICULE ON HIS AGE.

"BUT AT LEAST, MAMMA, YOU CANNOT DENY THE ABSURDITY
OF THE ACCUSATION, THOUGH YOU MAY NOT THINK IT INTENTIONALLY
ILL-NATURED.  COLONEL BRANDON IS CERTAINLY YOUNGER THAN
MRS. JENNINGS, BUT HE IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE MY FATHER;
AND IF HE WERE EVER ANIMATED ENOUGH TO BE IN LOVE,
MUST HAVE LONG OUTLIVED EVERY SENSATION OF THE KIND.
IT IS TOO RIDICULOUS!  WHEN IS A MAN TO BE SAFE FROM SUCH WIT,
IF AGE AND INFIRMITY WILL NOT PROTECT HIM?"

"INFIRMITY!" SAID ELINOR, "DO YOU CALL COLONEL BRANDON
INFIRM?  I CAN EASILY SUPPOSE THAT HIS AGE MAY APPEAR MUCH
GREATER TO YOU THAN TO MY MOTHER; BUT YOU CAN HARDLY
DECEIVE YOURSELF AS TO HIS HAVING THE USE OF HIS LIMBS!"

"DID NOT YOU HEAR HIM COMPLAIN OF THE RHEUMATISM?
AND IS NOT THAT THE COMMONEST INFIRMITY OF DECLINING LIFE?"

"MY DEAREST CHILD," SAID HER MOTHER, LAUGHING,
"AT THIS RATE YOU MUST BE IN CONTINUAL TERROR OF MY DECAY;
AND IT MUST SEEM TO YOU A MIRACLE THAT MY LIFE HAS BEEN
EXTENDED TO THE ADVANCED AGE OF FORTY."

"MAMMA, YOU ARE NOT DOING ME JUSTICE.  I KNOW VERY WELL
THAT COLONEL BRANDON IS NOT OLD ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS FRIENDS
YET APPREHENSIVE OF LOSING HIM IN THE COURSE OF NATURE.
HE MAY LIVE TWENTY YEARS LONGER.  BUT THIRTY-FIVE HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH MATRIMONY."

"PERHAPS," SAID ELINOR, "THIRTY-FIVE AND SEVENTEEN HAD
BETTER NOT HAVE ANY THING TO DO WITH MATRIMONY TOGETHER.
BUT IF THERE SHOULD BY ANY CHANCE HAPPEN TO BE A WOMAN
WHO IS SINGLE AT SEVEN AND TWENTY, I SHOULD NOT THINK
COLONEL BRANDON'S BEING THIRTY-FIVE ANY OBJECTION TO HIS
MARRYING HER."

"A WOMAN OF SEVEN AND TWENTY," SAID MARIANNE,
AFTER PAUSING A MOMENT, "CAN NEVER HOPE TO FEEL OR INSPIRE
AFFECTION AGAIN, AND IF HER HOME BE UNCOMFORTABLE,
OR HER FORTUNE SMALL, I CAN SUPPOSE THAT SHE MIGHT
BRING HERSELF TO SUBMIT TO THE OFFICES OF A NURSE,
FOR THE SAKE OF THE PROVISION AND SECURITY OF A WIFE.
IN HIS MARRYING SUCH A WOMAN THEREFORE THERE WOULD BE
NOTHING UNSUITABLE.  IT WOULD BE A COMPACT OF CONVENIENCE,
AND THE WORLD WOULD BE SATISFIED.  IN MY EYES IT WOULD
BE NO MARRIAGE AT ALL, BUT THAT WOULD BE NOTHING.
TO ME IT WOULD SEEM ONLY A COMMERCIAL EXCHANGE, IN WHICH
EACH WISHED TO BE BENEFITED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OTHER."

"IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE, I KNOW," REPLIED ELINOR,
"TO CONVINCE YOU THAT A WOMAN OF SEVEN AND TWENTY COULD
FEEL FOR A MAN OF THIRTY-FIVE ANYTHING NEAR ENOUGH
TO LOVE, TO MAKE HIM A DESIRABLE COMPANION TO HER.
BUT I MUST OBJECT TO YOUR DOOMING COLONEL BRANDON AND
HIS WIFE TO THE CONSTANT CONFINEMENT OF A SICK CHAMBER,
MERELY BECAUSE HE CHANCED TO COMPLAIN YESTERDAY (A
VERY COLD DAMP DAY) OF A SLIGHT RHEUMATIC FEEL IN ONE
OF HIS SHOULDERS."

"BUT HE TALKED OF FLANNEL WAISTCOATS," SAID MARIANNE;
"AND WITH ME A FLANNEL WAISTCOAT IS INVARIABLY CONNECTED
WITH ACHES, CRAMPS, RHEUMATISMS, AND EVERY SPECIES OF
AILMENT THAT CAN AFFLICT THE OLD AND THE FEEBLE."

"HAD HE BEEN ONLY IN A VIOLENT FEVER, YOU WOULD NOT
HAVE DESPISED HIM HALF SO MUCH.  CONFESS, MARIANNE, IS NOT
THERE SOMETHING INTERESTING TO YOU IN THE FLUSHED CHEEK,
HOLLOW EYE, AND QUICK PULSE OF A FEVER?"

SOON AFTER THIS, UPON ELINOR'S LEAVING THE ROOM,
"MAMMA," SAID MARIANNE, "I HAVE AN ALARM ON THE SUBJECT
OF ILLNESS WHICH I CANNOT CONCEAL FROM YOU.  I AM SURE
EDWARD FERRARS IS NOT WELL.  WE HAVE NOW BEEN HERE ALMOST
A FORTNIGHT, AND YET HE DOES NOT COME.  NOTHING BUT REAL
INDISPOSITION COULD OCCASION THIS EXTRAORDINARY DELAY.
WHAT ELSE CAN DETAIN HIM AT NORLAND?"

"HAD YOU ANY IDEA OF HIS COMING SO SOON?"
SAID MRS. DASHWOOD.  "I HAD NONE.  ON THE CONTRARY,
IF I HAVE FELT ANY ANXIETY AT ALL ON THE SUBJECT, IT HAS
BEEN IN RECOLLECTING THAT HE SOMETIMES SHOWED A WANT
OF PLEASURE AND READINESS IN ACCEPTING MY INVITATION,
WHEN I TALKED OF HIS COMING TO BARTON.  DOES ELINOR
EXPECT HIM ALREADY?"

"I HAVE NEVER MENTIONED IT TO HER, BUT OF COURSE
SHE MUST."

"I RATHER THINK YOU ARE MISTAKEN, FOR WHEN I
WAS TALKING TO HER YESTERDAY OF GETTING A NEW GRATE
FOR THE SPARE BEDCHAMBER, SHE OBSERVED THAT THERE
WAS NO IMMEDIATE HURRY FOR IT, AS IT WAS NOT LIKELY
THAT THE ROOM WOULD BE WANTED FOR SOME TIME."

"HOW STRANGE THIS IS! WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF IT!
BUT THE WHOLE OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR TO EACH OTHER HAS BEEN
UNACCOUNTABLE! HOW COLD, HOW COMPOSED WERE THEIR LAST
ADIEUS! HOW LANGUID THEIR CONVERSATION THE LAST EVENING
OF THEIR BEING TOGETHER! IN EDWARD'S FAREWELL THERE WAS NO
DISTINCTION BETWEEN ELINOR AND ME: IT WAS THE GOOD WISHES
OF AN AFFECTIONATE BROTHER TO BOTH.  TWICE DID I LEAVE
THEM PURPOSELY TOGETHER IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST MORNING,
AND EACH TIME DID HE MOST UNACCOUNTABLY FOLLOW ME OUT
OF THE ROOM.  AND ELINOR, IN QUITTING NORLAND AND EDWARD,
CRIED NOT AS I DID.  EVEN NOW HER SELF-COMMAND IS INVARIABLE.
WHEN IS SHE DEJECTED OR MELANCHOLY? WHEN DOES SHE TRY
TO AVOID SOCIETY, OR APPEAR RESTLESS AND DISSATISFIED
IN IT?"



CHAPTER 9


THE DASHWOODS WERE NOW SETTLED AT BARTON WITH TOLERABLE
COMFORT TO THEMSELVES.  THE HOUSE AND THE GARDEN, WITH ALL
THE OBJECTS SURROUNDING THEM, WERE NOW BECOME FAMILIAR,
AND THE ORDINARY PURSUITS WHICH HAD GIVEN TO NORLAND
HALF ITS CHARMS WERE ENGAGED IN AGAIN WITH FAR GREATER
ENJOYMENT THAN NORLAND HAD BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD, SINCE THE
LOSS OF THEIR FATHER.  SIR JOHN MIDDLETON, WHO CALLED
ON THEM EVERY DAY FOR THE FIRST FORTNIGHT, AND WHO WAS
NOT IN THE HABIT OF SEEING MUCH OCCUPATION AT HOME,
COULD NOT CONCEAL HIS AMAZEMENT ON FINDING THEM ALWAYS EMPLOYED.

THEIR VISITORS, EXCEPT THOSE FROM BARTON PARK,
WERE NOT MANY; FOR, IN SPITE OF SIR JOHN'S URGENT ENTREATIES
THAT THEY WOULD MIX MORE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, AND REPEATED
ASSURANCES OF HIS CARRIAGE BEING ALWAYS AT THEIR SERVICE,
THE INDEPENDENCE OF MRS. DASHWOOD'S SPIRIT OVERCAME THE
WISH OF SOCIETY FOR HER CHILDREN; AND SHE WAS RESOLUTE
IN DECLINING TO VISIT ANY FAMILY BEYOND THE DISTANCE
OF A WALK.  THERE WERE BUT FEW WHO COULD BE SO CLASSED;
AND IT WAS NOT ALL OF THEM THAT WERE ATTAINABLE.
ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE COTTAGE, ALONG THE NARROW
WINDING VALLEY OF ALLENHAM, WHICH ISSUED FROM THAT OF BARTON,
AS FORMERLY DESCRIBED, THE GIRLS HAD, IN ONE OF THEIR
EARLIEST WALKS, DISCOVERED AN ANCIENT RESPECTABLE LOOKING
MANSION WHICH, BY REMINDING THEM A LITTLE OF NORLAND,
INTERESTED THEIR IMAGINATION AND MADE THEM WISH TO BE
BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH IT.  BUT THEY LEARNT, ON ENQUIRY,
THAT ITS POSSESSOR, AN ELDERLY LADY OF VERY GOOD CHARACTER,
WAS UNFORTUNATELY TOO INFIRM TO MIX WITH THE WORLD,
AND NEVER STIRRED FROM HOME.

THE WHOLE COUNTRY ABOUT THEM ABOUNDED IN BEAUTIFUL WALKS.
THE HIGH DOWNS WHICH INVITED THEM FROM ALMOST EVERY WINDOW
OF THE COTTAGE TO SEEK THE EXQUISITE ENJOYMENT OF AIR
ON THEIR SUMMITS, WERE A HAPPY ALTERNATIVE WHEN THE DIRT
OF THE VALLEYS BENEATH SHUT UP THEIR SUPERIOR BEAUTIES;
AND TOWARDS ONE OF THESE HILLS DID MARIANNE AND MARGARET
ONE MEMORABLE MORNING DIRECT THEIR STEPS, ATTRACTED BY THE
PARTIAL SUNSHINE OF A SHOWERY SKY, AND UNABLE LONGER TO BEAR
THE CONFINEMENT WHICH THE SETTLED RAIN OF THE TWO PRECEDING
DAYS HAD OCCASIONED.  THE WEATHER WAS NOT TEMPTING ENOUGH
TO DRAW THE TWO OTHERS FROM THEIR PENCIL AND THEIR BOOK,
IN SPITE OF MARIANNE'S DECLARATION THAT THE DAY WOULD
BE LASTINGLY FAIR, AND THAT EVERY THREATENING CLOUD WOULD
BE DRAWN OFF FROM THEIR HILLS; AND THE TWO GIRLS SET OFF
TOGETHER.

THEY GAILY ASCENDED THE DOWNS, REJOICING IN THEIR OWN
PENETRATION AT EVERY GLIMPSE OF BLUE SKY; AND WHEN THEY
CAUGHT IN THEIR FACES THE ANIMATING GALES OF A HIGH
SOUTH-WESTERLY WIND, THEY PITIED THE FEARS WHICH HAD PREVENTED
THEIR MOTHER AND ELINOR FROM SHARING SUCH DELIGHTFUL SENSATIONS.

"IS THERE A FELICITY IN THE WORLD," SAID MARIANNE,
"SUPERIOR TO THIS?--MARGARET, WE WILL WALK HERE AT LEAST
TWO HOURS."

MARGARET AGREED, AND THEY PURSUED THEIR WAY AGAINST
THE WIND, RESISTING IT WITH LAUGHING DELIGHT FOR ABOUT
TWENTY MINUTES LONGER, WHEN SUDDENLY THE CLOUDS UNITED OVER
THEIR HEADS, AND A DRIVING RAIN SET FULL IN THEIR FACE.--
CHAGRINED AND SURPRISED, THEY WERE OBLIGED, THOUGH UNWILLINGLY,
TO TURN BACK, FOR NO SHELTER WAS NEARER THAN THEIR OWN HOUSE.
ONE CONSOLATION HOWEVER REMAINED FOR THEM, TO WHICH THE
EXIGENCE OF THE MOMENT GAVE MORE THAN USUAL PROPRIETY;
IT WAS THAT OF RUNNING WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED DOWN THE STEEP
SIDE OF THE HILL WHICH LED IMMEDIATELY TO THEIR GARDEN GATE.

THEY SET OFF.  MARIANNE HAD AT FIRST THE ADVANTAGE,
BUT A FALSE STEP BROUGHT HER SUDDENLY TO THE GROUND;
AND MARGARET, UNABLE TO STOP HERSELF TO ASSIST HER,
WAS INVOLUNTARILY HURRIED ALONG, AND REACHED THE BOTTOM
IN SAFETY.

A GENTLEMAN CARRYING A GUN, WITH TWO POINTERS
PLAYING ROUND HIM, WAS PASSING UP THE HILL AND WITHIN
A FEW YARDS OF MARIANNE, WHEN HER ACCIDENT HAPPENED.
HE PUT DOWN HIS GUN AND RAN TO HER ASSISTANCE.  SHE HAD
RAISED HERSELF FROM THE GROUND, BUT HER FOOT HAD BEEN
TWISTED IN HER FALL, AND SHE WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO STAND.
THE GENTLEMAN OFFERED HIS SERVICES; AND PERCEIVING THAT HER
MODESTY DECLINED WHAT HER SITUATION RENDERED NECESSARY,
TOOK HER UP IN HIS ARMS WITHOUT FARTHER DELAY, AND CARRIED
HER DOWN THE HILL.  THEN PASSING THROUGH THE GARDEN,
THE GATE OF WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN BY MARGARET, HE BORE HER
DIRECTLY INTO THE HOUSE, WHITHER MARGARET WAS JUST ARRIVED,
AND QUITTED NOT HIS HOLD TILL HE HAD SEATED HER IN A CHAIR
IN THE PARLOUR.

ELINOR AND HER MOTHER ROSE UP IN AMAZEMENT AT
THEIR ENTRANCE, AND WHILE THE EYES OF BOTH WERE FIXED
ON HIM WITH AN EVIDENT WONDER AND A SECRET ADMIRATION
WHICH EQUALLY SPRUNG FROM HIS APPEARANCE, HE APOLOGIZED
FOR HIS INTRUSION BY RELATING ITS CAUSE, IN A MANNER
SO FRANK AND SO GRACEFUL THAT HIS PERSON, WHICH WAS
UNCOMMONLY HANDSOME, RECEIVED ADDITIONAL CHARMS FROM HIS VOICE
AND EXPRESSION.  HAD HE BEEN EVEN OLD, UGLY, AND VULGAR,
THE GRATITUDE AND KINDNESS OF MRS. DASHWOOD WOULD
HAVE BEEN SECURED BY ANY ACT OF ATTENTION TO HER CHILD;
BUT THE INFLUENCE OF YOUTH, BEAUTY, AND ELEGANCE,
GAVE AN INTEREST TO THE ACTION WHICH CAME HOME TO HER FEELINGS.

SHE THANKED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN; AND, WITH A SWEETNESS
OF ADDRESS WHICH ALWAYS ATTENDED HER, INVITED HIM TO
BE SEATED.  BUT THIS HE DECLINED, AS HE WAS DIRTY AND WET.
MRS. DASHWOOD THEN BEGGED TO KNOW TO WHOM SHE WAS OBLIGED.
HIS NAME, HE REPLIED, WAS WILLOUGHBY, AND HIS PRESENT
HOME WAS AT ALLENHAM, FROM WHENCE HE HOPED SHE WOULD
ALLOW HIM THE HONOUR OF CALLING TOMORROW TO ENQUIRE
AFTER MISS DASHWOOD.  THE HONOUR WAS READILY GRANTED,
AND HE THEN DEPARTED, TO MAKE HIMSELF STILL MORE INTERESTING,
IN THE MIDST OF A HEAVY RAIN.

HIS MANLY BEAUTY AND MORE THAN COMMON GRACEFULNESS
WERE INSTANTLY THE THEME OF GENERAL ADMIRATION,
AND THE LAUGH WHICH HIS GALLANTRY RAISED AGAINST MARIANNE
RECEIVED PARTICULAR SPIRIT FROM HIS EXTERIOR ATTRACTIONS.--
MARIANNE HERSELF HAD SEEN LESS OF HIS PERSON THAT THE REST,
FOR THE CONFUSION WHICH CRIMSONED OVER HER FACE, ON HIS
LIFTING HER UP, HAD ROBBED HER OF THE POWER OF REGARDING
HIM AFTER THEIR ENTERING THE HOUSE.  BUT SHE HAD SEEN
ENOUGH OF HIM TO JOIN IN ALL THE ADMIRATION OF THE OTHERS,
AND WITH AN ENERGY WHICH ALWAYS ADORNED HER PRAISE.
HIS PERSON AND AIR WERE EQUAL TO WHAT HER FANCY HAD EVER
DRAWN FOR THE HERO OF A FAVOURITE STORY; AND IN HIS CARRYING
HER INTO THE HOUSE WITH SO LITTLE PREVIOUS FORMALITY, THERE
WAS A RAPIDITY OF THOUGHT WHICH PARTICULARLY RECOMMENDED
THE ACTION TO HER.  EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE BELONGING TO HIM
WAS INTERESTING.  HIS NAME WAS GOOD, HIS RESIDENCE WAS IN
THEIR FAVOURITE VILLAGE, AND SHE SOON FOUND OUT THAT OF ALL
MANLY DRESSES A SHOOTING-JACKET WAS THE MOST BECOMING.
HER IMAGINATION WAS BUSY, HER REFLECTIONS WERE PLEASANT,
AND THE PAIN OF A SPRAINED ANKLE WAS DISREGARDED.

SIR JOHN CALLED ON THEM AS SOON AS THE NEXT INTERVAL
OF FAIR WEATHER THAT MORNING ALLOWED HIM TO GET OUT
OF DOORS; AND MARIANNE'S ACCIDENT BEING RELATED TO HIM,
HE WAS EAGERLY ASKED WHETHER HE KNEW ANY GENTLEMAN
OF THE NAME OF WILLOUGHBY AT ALLENHAM.

"WILLOUGHBY!" CRIED SIR JOHN; "WHAT, IS HE
IN THE COUNTRY? THAT IS GOOD NEWS HOWEVER; I WILL
RIDE OVER TOMORROW, AND ASK HIM TO DINNER ON THURSDAY."

"YOU KNOW HIM THEN," SAID MRS. DASHWOOD.

"KNOW HIM! TO BE SURE I DO.  WHY, HE IS DOWN HERE
EVERY YEAR."

"AND WHAT SORT OF A YOUNG MAN IS HE?"

"AS GOOD A KIND OF FELLOW AS EVER LIVED, I ASSURE YOU.
A VERY DECENT SHOT, AND THERE IS NOT A BOLDER RIDER
IN ENGLAND."

"AND IS THAT ALL YOU CAN SAY FOR HIM?" CRIED MARIANNE,
INDIGNANTLY.  "BUT WHAT ARE HIS MANNERS ON MORE INTIMATE
ACQUAINTANCE? WHAT HIS PURSUITS, HIS TALENTS, AND GENIUS?"

SIR JOHN WAS RATHER PUZZLED.

"UPON MY SOUL," SAID HE, "I DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM
AS TO ALL THAT.  BUT HE IS A PLEASANT, GOOD HUMOURED FELLOW,
AND HAS GOT THE NICEST LITTLE BLACK BITCH OF A POINTER
I EVER SAW.  WAS SHE OUT WITH HIM TODAY?"

BUT MARIANNE COULD NO MORE SATISFY HIM AS TO THE
COLOUR OF MR. WILLOUGHBY'S POINTER, THAN HE COULD
DESCRIBE TO HER THE SHADES OF HIS MIND.

"BUT WHO IS HE?" SAID ELINOR.  "WHERE DOES HE COME
FROM?  HAS HE A HOUSE AT ALLENHAM?"

ON THIS POINT SIR JOHN COULD GIVE MORE CERTAIN INTELLIGENCE;
AND HE TOLD THEM THAT MR. WILLOUGHBY HAD NO PROPERTY
OF HIS OWN IN THE COUNTRY; THAT HE RESIDED THERE ONLY
WHILE HE WAS VISITING THE OLD LADY AT ALLENHAM COURT,
TO WHOM HE WAS RELATED, AND WHOSE POSSESSIONS HE WAS
TO INHERIT; ADDING, "YES, YES, HE IS VERY WELL WORTH
CATCHING I CAN TELL YOU, MISS DASHWOOD; HE HAS A PRETTY
LITTLE ESTATE OF HIS OWN IN SOMERSETSHIRE BESIDES;
AND IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD NOT GIVE HIM UP TO MY
YOUNGER SISTER, IN SPITE OF ALL THIS TUMBLING DOWN HILLS.
MISS MARIANNE MUST NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ALL THE MEN TO HERSELF.
BRANDON WILL BE JEALOUS, IF SHE DOES NOT TAKE CARE."

"I DO NOT BELIEVE," SAID MRS. DASHWOOD, WITH A
GOOD HUMOURED SMILE, "THAT MR. WILLOUGHBY WILL BE INCOMMODED
BY THE ATTEMPTS OF EITHER OF MY DAUGHTERS TOWARDS WHAT
YOU CALL CATCHING HIM.  IT IS NOT AN EMPLOYMENT TO WHICH
THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP.  MEN ARE VERY SAFE WITH US,
LET THEM BE EVER SO RICH.  I AM GLAD TO FIND, HOWEVER,
FROM WHAT YOU SAY, THAT HE IS A RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN,
AND ONE WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE WILL NOT BE INELIGIBLE."

"HE IS AS GOOD A SORT OF FELLOW, I BELIEVE,
AS EVER LIVED," REPEATED SIR JOHN.  "I REMEMBER
LAST CHRISTMAS AT A LITTLE HOP AT THE PARK, HE DANCED
FROM EIGHT O'CLOCK TILL FOUR, WITHOUT ONCE SITTING DOWN."

"DID HE INDEED?" CRIED MARIANNE WITH SPARKLING EYES,
"AND WITH ELEGANCE, WITH SPIRIT?"

"YES; AND HE WAS UP AGAIN AT EIGHT TO RIDE TO COVERT."

"THAT IS WHAT I LIKE; THAT IS WHAT A YOUNG MAN OUGHT
TO BE.  WHATEVER BE HIS PURSUITS, HIS EAGERNESS IN THEM
SHOULD KNOW NO MODERATION, AND LEAVE HIM NO SENSE OF FATIGUE."

"AYE, AYE, I SEE HOW IT WILL BE," SAID SIR JOHN, "I SEE
HOW IT WILL BE.  YOU WILL BE SETTING YOUR CAP AT HIM NOW,
AND NEVER THINK OF POOR BRANDON."

"THAT IS AN EXPRESSION, SIR JOHN," SAID MARIANNE,
WARMLY, "WHICH I PARTICULARLY DISLIKE.  I ABHOR EVERY
COMMON-PLACE PHRASE BY WHICH WIT IS INTENDED; AND 'SETTING
ONE'S CAP AT A MAN,' OR 'MAKING A CONQUEST,' ARE THE MOST
ODIOUS OF ALL.  THEIR TENDENCY IS GROSS AND ILLIBERAL;
AND IF THEIR CONSTRUCTION COULD EVER BE DEEMED CLEVER,
TIME HAS LONG AGO DESTROYED ALL ITS INGENUITY."

SIR JOHN DID NOT MUCH UNDERSTAND THIS REPROOF;
BUT HE LAUGHED AS HEARTILY AS IF HE DID, AND THEN REPLIED,

"AY, YOU WILL MAKE CONQUESTS ENOUGH, I DARE SAY,
ONE WAY OR OTHER.  POOR BRANDON! HE IS QUITE SMITTEN ALREADY,
AND HE IS VERY WELL WORTH SETTING YOUR CAP AT, I CAN
TELL YOU, IN SPITE OF ALL THIS TUMBLING ABOUT AND SPRAINING
OF ANKLES."



CHAPTER 10


MARIANNE'S PRESERVER, AS MARGARET, WITH MORE ELEGANCE
THAN PRECISION, STYLED WILLOUGHBY, CALLED AT THE COTTAGE
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING TO MAKE HIS PERSONAL ENQUIRIES.
HE WAS RECEIVED BY MRS. DASHWOOD WITH MORE THAN POLITENESS;
WITH A KINDNESS WHICH SIR JOHN'S ACCOUNT OF HIM AND HER OWN
GRATITUDE PROMPTED; AND EVERY THING THAT PASSED DURING
THE VISIT TENDED TO ASSURE HIM OF THE SENSE, ELEGANCE,
MUTUAL AFFECTION, AND DOMESTIC COMFORT OF THE FAMILY
TO WHOM ACCIDENT HAD NOW INTRODUCED HIM.  OF THEIR
PERSONAL CHARMS HE HAD NOT REQUIRED A SECOND INTERVIEW
TO BE CONVINCED.

MISS DASHWOOD HAD A DELICATE COMPLEXION,
REGULAR FEATURES, AND A REMARKABLY PRETTY FIGURE.
MARIANNE WAS STILL HANDSOMER.  HER FORM, THOUGH NOT SO
CORRECT AS HER SISTER'S, IN HAVING THE ADVANTAGE OF HEIGHT,
WAS MORE STRIKING; AND HER FACE WAS SO LOVELY, THAT WHEN
IN THE COMMON CANT OF PRAISE, SHE WAS CALLED A BEAUTIFUL GIRL,
TRUTH WAS LESS VIOLENTLY OUTRAGED THAN USUALLY HAPPENS.
HER SKIN WAS VERY BROWN, BUT, FROM ITS TRANSPARENCY,
HER COMPLEXION WAS UNCOMMONLY BRILLIANT; HER FEATURES
WERE ALL GOOD; HER SMILE WAS SWEET AND ATTRACTIVE;
AND IN HER EYES, WHICH WERE VERY DARK, THERE WAS A LIFE,
A SPIRIT, AN EAGERNESS, WHICH COULD HARDILY BE SEEN
WITHOUT DELIGHT.  FROM WILLOUGHBY THEIR EXPRESSION WAS AT
FIRST HELD BACK, BY THE EMBARRASSMENT WHICH THE REMEMBRANCE
OF HIS ASSISTANCE CREATED.  BUT WHEN THIS PASSED AWAY,
WHEN HER SPIRITS BECAME COLLECTED, WHEN SHE SAW THAT TO THE
PERFECT GOOD-BREEDING OF THE GENTLEMAN, HE UNITED FRANKNESS
AND VIVACITY, AND ABOVE ALL, WHEN SHE HEARD HIM DECLARE,
THAT OF MUSIC AND DANCING HE WAS PASSIONATELY FOND,
SHE GAVE HIM SUCH A LOOK OF APPROBATION AS SECURED THE
LARGEST SHARE OF HIS DISCOURSE TO HERSELF FOR THE REST
OF HIS STAY.

IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO MENTION ANY FAVOURITE
AMUSEMENT TO ENGAGE HER TO TALK.  SHE COULD NOT BE
SILENT WHEN SUCH POINTS WERE INTRODUCED, AND SHE
HAD NEITHER SHYNESS NOR RESERVE IN THEIR DISCUSSION.
THEY SPEEDILY DISCOVERED THAT THEIR ENJOYMENT OF DANCING
AND MUSIC WAS MUTUAL, AND THAT IT AROSE FROM A GENERAL
CONFORMITY OF JUDGMENT IN ALL THAT RELATED TO EITHER.
ENCOURAGED BY THIS TO A FURTHER EXAMINATION OF HIS OPINIONS,
SHE PROCEEDED TO QUESTION HIM ON THE SUBJECT OF BOOKS;
HER FAVOURITE AUTHORS WERE BROUGHT FORWARD AND DWELT
UPON WITH SO RAPTUROUS A DELIGHT, THAT ANY YOUNG MAN OF
FIVE AND TWENTY MUST HAVE BEEN INSENSIBLE INDEED, NOT TO
BECOME AN IMMEDIATE CONVERT TO THE EXCELLENCE OF SUCH WORKS,
HOWEVER DISREGARDED BEFORE.  THEIR TASTE WAS STRIKINGLY ALIKE.
THE SAME BOOKS, THE SAME PASSAGES WERE IDOLIZED BY EACH--
OR IF ANY DIFFERENCE APPEARED, ANY OBJECTION AROSE,
IT LASTED NO LONGER THAN TILL THE FORCE OF HER ARGUMENTS
AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER EYES COULD BE DISPLAYED.
HE ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER DECISIONS, CAUGHT ALL HER ENTHUSIASM;
AND LONG BEFORE HIS VISIT CONCLUDED, THEY CONVERSED
WITH THE FAMILIARITY OF A LONG-ESTABLISHED ACQUAINTANCE.

"WELL, MARIANNE," SAID ELINOR, AS SOON AS HE HAD LEFT THEM,
"FOR ONE MORNING I THINK YOU HAVE DONE PRETTY WELL.
YOU HAVE ALREADY ASCERTAINED MR. WILLOUGHBY'S OPINION IN
ALMOST EVERY MATTER OF IMPORTANCE.  YOU KNOW WHAT HE THINKS
OF COWPER AND SCOTT; YOU ARE CERTAIN OF HIS ESTIMATING
THEIR BEAUTIES AS HE OUGHT, AND YOU HAVE RECEIVED EVERY
ASSURANCE OF HIS ADMIRING POPE NO MORE THAN IS PROPER.
BUT HOW IS YOUR ACQUAINTANCE TO BE LONG SUPPORTED, UNDER SUCH
EXTRAORDINARY DESPATCH OF EVERY SUBJECT FOR DISCOURSE?
YOU WILL SOON HAVE EXHAUSTED EACH FAVOURITE TOPIC.
ANOTHER MEETING WILL SUFFICE TO EXPLAIN HIS SENTIMENTS
ON PICTURESQUE BEAUTY, AND SECOND MARRIAGES, AND THEN
YOU CAN HAVE NOTHING FARTHER TO ASK."--

"ELINOR," CRIED MARIANNE, "IS THIS FAIR? IS THIS
JUST? ARE MY IDEAS SO SCANTY?  BUT I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.
I HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH AT MY EASE, TOO HAPPY, TOO FRANK.
I HAVE ERRED AGAINST EVERY COMMON-PLACE NOTION OF DECORUM;
I HAVE BEEN OPEN AND SINCERE WHERE I OUGHT TO HAVE
BEEN RESERVED, SPIRITLESS, DULL, AND DECEITFUL--HAD
I TALKED ONLY OF THE WEATHER AND THE ROADS, AND HAD I
SPOKEN ONLY ONCE IN TEN MINUTES, THIS REPROACH WOULD HAVE
BEEN SPARED."

"MY LOVE," SAID HER MOTHER, "YOU MUST NOT BE OFFENDED
WITH ELINOR--SHE WAS ONLY IN JEST.  I SHOULD SCOLD
HER MYSELF, IF SHE WERE CAPABLE OF WISHING TO CHECK
THE DELIGHT OF YOUR CONVERSATION WITH OUR NEW FRIEND."--
MARIANNE WAS SOFTENED IN A MOMENT.

WILLOUGHBY, ON HIS SIDE, GAVE EVERY PROOF OF HIS
PLEASURE IN THEIR ACQUAINTANCE, WHICH AN EVIDENT WISH
OF IMPROVING IT COULD OFFER.  HE CAME TO THEM EVERY DAY.
TO ENQUIRE AFTER MARIANNE WAS AT FIRST HIS EXCUSE; BUT THE
ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS RECEPTION, TO WHICH EVERY DAY GAVE
GREATER KINDNESS, MADE SUCH AN EXCUSE UNNECESSARY BEFORE IT
HAD CEASED TO BE POSSIBLE, BY MARIANNE'S PERFECT RECOVERY.
SHE WAS CONFINED FOR SOME DAYS TO THE HOUSE; BUT NEVER HAD
ANY CONFINEMENT BEEN LESS IRKSOME.  WILLOUGHBY WAS A YOUNG
MAN OF GOOD ABILITIES, QUICK IMAGINATION, LIVELY SPIRITS,
AND OPEN, AFFECTIONATE MANNERS.  HE WAS EXACTLY FORMED
TO ENGAGE MARIANNE'S HEART, FOR WITH ALL THIS, HE JOINED
NOT ONLY A CAPTIVATING PERSON, BUT A NATURAL ARDOUR
OF MIND WHICH WAS NOW ROUSED AND INCREASED BY THE EXAMPLE
OF HER OWN, AND WHICH RECOMMENDED HIM TO HER AFFECTION
BEYOND EVERY THING ELSE.

HIS SOCIETY BECAME GRADUALLY HER MOST EXQUISITE ENJOYMENT.
THEY READ, THEY TALKED, THEY SANG TOGETHER; HIS MUSICAL
TALENTS WERE CONSIDERABLE; AND HE READ WITH ALL THE
SENSIBILITY AND SPIRIT WHICH EDWARD HAD UNFORTUNATELY WANTED.

IN MRS. DASHWOOD'S ESTIMATION HE WAS AS FAULTLESS
AS IN MARIANNE'S; AND ELINOR SAW NOTHING TO CENSURE IN HIM
BUT A PROPENSITY, IN WHICH HE STRONGLY RESEMBLED AND PECULIARLY
DELIGHTED HER SISTER, OF SAYING TOO MUCH WHAT HE THOUGHT ON
EVERY OCCASION, WITHOUT ATTENTION TO PERSONS OR CIRCUMSTANCES.
IN HASTILY FORMING AND GIVING HIS OPINION OF OTHER PEOPLE,
IN SACRIFICING GENERAL POLITENESS TO THE ENJOYMENT
OF UNDIVIDED ATTENTION WHERE HIS HEART WAS ENGAGED,
AND IN SLIGHTING TOO EASILY THE FORMS OF WORLDLY PROPRIETY,
HE DISPLAYED A WANT OF CAUTION WHICH ELINOR COULD NOT APPROVE,
IN SPITE OF ALL THAT HE AND MARIANNE COULD SAY IN ITS SUPPORT.

MARIANNE BEGAN NOW TO PERCEIVE THAT THE DESPERATION
WHICH HAD SEIZED HER AT SIXTEEN AND A HALF, OF EVER
SEEING A MAN WHO COULD SATISFY HER IDEAS OF PERFECTION,
HAD BEEN RASH AND UNJUSTIFIABLE.  WILLOUGHBY WAS ALL
THAT HER FANCY HAD DELINEATED IN THAT UNHAPPY HOUR
AND IN EVERY BRIGHTER PERIOD, AS CAPABLE OF ATTACHING HER;
AND HIS BEHAVIOUR DECLARED HIS WISHES TO BE IN THAT RESPECT
AS EARNEST, AS HIS ABILITIES WERE STRONG.

HER MOTHER TOO, IN WHOSE MIND NOT ONE SPECULATIVE
THOUGHT OF THEIR MARRIAGE HAD BEEN RAISED, BY HIS PROSPECT
OF RICHES, WAS LED BEFORE THE END OF A WEEK TO HOPE AND
EXPECT IT; AND SECRETLY TO CONGRATULATE HERSELF ON HAVING
GAINED TWO SUCH SONS-IN-LAW AS EDWARD AND WILLOUGHBY.

COLONEL BRANDON'S PARTIALITY FOR MARIANNE, WHICH HAD
SO EARLY BEEN DISCOVERED BY HIS FRIENDS, NOW FIRST BECAME
PERCEPTIBLE TO ELINOR, WHEN IT CEASED TO BE NOTICED
BY THEM.  THEIR ATTENTION AND WIT WERE DRAWN OFF TO HIS
MORE FORTUNATE RIVAL; AND THE RAILLERY WHICH THE OTHER
HAD INCURRED BEFORE ANY PARTIALITY AROSE, WAS REMOVED
WHEN HIS FEELINGS BEGAN REALLY TO CALL FOR THE RIDICULE
SO JUSTLY ANNEXED TO SENSIBILITY.  ELINOR WAS OBLIGED,
THOUGH UNWILLINGLY, TO BELIEVE THAT THE SENTIMENTS WHICH
MRS. JENNINGS HAD ASSIGNED HIM FOR HER OWN SATISFACTION,
WERE NOW ACTUALLY EXCITED BY HER SISTER; AND THAT HOWEVER
A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE OF DISPOSITION BETWEEN THE PARTIES
MIGHT FORWARD THE AFFECTION OF MR. WILLOUGHBY, AN EQUALLY
STRIKING OPPOSITION OF CHARACTER WAS NO HINDRANCE TO THE
REGARD OF COLONEL BRANDON.  SHE SAW IT WITH CONCERN;
FOR WHAT COULD A SILENT MAN OF FIVE AND THIRTY HOPE,
WHEN OPPOSED TO A VERY LIVELY ONE OF FIVE AND TWENTY? AND AS
SHE COULD NOT EVEN WISH HIM SUCCESSFUL, SHE HEARTILY WISHED
HIM INDIFFERENT.  SHE LIKED HIM--IN SPITE OF HIS GRAVITY
AND RESERVE, SHE BEHELD IN HIM AN OBJECT OF INTEREST.
HIS MANNERS, THOUGH SERIOUS, WERE MILD; AND HIS RESERVE
APPEARED RATHER THE RESULT OF SOME OPPRESSION OF SPIRITS
THAN OF ANY NATURAL GLOOMINESS OF TEMPER.  SIR JOHN
HAD DROPPED HINTS OF PAST INJURIES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS,
WHICH JUSTIFIED HER BELIEF OF HIS BEING AN UNFORTUNATE MAN,
AND SHE REGARDED HIM WITH RESPECT AND COMPASSION.

PERHAPS SHE PITIED AND ESTEEMED HIM THE MORE
BECAUSE HE WAS SLIGHTED BY WILLOUGHBY AND MARIANNE,
WHO, PREJUDICED AGAINST HIM FOR BEING NEITHER LIVELY
NOR YOUNG, SEEMED RESOLVED TO UNDERVALUE HIS MERITS.

"BRANDON IS JUST THE KIND OF MAN," SAID WILLOUGHBY
ONE DAY, WHEN THEY WERE TALKING OF HIM TOGETHER,
"WHOM EVERY BODY SPEAKS WELL OF, AND NOBODY CARES ABOUT;
WHOM ALL ARE DELIGHTED TO SEE, AND NOBODY REMEMBERS
TO TALK TO."

"THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I THINK OF HIM," CRIED MARIANNE.

"DO NOT BOAST OF IT, HOWEVER," SAID ELINOR, "FOR IT
IS INJUSTICE IN BOTH OF YOU.  HE IS HIGHLY ESTEEMED
BY ALL THE FAMILY AT THE PARK, AND I NEVER SEE HIM MYSELF
WITHOUT TAKING PAINS TO CONVERSE WITH HIM."

"THAT HE IS PATRONISED BY YOU," REPLIED WILLOUGHBY,
"IS CERTAINLY IN HIS FAVOUR; BUT AS FOR THE ESTEEM
OF THE OTHERS, IT IS A REPROACH IN ITSELF.  WHO WOULD
SUBMIT TO THE INDIGNITY OF BEING APPROVED BY SUCH A WOMAN
AS LADY MIDDLETON AND MRS. JENNINGS, THAT COULD COMMAND
THE INDIFFERENCE OF ANY BODY ELSE?"

"BUT PERHAPS THE ABUSE OF SUCH PEOPLE AS YOURSELF
AND MARIANNE WILL MAKE AMENDS FOR THE REGARD OF LADY
MIDDLETON AND HER MOTHER.  IF THEIR PRAISE IS CENSURE,
YOUR CENSURE MAY BE PRAISE, FOR THEY ARE NOT MORE UNDISCERNING,
THAN YOU ARE PREJUDICED AND UNJUST."

"IN DEFENCE OF YOUR PROTEGE YOU CAN EVEN BE SAUCY."

"MY PROTEGE, AS YOU CALL HIM, IS A SENSIBLE MAN;
AND SENSE WILL ALWAYS HAVE ATTRACTIONS FOR ME.
YES, MARIANNE, EVEN IN A MAN BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY.
HE HAS SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF THE WORLD; HAS BEEN ABROAD,
HAS READ, AND HAS A THINKING MIND.  I HAVE FOUND HIM
CAPABLE OF GIVING ME MUCH INFORMATION ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS;
AND HE HAS ALWAYS ANSWERED MY INQUIRIES WITH READINESS OF
GOOD-BREEDING AND GOOD NATURE."

"THAT IS TO SAY," CRIED MARIANNE CONTEMPTUOUSLY,
"HE HAS TOLD YOU, THAT IN THE EAST INDIES THE CLIMATE IS HOT,
AND THE MOSQUITOES ARE TROUBLESOME."

"HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME SO, I DOUBT NOT, HAD I MADE
ANY SUCH INQUIRIES, BUT THEY HAPPENED TO BE POINTS
ON WHICH I HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY INFORMED."

"PERHAPS," SAID WILLOUGHBY, "HIS OBSERVATIONS MAY
HAVE EXTENDED TO THE EXISTENCE OF NABOBS, GOLD MOHRS,
AND PALANQUINS."

"I MAY VENTURE TO SAY THAT HIS OBSERVATIONS
HAVE STRETCHED MUCH FURTHER THAN YOUR CANDOUR.
BUT WHY SHOULD YOU DISLIKE HIM?"

"I DO NOT DISLIKE HIM.  I CONSIDER HIM, ON THE CONTRARY,
AS A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN, WHO HAS EVERY BODY'S GOOD WORD,
AND NOBODY'S NOTICE; WHO, HAS MORE MONEY THAN HE CAN SPEND,
MORE TIME THAN HE KNOWS HOW TO EMPLOY, AND TWO NEW COATS
EVERY YEAR."

"ADD TO WHICH," CRIED MARIANNE, "THAT HE HAS
NEITHER GENIUS, TASTE, NOR SPIRIT.  THAT HIS UNDERSTANDING
HAS NO BRILLIANCY, HIS FEELINGS NO ARDOUR, AND HIS VOICE
NO EXPRESSION."

"YOU DECIDE ON HIS IMPERFECTIONS SO MUCH IN THE MASS,"
REPLIED ELINOR, "AND SO MUCH ON THE STRENGTH OF YOUR
OWN IMAGINATION, THAT THE COMMENDATION I AM ABLE TO GIVE
OF HIM IS COMPARATIVELY COLD AND INSIPID.  I CAN ONLY
PRONOUNCE HIM TO BE A SENSIBLE MAN, WELL-BRED, WELL-INFORMED,
OF GENTLE ADDRESS, AND, I BELIEVE, POSSESSING AN AMIABLE HEART."

"MISS DASHWOOD," CRIED WILLOUGHBY, "YOU ARE NOW USING
ME UNKINDLY.  YOU ARE ENDEAVOURING TO DISARM ME BY REASON,
AND TO CONVINCE ME AGAINST MY WILL.  BUT IT WILL NOT DO.
YOU SHALL FIND ME AS STUBBORN AS YOU CAN BE ARTFUL.  I HAVE
THREE UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR DISLIKING COLONEL BRANDON;
HE THREATENED ME WITH RAIN WHEN I WANTED IT TO BE FINE;
HE HAS FOUND FAULT WITH THE HANGING OF MY CURRICLE,
AND I CANNOT PERSUADE HIM TO BUY MY BROWN MARE.  IF IT
WILL BE ANY SATISFACTION TO YOU, HOWEVER, TO BE TOLD,
THAT I BELIEVE HIS CHARACTER TO BE IN OTHER RESPECTS
IRREPROACHABLE, I AM READY TO CONFESS IT.  AND IN RETURN
FOR AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT, WHICH MUST GIVE ME SOME PAIN,
YOU CANNOT DENY ME THE PRIVILEGE OF DISLIKING HIM AS MUCH
AS EVER."



CHAPTER 11


LITTLE HAD MRS. DASHWOOD OR HER DAUGHTERS IMAGINED
WHEN THEY FIRST CAME INTO DEVONSHIRE, THAT SO MANY
ENGAGEMENTS WOULD ARISE TO OCCUPY THEIR TIME AS SHORTLY
PRESENTED THEMSELVES, OR THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SUCH FREQUENT
INVITATIONS AND SUCH CONSTANT VISITORS AS TO LEAVE THEM LITTLE
LEISURE FOR SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT.  YET SUCH WAS THE CASE.
WHEN MARIANNE WAS RECOVERED, THE SCHEMES OF AMUSEMENT AT HOME
AND ABROAD, WHICH SIR JOHN HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY FORMING,
WERE PUT INTO EXECUTION.  THE PRIVATE BALLS AT THE PARK
THEN BEGAN; AND PARTIES ON THE WATER WERE MADE AND
ACCOMPLISHED AS OFTEN AS A SHOWERY OCTOBER WOULD ALLOW.
IN EVERY MEETING OF THE KIND WILLOUGHBY WAS INCLUDED;
AND THE EASE AND FAMILIARITY WHICH NATURALLY ATTENDED
THESE PARTIES WERE EXACTLY CALCULATED TO GIVE INCREASING
INTIMACY TO HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE DASHWOODS, TO AFFORD
HIM OPPORTUNITY OF WITNESSING THE EXCELLENCIES OF MARIANNE,
OF MARKING HIS ANIMATED ADMIRATION OF HER, AND OF RECEIVING,
IN HER BEHAVIOUR TO HIMSELF, THE MOST POINTED ASSURANCE
OF HER AFFECTION.

ELINOR COULD NOT BE SURPRISED AT THEIR ATTACHMENT.
SHE ONLY WISHED THAT IT WERE LESS OPENLY SHEWN; AND ONCE
OR TWICE DID VENTURE TO SUGGEST THE PROPRIETY OF SOME
SELF-COMMAND TO MARIANNE.  BUT MARIANNE ABHORRED ALL
CONCEALMENT WHERE NO REAL DISGRACE COULD ATTEND UNRESERVE;
AND TO AIM AT THE RESTRAINT OF SENTIMENTS WHICH WERE NOT
IN THEMSELVES ILLAUDABLE, APPEARED TO HER NOT MERELY
AN UNNECESSARY EFFORT, BUT A DISGRACEFUL SUBJECTION
OF REASON TO COMMON-PLACE AND MISTAKEN NOTIONS.
WILLOUGHBY THOUGHT THE SAME; AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR AT
ALL TIMES, WAS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THEIR OPINIONS.

WHEN HE WAS PRESENT SHE HAD NO EYES FOR ANY ONE ELSE.
EVERY THING HE DID, WAS RIGHT.  EVERY THING HE SAID, WAS CLEVER.
IF THEIR EVENINGS AT THE PARK WERE CONCLUDED WITH CARDS,
HE CHEATED HIMSELF AND ALL THE REST OF THE PARTY TO GET
HER A GOOD HAND.  IF DANCING FORMED THE AMUSEMENT
OF THE NIGHT, THEY WERE PARTNERS FOR HALF THE TIME;
AND WHEN OBLIGED TO SEPARATE FOR A COUPLE OF DANCES,
WERE CAREFUL TO STAND TOGETHER AND SCARCELY SPOKE A WORD
TO ANY BODY ELSE.  SUCH CONDUCT MADE THEM OF COURSE
MOST EXCEEDINGLY LAUGHED AT; BUT RIDICULE COULD NOT SHAME,
AND SEEMED HARDLY TO PROVOKE THEM.

MRS. DASHWOOD ENTERED INTO ALL THEIR FEELINGS WITH
A WARMTH WHICH LEFT HER NO INCLINATION FOR CHECKING THIS
EXCESSIVE DISPLAY OF THEM.  TO HER IT WAS BUT THE NATURAL
CONSEQUENCE OF A STRONG AFFECTION IN A YOUNG AND ARDENT MIND.

THIS WAS THE SEASON OF HAPPINESS TO MARIANNE.
HER HEART WAS DEVOTED TO WILLOUGHBY, AND THE FOND ATTACHMENT
TO NORLAND, WHICH SHE BROUGHT WITH HER FROM SUSSEX,
WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE SOFTENED THAN SHE HAD THOUGHT IT
POSSIBLE BEFORE, BY THE CHARMS WHICH HIS SOCIETY BESTOWED
ON HER PRESENT HOME.

ELINOR'S HAPPINESS WAS NOT SO GREAT.  HER HEART WAS NOT
SO MUCH AT EASE, NOR HER SATISFACTION IN THEIR AMUSEMENTS
SO PURE.  THEY AFFORDED HER NO COMPANION THAT COULD MAKE
AMENDS FOR WHAT SHE HAD LEFT BEHIND, NOR THAT COULD TEACH
HER TO THINK OF NORLAND WITH LESS REGRET THAN EVER.
NEITHER LADY MIDDLETON NOR MRS. JENNINGS COULD SUPPLY
TO HER THE CONVERSATION SHE MISSED; ALTHOUGH THE LATTER
WAS AN EVERLASTING TALKER, AND FROM THE FIRST HAD REGARDED
HER WITH A KINDNESS WHICH ENSURED HER A LARGE SHARE OF
HER DISCOURSE.  SHE HAD ALREADY REPEATED HER OWN HISTORY
TO ELINOR THREE OR FOUR TIMES; AND HAD ELINOR'S MEMORY BEEN
EQUAL TO HER MEANS OF IMPROVEMENT, SHE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
VERY EARLY IN THEIR ACQUAINTANCE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF
MR. JENNING'S LAST ILLNESS, AND WHAT HE SAID TO HIS WIFE
A FEW MINUTES BEFORE HE DIED.  LADY MIDDLETON WAS MORE
AGREEABLE THAN HER MOTHER ONLY IN BEING MORE SILENT.
ELINOR NEEDED LITTLE OBSERVATION TO PERCEIVE THAT HER
RESERVE WAS A MERE CALMNESS OF MANNER WITH WHICH SENSE
HAD NOTHING TO DO.  TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND MOTHER SHE
WAS THE SAME AS TO THEM; AND INTIMACY WAS THEREFORE
NEITHER TO BE LOOKED FOR NOR DESIRED.  SHE HAD NOTHING
TO SAY ONE DAY THAT SHE HAD NOT SAID THE DAY BEFORE.
HER INSIPIDITY WAS INVARIABLE, FOR EVEN HER SPIRITS WERE
ALWAYS THE SAME; AND THOUGH SHE DID NOT OPPOSE THE PARTIES
ARRANGED BY HER HUSBAND, PROVIDED EVERY THING WERE CONDUCTED
IN STYLE AND HER TWO ELDEST CHILDREN ATTENDED HER,
SHE NEVER APPEARED TO RECEIVE MORE ENJOYMENT FROM THEM
THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED IN SITTING AT HOME;--
AND SO LITTLE DID HER PRESENCE ADD TO THE PLEASURE
OF THE OTHERS, BY ANY SHARE IN THEIR CONVERSATION,
THAT THEY WERE SOMETIMES ONLY REMINDED OF HER BEING
AMONGST THEM BY HER SOLICITUDE ABOUT HER TROUBLESOME BOYS.

IN COLONEL BRANDON ALONE, OF ALL HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE,
DID ELINOR FIND A PERSON WHO COULD IN ANY DEGREE CLAIM THE
RESPECT OF ABILITIES, EXCITE THE INTEREST OF FRIENDSHIP,
OR GIVE PLEASURE AS A COMPANION.  WILLOUGHBY WAS OUT
OF THE QUESTION.  HER ADMIRATION AND REGARD, EVEN HER
SISTERLY REGARD, WAS ALL HIS OWN; BUT HE WAS A LOVER;
HIS ATTENTIONS WERE WHOLLY MARIANNE'S, AND A FAR LESS
AGREEABLE MAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE GENERALLY PLEASING.
COLONEL BRANDON, UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF, HAD NO SUCH
ENCOURAGEMENT TO THINK ONLY OF MARIANNE, AND IN CONVERSING
WITH ELINOR HE FOUND THE GREATEST CONSOLATION FOR THE
INDIFFERENCE OF HER SISTER.

ELINOR'S COMPASSION FOR HIM INCREASED, AS SHE HAD REASON
TO SUSPECT THAT THE MISERY OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE HAD ALREADY
BEEN KNOWN TO HIM.  THIS SUSPICION WAS GIVEN BY SOME WORDS
WHICH ACCIDENTLY DROPPED FROM HIM ONE EVENING AT THE PARK,
WHEN THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TOGETHER BY MUTUAL CONSENT,
WHILE THE OTHERS WERE DANCING.  HIS EYES WERE FIXED
ON MARIANNE, AND, AFTER A SILENCE OF SOME MINUTES,
HE SAID, WITH A FAINT SMILE, "YOUR SISTER, I UNDERSTAND,
DOES NOT APPROVE OF SECOND ATTACHMENTS."

"NO," REPLIED ELINOR, "HER OPINIONS ARE ALL ROMANTIC."

"OR RATHER, AS I BELIEVE, SHE CONSIDERS THEM
IMPOSSIBLE TO EXIST."

"I BELIEVE SHE DOES.  BUT HOW SHE CONTRIVES IT
WITHOUT REFLECTING ON THE CHARACTER OF HER OWN FATHER,
WHO HAD HIMSELF TWO WIVES, I KNOW NOT.  A FEW YEARS
HOWEVER WILL SETTLE HER OPINIONS ON THE REASONABLE BASIS
OF COMMON SENSE AND OBSERVATION; AND THEN THEY MAY BE
MORE EASY TO DEFINE AND TO JUSTIFY THAN THEY NOW ARE,
BY ANY BODY BUT HERSELF."

"THIS WILL PROBABLY BE THE CASE," HE REPLIED;
"AND YET THERE IS SOMETHING SO AMIABLE IN THE PREJUDICES
OF A YOUNG MIND, THAT ONE IS SORRY TO SEE THEM GIVE WAY
TO THE RECEPTION OF MORE GENERAL OPINIONS."

"I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU THERE," SAID ELINOR.
"THERE ARE INCONVENIENCES ATTENDING SUCH FEELINGS
AS MARIANNE'S, WHICH ALL THE CHARMS OF ENTHUSIASM AND
IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD CANNOT ATONE FOR.  HER SYSTEMS HAVE
ALL THE UNFORTUNATE TENDENCY OF SETTING PROPRIETY AT NOUGHT;
AND A BETTER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE WORLD IS WHAT I LOOK
FORWARD TO AS HER GREATEST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE."

AFTER A SHORT PAUSE HE RESUMED THE CONVERSATION
BY SAYING,--

"DOES YOUR SISTER MAKE NO DISTINCTION IN HER OBJECTIONS
AGAINST A SECOND ATTACHMENT? OR IS IT EQUALLY CRIMINAL
IN EVERY BODY?  ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED
IN THEIR FIRST CHOICE, WHETHER FROM THE INCONSTANCY
OF ITS OBJECT, OR THE PERVERSENESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES,
TO BE EQUALLY INDIFFERENT DURING THE REST OF THEIR LIVES?"

"UPON MY WORD, I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE MINUTIAE
OF HER PRINCIPLES.  I ONLY KNOW THAT I NEVER YET HEARD HER
ADMIT ANY INSTANCE OF A SECOND ATTACHMENT'S BEING PARDONABLE."

"THIS," SAID HE, "CANNOT HOLD; BUT A CHANGE,
A TOTAL CHANGE OF SENTIMENTS--NO, NO, DO NOT DESIRE IT;
FOR WHEN THE ROMANTIC REFINEMENTS OF A YOUNG MIND
ARE OBLIGED TO GIVE WAY, HOW FREQUENTLY ARE THEY
SUCCEEDED BY SUCH OPINIONS AS ARE BUT TOO COMMON, AND TOO
DANGEROUS!  I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE.  I ONCE KNEW A LADY
WHO IN TEMPER AND MIND GREATLY RESEMBLED YOUR SISTER,
WHO THOUGHT AND JUDGED LIKE HER, BUT WHO FROM AN INFORCED
CHANGE--FROM A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES"--
HERE HE STOPT SUDDENLY; APPEARED TO THINK THAT HE HAD SAID
TOO MUCH, AND BY HIS COUNTENANCE GAVE RISE TO CONJECTURES,
WHICH MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE ENTERED ELINOR'S HEAD.
THE LADY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE PASSED WITHOUT SUSPICION,
HAD HE NOT CONVINCED MISS DASHWOOD THAT WHAT CONCERNED
HER OUGHT NOT TO ESCAPE HIS LIPS.  AS IT WAS,
IT REQUIRED BUT A SLIGHT EFFORT OF FANCY TO CONNECT HIS
EMOTION WITH THE TENDER RECOLLECTION OF PAST REGARD.
ELINOR ATTEMPTED NO MORE.  BUT MARIANNE, IN HER PLACE,
WOULD NOT HAVE DONE SO LITTLE.  THE WHOLE STORY WOULD
HAVE BEEN SPEEDILY FORMED UNDER HER ACTIVE IMAGINATION;
AND EVERY THING ESTABLISHED IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY ORDER
OF DISASTROUS LOVE.



CHAPTER 12


AS ELINOR AND MARIANNE WERE WALKING TOGETHER THE
NEXT MORNING THE LATTER COMMUNICATED A PIECE OF NEWS
TO HER SISTER, WHICH IN SPITE OF ALL THAT SHE KNEW
BEFORE OF MARIANNE'S IMPRUDENCE AND WANT OF THOUGHT,
SURPRISED HER BY ITS EXTRAVAGANT TESTIMONY OF BOTH.
MARIANNE TOLD HER, WITH THE GREATEST DELIGHT, THAT
WILLOUGHBY HAD GIVEN HER A HORSE, ONE THAT HE HAD BRED
HIMSELF ON HIS ESTATE IN SOMERSETSHIRE, AND WHICH WAS
EXACTLY CALCULATED TO CARRY A WOMAN.  WITHOUT CONSIDERING
THAT IT WAS NOT IN HER MOTHER'S PLAN TO KEEP ANY HORSE,
THAT IF SHE WERE TO ALTER HER RESOLUTION IN FAVOUR OF
THIS GIFT, SHE MUST BUY ANOTHER FOR THE SERVANT, AND
KEEP A SERVANT TO RIDE IT, AND AFTER ALL, BUILD A STABLE
TO RECEIVE THEM, SHE HAD ACCEPTED THE PRESENT WITHOUT
HESITATION, AND TOLD HER SISTER OF IT IN RAPTURES.

"HE INTENDS TO SEND HIS GROOM INTO SOMERSETSHIRE
IMMEDIATELY FOR IT," SHE ADDED, "AND WHEN IT ARRIVES WE
WILL RIDE EVERY DAY.  YOU SHALL SHARE ITS USE WITH ME.
IMAGINE TO YOURSELF, MY DEAR ELINOR, THE DELIGHT OF A GALLOP
ON SOME OF THESE DOWNS."

MOST UNWILLING WAS SHE TO AWAKEN FROM SUCH A DREAM OF
FELICITY TO COMPREHEND ALL THE UNHAPPY TRUTHS WHICH ATTENDED
THE AFFAIR; AND FOR SOME TIME SHE REFUSED TO SUBMIT TO THEM.
AS TO AN ADDITIONAL SERVANT, THE EXPENSE WOULD BE A TRIFLE;
MAMMA SHE WAS SURE WOULD NEVER OBJECT TO IT; AND ANY HORSE
WOULD DO FOR HIM; HE MIGHT ALWAYS GET ONE AT THE PARK;
AS TO A STABLE, THE MEREST SHED WOULD BE SUFFICIENT.
ELINOR THEN VENTURED TO DOUBT THE PROPRIETY OF HER RECEIVING
SUCH A PRESENT FROM A MAN SO LITTLE, OR AT LEAST SO LATELY
KNOWN TO HER.  THIS WAS TOO MUCH.

"YOU ARE MISTAKEN, ELINOR," SAID SHE WARMLY,
"IN SUPPOSING I KNOW VERY LITTLE OF WILLOUGHBY.
I HAVE NOT KNOWN HIM LONG INDEED, BUT I AM MUCH BETTER
ACQUAINTED WITH HIM, THAN I AM WITH ANY OTHER CREATURE
IN THE WORLD, EXCEPT YOURSELF AND MAMA.  IT IS NOT
TIME OR OPPORTUNITY THAT IS TO DETERMINE INTIMACY;--
IT IS DISPOSITION ALONE.  SEVEN YEARS WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT
TO MAKE SOME PEOPLE ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER, AND SEVEN
DAYS ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR OTHERS.  I SHOULD HOLD
MYSELF GUILTY OF GREATER IMPROPRIETY IN ACCEPTING A HORSE
FROM MY BROTHER, THAN FROM WILLOUGHBY.  OF JOHN I KNOW
VERY LITTLE, THOUGH WE HAVE LIVED TOGETHER FOR YEARS;
BUT OF WILLOUGHBY MY JUDGMENT HAS LONG BEEN FORMED."

ELINOR THOUGHT IT WISEST TO TOUCH THAT POINT NO MORE.
SHE KNEW HER SISTER'S TEMPER.  OPPOSITION ON SO TENDER A
SUBJECT WOULD ONLY ATTACH HER THE MORE TO HER OWN OPINION.
BUT BY AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION FOR HER MOTHER,
BY REPRESENTING THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH THAT INDULGENT
MOTHER MUST DRAW ON HERSELF, IF (AS WOULD PROBABLY BE
THE CASE) SHE CONSENTED TO THIS INCREASE OF ESTABLISHMENT,
MARIANNE WAS SHORTLY SUBDUED; AND SHE PROMISED NOT TO
TEMPT HER MOTHER TO SUCH IMPRUDENT KINDNESS BY MENTIONING
THE OFFER, AND TO TELL WILLOUGHBY WHEN SHE SAW HIM NEXT,
THAT IT MUST BE DECLINED.

SHE WAS FAITHFUL TO HER WORD; AND WHEN WILLOUGHBY
CALLED AT THE COTTAGE, THE SAME DAY, ELINOR HEARD HER
EXPRESS HER DISAPPOINTMENT TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE, ON
BEING OBLIGED TO FOREGO THE ACCEPTANCE OF HIS PRESENT.
THE REASONS FOR THIS ALTERATION WERE AT THE SAME TIME RELATED,
AND THEY WERE SUCH AS TO MAKE FURTHER ENTREATY ON HIS
SIDE IMPOSSIBLE.  HIS CONCERN HOWEVER WAS VERY APPARENT;
AND AFTER EXPRESSING IT WITH EARNESTNESS, HE ADDED,
IN THE SAME LOW VOICE,--"BUT, MARIANNE, THE HORSE IS
STILL YOURS, THOUGH YOU CANNOT USE IT NOW.  I SHALL KEEP
IT ONLY TILL YOU CAN CLAIM IT.  WHEN YOU LEAVE BARTON
TO FORM YOUR OWN ESTABLISHMENT IN A MORE LASTING HOME,
QUEEN MAB SHALL RECEIVE YOU."

THIS WAS ALL OVERHEARD BY MISS DASHWOOD; AND IN THE
WHOLE OF THE SENTENCE, IN HIS MANNER OF PRONOUNCING IT,
AND IN HIS ADDRESSING HER SISTER BY HER CHRISTIAN NAME ALONE,
SHE INSTANTLY SAW AN INTIMACY SO DECIDED, A MEANING
SO DIRECT, AS MARKED A PERFECT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM.
FROM THAT MOMENT SHE DOUBTED NOT OF THEIR BEING ENGAGED
TO EACH OTHER; AND THE BELIEF OF IT CREATED NO OTHER SURPRISE
THAN THAT SHE, OR ANY OF THEIR FRIENDS, SHOULD BE LEFT
BY TEMPERS SO FRANK, TO DISCOVER IT BY ACCIDENT.

MARGARET RELATED SOMETHING TO HER THE NEXT DAY,
WHICH PLACED THIS MATTER IN A STILL CLEARER LIGHT.
WILLOUGHBY HAD SPENT THE PRECEDING EVENING WITH THEM,
AND MARGARET, BY BEING LEFT SOME TIME IN THE PARLOUR
WITH ONLY HIM AND MARIANNE, HAD HAD OPPORTUNITY
FOR OBSERVATIONS, WHICH, WITH A MOST IMPORTANT FACE,
SHE COMMUNICATED TO HER ELDEST SISTER, WHEN THEY WERE
NEXT BY THEMSELVES.

"OH, ELINOR!" SHE CRIED, "I HAVE SUCH A SECRET TO
TELL YOU ABOUT MARIANNE.  I AM SURE SHE WILL BE MARRIED
TO MR. WILLOUGHBY VERY SOON."

"YOU HAVE SAID SO," REPLIED ELINOR, "ALMOST EVERY
DAY SINCE THEY FIRST MET ON HIGH-CHURCH DOWN; AND THEY
HAD NOT KNOWN EACH OTHER A WEEK, I BELIEVE, BEFORE YOU
WERE CERTAIN THAT MARIANNE WORE HIS PICTURE ROUND HER NECK;
BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE ONLY THE MINIATURE OF OUR GREAT UNCLE."

"BUT INDEED THIS IS QUITE ANOTHER THING.  I AM SURE
THEY WILL BE MARRIED VERY SOON, FOR HE HAS GOT A LOCK
OF HER HAIR."

"TAKE CARE, MARGARET.  IT MAY BE ONLY THE HAIR
OF SOME GREAT UNCLE OF HIS."

"BUT, INDEED, ELINOR, IT IS MARIANNE'S. I AM ALMOST
SURE IT IS, FOR I SAW HIM CUT IT OFF.  LAST NIGHT
AFTER TEA, WHEN YOU AND MAMA WENT OUT OF THE ROOM,
THEY WERE WHISPERING AND TALKING TOGETHER AS FAST AS
COULD BE, AND HE SEEMED TO BE BEGGING SOMETHING OF HER,
AND PRESENTLY HE TOOK UP HER SCISSORS AND CUT OFF A LONG
LOCK OF HER HAIR, FOR IT WAS ALL TUMBLED DOWN HER BACK;
AND HE KISSED IT, AND FOLDED IT UP IN A PIECE OF WHITE PAPER;
AND PUT IT INTO HIS POCKET-BOOK."

FOR SUCH PARTICULARS, STATED ON SUCH AUTHORITY,
ELINOR COULD NOT WITHHOLD HER CREDIT; NOR WAS SHE DISPOSED
TO IT, FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS IN PERFECT UNISON WITH
WHAT SHE HAD HEARD AND SEEN HERSELF.

MARGARET'S SAGACITY WAS NOT ALWAYS DISPLAYED IN A
WAY SO SATISFACTORY TO HER SISTER.  WHEN MRS. JENNINGS
ATTACKED HER ONE EVENING AT THE PARK, TO GIVE THE NAME
OF THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS ELINOR'S PARTICULAR FAVOURITE,
WHICH HAD BEEN LONG A MATTER OF GREAT CURIOSITY TO HER,
MARGARET ANSWERED BY LOOKING AT HER SISTER, AND SAYING,
"I MUST NOT TELL, MAY I, ELINOR?"

THIS OF COURSE MADE EVERY BODY LAUGH; AND ELINOR
TRIED TO LAUGH TOO.  BUT THE EFFORT WAS PAINFUL.
SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT MARGARET HAD FIXED ON A PERSON
WHOSE NAME SHE COULD NOT BEAR WITH COMPOSURE TO BECOME
A STANDING JOKE WITH MRS. JENNINGS.

MARIANNE FELT FOR HER MOST SINCERELY; BUT SHE DID
MORE HARM THAN GOOD TO THE CAUSE, BY TURNING VERY RED
AND SAYING IN AN ANGRY MANNER TO MARGARET,

"REMEMBER THAT WHATEVER YOUR CONJECTURES MAY BE,
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO REPEAT THEM."

"I NEVER HAD ANY CONJECTURES ABOUT IT," REPLIED MARGARET;
"IT WAS YOU WHO TOLD ME OF IT YOURSELF."

THIS INCREASED THE MIRTH OF THE COMPANY, AND MARGARET
WAS EAGERLY PRESSED TO SAY SOMETHING MORE.

"OH! PRAY, MISS MARGARET, LET US KNOW ALL ABOUT IT,"
SAID MRS. JENNINGS.  "WHAT IS THE GENTLEMAN'S NAME?"

"I MUST NOT TELL, MA'AM. BUT I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT IT IS;
AND I KNOW WHERE HE IS TOO."

"YES, YES, WE CAN GUESS WHERE HE IS; AT HIS OWN HOUSE
AT NORLAND TO BE SURE.  HE IS THE CURATE OF THE PARISH
I DARE SAY."

"NO, THAT HE IS NOT.  HE IS OF NO PROFESSION AT ALL."

"MARGARET," SAID MARIANNE WITH GREAT WARMTH,
"YOU KNOW THAT ALL THIS IS AN INVENTION OF YOUR OWN,
AND THAT THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON IN EXISTENCE."

"WELL, THEN, HE IS LATELY DEAD, MARIANNE, FOR I
AM SURE THERE WAS SUCH A MAN ONCE, AND HIS NAME BEGINS
WITH AN F."

MOST GRATEFUL DID ELINOR FEEL TO LADY MIDDLETON
FOR OBSERVING, AT THIS MOMENT, "THAT IT RAINED VERY HARD,"
THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THE INTERRUPTION TO PROCEED LESS FROM
ANY ATTENTION TO HER, THAN FROM HER LADYSHIP'S GREAT DISLIKE
OF ALL SUCH INELEGANT SUBJECTS OF RAILLERY AS DELIGHTED
HER HUSBAND AND MOTHER.  THE IDEA HOWEVER STARTED BY HER,
WAS IMMEDIATELY PURSUED BY COLONEL BRANDON, WHO WAS
ON EVERY OCCASION MINDFUL OF THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS;
AND MUCH WAS SAID ON THE SUBJECT OF RAIN BY BOTH OF THEM.
WILLOUGHBY OPENED THE PIANO-FORTE, AND ASKED MARIANNE
TO SIT DOWN TO IT; AND THUS AMIDST THE VARIOUS ENDEAVOURS
OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO QUIT THE TOPIC, IT FELL TO THE GROUND.
BUT NOT SO EASILY DID ELINOR RECOVER FROM THE ALARM INTO
WHICH IT HAD THROWN HER.

A PARTY WAS FORMED THIS EVENING FOR GOING ON THE
FOLLOWING DAY TO SEE A VERY FINE PLACE ABOUT TWELVE MILES
FROM BARTON, BELONGING TO A BROTHER-IN-LAW OF COLONEL BRANDON,
WITHOUT WHOSE INTEREST IT COULD NOT BE SEEN, AS THE PROPRIETOR,
WHO WAS THEN ABROAD, HAD LEFT STRICT ORDERS ON THAT HEAD.
THE GROUNDS WERE DECLARED TO BE HIGHLY BEAUTIFUL,
AND SIR JOHN, WHO WAS PARTICULARLY WARM IN THEIR PRAISE,
MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE A TOLERABLE JUDGE, FOR HE HAD
FORMED PARTIES TO VISIT THEM, AT LEAST, TWICE EVERY SUMMER
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS.  THEY CONTAINED A NOBLE PIECE
OF WATER; A SAIL ON WHICH WAS TO A FORM A GREAT PART OF
THE MORNING'S AMUSEMENT; COLD PROVISIONS WERE TO BE TAKEN,
OPEN CARRIAGES ONLY TO BE EMPLOYED, AND EVERY THING
CONDUCTED IN THE USUAL STYLE OF A COMPLETE PARTY OF PLEASURE.

TO SOME FEW OF THE COMPANY IT APPEARED RATHER
A BOLD UNDERTAKING, CONSIDERING THE TIME OF YEAR,
AND THAT IT HAD RAINED EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST FORTNIGHT;--
AND MRS. DASHWOOD, WHO HAD ALREADY A COLD, WAS PERSUADED
BY ELINOR TO STAY AT HOME.



CHAPTER 13


THEIR INTENDED EXCURSION TO WHITWELL TURNED OUT
VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT ELINOR HAD EXPECTED.  SHE WAS
PREPARED TO BE WET THROUGH, FATIGUED, AND FRIGHTENED;
BUT THE EVENT WAS STILL MORE UNFORTUNATE, FOR THEY DID
NOT GO AT ALL.

BY TEN O'CLOCK THE WHOLE PARTY WAS ASSEMBLED AT
THE PARK, WHERE THEY WERE TO BREAKFAST.  THE MORNING
WAS RATHER FAVOURABLE, THOUGH IT HAD RAINED ALL NIGHT,
AS THE CLOUDS WERE THEN DISPERSING ACROSS THE SKY,
AND THE SUN FREQUENTLY APPEARED.  THEY WERE ALL IN HIGH
SPIRITS AND GOOD HUMOUR, EAGER TO BE HAPPY, AND DETERMINED
TO SUBMIT TO THE GREATEST INCONVENIENCES AND HARDSHIPS
RATHER THAN BE OTHERWISE.

WHILE THEY WERE AT BREAKFAST THE LETTERS WERE BROUGHT IN.
AMONG THE REST THERE WAS ONE FOR COLONEL BRANDON;--HE
TOOK IT, LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION, CHANGED COLOUR,
AND IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE ROOM.

"WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH BRANDON?" SAID SIR JOHN.

NOBODY COULD TELL.

"I HOPE HE HAS HAD NO BAD NEWS," SAID LADY MIDDLETON.
"IT MUST BE SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY THAT COULD MAKE COLONEL
BRANDON LEAVE MY BREAKFAST TABLE SO SUDDENLY."

IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES HE RETURNED.

"NO BAD NEWS, COLONEL, I HOPE;" SAID MRS. JENNINGS,
AS SOON AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM.

"NONE AT ALL, MA'AM, I THANK YOU."

"WAS IT FROM AVIGNON?  I HOPE IT IS NOT TO SAY
THAT YOUR SISTER IS WORSE."

"NO, MA'AM. IT CAME FROM TOWN, AND IS MERELY
A LETTER OF BUSINESS."

"BUT HOW CAME THE HAND TO DISCOMPOSE YOU SO MUCH,
IF IT WAS ONLY A LETTER OF BUSINESS?  COME, COME,
THIS WON'T DO, COLONEL; SO LET US HEAR THE TRUTH OF IT."

"MY DEAR MADAM," SAID LADY MIDDLETON, "RECOLLECT WHAT
YOU ARE SAYING."

"PERHAPS IT IS TO TELL YOU THAT YOUR COUSIN FANNY
IS MARRIED?" SAID MRS. JENNINGS, WITHOUT ATTENDING
TO HER DAUGHTER'S REPROOF.

"NO, INDEED, IT IS NOT."

"WELL, THEN, I KNOW WHO IT IS FROM, COLONEL.  AND I
HOPE SHE IS WELL."

"WHOM DO YOU MEAN, MA'AM?" SAID HE, COLOURING A LITTLE.

"OH! YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN."

"I AM PARTICULARLY SORRY, MA'AM," SAID HE,
ADDRESSING LADY MIDDLETON, "THAT I SHOULD RECEIVE THIS
LETTER TODAY, FOR IT IS ON BUSINESS WHICH REQUIRES
MY IMMEDIATE ATTENDANCE IN TOWN."

"IN TOWN!" CRIED MRS. JENNINGS.  "WHAT CAN YOU
HAVE TO DO IN TOWN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR?"

"MY OWN LOSS IS GREAT," BE CONTINUED, "IN BEING OBLIGED
TO LEAVE SO AGREEABLE A PARTY; BUT I AM THE MORE CONCERNED,
AS I FEAR MY PRESENCE IS NECESSARY TO GAIN YOUR ADMITTANCE
AT WHITWELL."

WHAT A BLOW UPON THEM ALL WAS THIS!

"BUT IF YOU WRITE A NOTE TO THE HOUSEKEEPER, MR. BRANDON,"
SAID MARIANNE, EAGERLY, "WILL IT NOT BE SUFFICIENT?"

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD.

"WE MUST GO," SAID SIR JOHN.--"IT SHALL NOT BE PUT
OFF WHEN WE ARE SO NEAR IT.  YOU CANNOT GO TO TOWN TILL
TOMORROW, BRANDON, THAT IS ALL."

"I WISH IT COULD BE SO EASILY SETTLED.  BUT IT
IS NOT IN MY POWER TO DELAY MY JOURNEY FOR ONE DAY!"

"IF YOU WOULD BUT LET US KNOW WHAT YOUR BUSINESS IS,"
SAID MRS. JENNINGS, "WE MIGHT SEE WHETHER IT COULD BE PUT
OFF OR NOT."

"YOU WOULD NOT BE SIX HOURS LATER," SAID WILLOUGHBY,
"IF YOU WERE TO DEFER YOUR JOURNEY TILL OUR RETURN."

"I CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE ONE HOUR."--

ELINOR THEN HEARD WILLOUGHBY SAY, IN A LOW VOICE TO MARIANNE,
"THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO CANNOT BEAR A PARTY OF PLEASURE.
BRANDON IS ONE OF THEM.  HE WAS AFRAID OF CATCHING COLD
I DARE SAY, AND INVENTED THIS TRICK FOR GETTING OUT OF IT.
I WOULD LAY FIFTY GUINEAS THE LETTER WAS OF HIS OWN WRITING."

"I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT," REPLIED MARIANNE.

"THERE IS NO PERSUADING YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MIND,
BRANDON, I KNOW OF OLD," SAID SIR JOHN, "WHEN ONCE YOU
ARE DETERMINED ON ANYTHING.  BUT, HOWEVER, I HOPE YOU
WILL THINK BETTER OF IT.  CONSIDER, HERE ARE THE TWO MISS
CAREYS COME OVER FROM NEWTON, THE THREE MISS DASHWOODS
WALKED UP FROM THE COTTAGE, AND MR. WILLOUGHBY GOT UP
TWO HOURS BEFORE HIS USUAL TIME, ON PURPOSE TO GO TO WHITWELL."

COLONEL BRANDON AGAIN REPEATED HIS SORROW AT BEING
THE CAUSE OF DISAPPOINTING THE PARTY; BUT AT THE SAME
TIME DECLARED IT TO BE UNAVOIDABLE.

"WELL, THEN, WHEN WILL YOU COME BACK AGAIN?"

"I HOPE WE SHALL SEE YOU AT BARTON," ADDED HER LADYSHIP,
"AS SOON AS YOU CAN CONVENIENTLY LEAVE TOWN; AND WE MUST
PUT OFF THE PARTY TO WHITWELL TILL YOU RETURN."

"YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING.  BUT IT IS SO UNCERTAIN,
WHEN I MAY HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO RETURN, THAT I DARE
NOT ENGAGE FOR IT AT ALL."

"OH! HE MUST AND SHALL COME BACK," CRIED SIR JOHN.
"IF HE IS NOT HERE BY THE END OF THE WEEK, I SHALL GO
AFTER HIM."

"AY, SO DO, SIR JOHN," CRIED MRS. JENNINGS, "AND THEN
PERHAPS YOU MAY FIND OUT WHAT HIS BUSINESS IS."

"I DO NOT WANT TO PRY INTO OTHER MEN'S CONCERNS.
I SUPPOSE IT IS SOMETHING HE IS ASHAMED OF."

COLONEL BRANDON'S HORSES WERE ANNOUNCED.

"YOU DO NOT GO TO TOWN ON HORSEBACK, DO YOU?"
ADDED SIR JOHN.

"NO. ONLY TO HONITON.  I SHALL THEN GO POST."

"WELL, AS YOU ARE RESOLVED TO GO, I WISH YOU
A GOOD JOURNEY.  BUT YOU HAD BETTER CHANGE YOUR MIND."

"I ASSURE YOU IT IS NOT IN MY POWER."

HE THEN TOOK LEAVE OF THE WHOLE PARTY.

"IS THERE NO CHANCE OF MY SEEING YOU AND YOUR SISTERS
IN TOWN THIS WINTER, MISS DASHWOOD?"

"I AM AFRAID, NONE AT ALL."

"THEN I MUST BID YOU FAREWELL FOR A LONGER TIME
THAN I SHOULD WISH TO DO."

TO MARIANNE, HE MERELY BOWED AND SAID NOTHING.

"COME COLONEL," SAID MRS. JENNINGS, "BEFORE YOU GO,
DO LET US KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING ABOUT."

HE WISHED HER A GOOD MORNING, AND, ATTENDED BY SIR JOHN,
LEFT THE ROOM.

THE COMPLAINTS AND LAMENTATIONS WHICH POLITENESS
HAD HITHERTO RESTRAINED, NOW BURST FORTH UNIVERSALLY;
AND THEY ALL AGREED AGAIN AND AGAIN HOW PROVOKING IT WAS
TO BE SO DISAPPOINTED.

"I CAN GUESS WHAT HIS BUSINESS IS, HOWEVER,"
SAID MRS. JENNINGS EXULTINGLY.

"CAN YOU, MA'AM?" SAID ALMOST EVERY BODY.

"YES; IT IS ABOUT MISS WILLIAMS, I AM SURE."

"AND WHO IS MISS WILLIAMS?" ASKED MARIANNE.

"WHAT! DO NOT YOU KNOW WHO MISS WILLIAMS IS? I AM
SURE YOU MUST HAVE HEARD OF HER BEFORE.  SHE IS A RELATION
OF THE COLONEL'S, MY DEAR; A VERY NEAR RELATION.  WE WILL
NOT SAY HOW NEAR, FOR FEAR OF SHOCKING THE YOUNG LADIES."
THEN, LOWERING HER VOICE A LITTLE, SHE SAID TO ELINOR,
"SHE IS HIS NATURAL DAUGHTER."

"INDEED!"

"OH, YES; AND AS LIKE HIM AS SHE CAN STARE.
I DARE SAY THE COLONEL WILL LEAVE HER ALL HIS FORTUNE."

WHEN SIR JOHN RETURNED, HE JOINED MOST HEARTILY
IN THE GENERAL REGRET ON SO UNFORTUNATE AN EVENT;
CONCLUDING HOWEVER BY OBSERVING, THAT AS THEY WERE
ALL GOT TOGETHER, THEY MUST DO SOMETHING BY WAY OF
BEING HAPPY; AND AFTER SOME CONSULTATION IT WAS AGREED,
THAT ALTHOUGH HAPPINESS COULD ONLY BE ENJOYED AT WHITWELL,
THEY MIGHT PROCURE A TOLERABLE COMPOSURE OF MIND BY DRIVING
ABOUT THE COUNTRY.  THE CARRIAGES WERE THEN ORDERED;
WILLOUGHBY'S WAS FIRST, AND MARIANNE NEVER LOOKED
HAPPIER THAN WHEN SHE GOT INTO IT.  HE DROVE THROUGH
THE PARK VERY FAST, AND THEY WERE SOON OUT OF SIGHT;
AND NOTHING MORE OF THEM WAS SEEN TILL THEIR RETURN,
WHICH DID NOT HAPPEN TILL AFTER THE RETURN OF ALL THE REST.
THEY BOTH SEEMED DELIGHTED WITH THEIR DRIVE; BUT SAID
ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS THAT THEY HAD KEPT IN THE LANES,
WHILE THE OTHERS WENT ON THE DOWNS.

IT WAS SETTLED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A DANCE IN THE EVENING,
AND THAT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE EXTREMELY MERRY ALL DAY LONG.
SOME MORE OF THE CAREYS CAME TO DINNER, AND THEY HAD THE
PLEASURE OF SITTING DOWN NEARLY TWENTY TO TABLE, WHICH SIR
JOHN OBSERVED WITH GREAT CONTENTMENT.  WILLOUGHBY TOOK
HIS USUAL PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO ELDER MISS DASHWOODS.
MRS. JENNINGS SAT ON ELINOR'S RIGHT HAND; AND THEY HAD NOT
BEEN LONG SEATED, BEFORE SHE LEANT BEHIND HER AND WILLOUGHBY,
AND SAID TO MARIANNE, LOUD ENOUGH FOR THEM BOTH TO HEAR,
"I HAVE FOUND YOU OUT IN SPITE OF ALL YOUR TRICKS.
I KNOW WHERE YOU SPENT THE MORNING."

MARIANNE COLOURED, AND REPLIED VERY HASTILY,
"WHERE, PRAY?"--

"DID NOT YOU KNOW," SAID WILLOUGHBY, "THAT WE HAD
BEEN OUT IN MY CURRICLE?"

"YES, YES, MR. IMPUDENCE, I KNOW THAT VERY WELL,
AND I WAS DETERMINED TO FIND OUT WHERE YOU HAD BEEN TO.--
I HOPE YOU LIKE YOUR HOUSE, MISS MARIANNE.  IT IS A VERY
LARGE ONE, I KNOW; AND WHEN I COME TO SEE YOU, I HOPE YOU
WILL HAVE NEW-FURNISHED IT, FOR IT WANTED IT VERY MUCH
WHEN I WAS THERE SIX YEARS AGO."

MARIANNE TURNED AWAY IN GREAT CONFUSION.
MRS. JENNINGS LAUGHED HEARTILY; AND ELINOR FOUND THAT IN HER
RESOLUTION TO KNOW WHERE THEY HAD BEEN, SHE HAD ACTUALLY
MADE HER OWN WOMAN ENQUIRE OF MR. WILLOUGHBY'S GROOM;
AND THAT SHE HAD BY THAT METHOD BEEN INFORMED THAT THEY
HAD GONE TO ALLENHAM, AND SPENT A CONSIDERABLE TIME THERE
IN WALKING ABOUT THE GARDEN AND GOING ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

ELINOR COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THIS TO BE TRUE,
AS IT SEEMED VERY UNLIKELY THAT WILLOUGHBY SHOULD PROPOSE,
OR MARIANNE CONSENT, TO ENTER THE HOUSE WHILE MRS. SMITH WAS
IN IT, WITH WHOM MARIANNE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST ACQUAINTANCE.

AS SOON AS THEY LEFT THE DINING-ROOM, ELINOR ENQUIRED
OF HER ABOUT IT; AND GREAT WAS HER SURPRISE WHEN SHE
FOUND THAT EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE RELATED BY MRS. JENNINGS
WAS PERFECTLY TRUE.  MARIANNE WAS QUITE ANGRY WITH HER
FOR DOUBTING IT.

"WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE, ELINOR, THAT WE DID NOT
GO THERE, OR THAT WE DID NOT SEE THE HOUSE?  IS NOT IT
WHAT YOU HAVE OFTEN WISHED TO DO YOURSELF?"

"YES, MARIANNE, BUT I WOULD NOT GO WHILE MRS. SMITH
WAS THERE, AND WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN MR. WILLOUGHBY."

"MR. WILLOUGHBY HOWEVER IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN
HAVE A RIGHT TO SHEW THAT HOUSE; AND AS HE WENT IN AN OPEN
CARRIAGE, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE ANY OTHER COMPANION.
I NEVER SPENT A PLEASANTER MORNING IN MY LIFE."

"I AM AFRAID," REPLIED ELINOR, "THAT THE PLEASANTNESS
OF AN EMPLOYMENT DOES NOT ALWAYS EVINCE ITS PROPRIETY."

"ON THE CONTRARY, NOTHING CAN BE A STRONGER PROOF
OF IT, ELINOR; FOR IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY REAL IMPROPRIETY
IN WHAT I DID, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SENSIBLE OF IT AT
THE TIME, FOR WE ALWAYS KNOW WHEN WE ARE ACTING WRONG,
AND WITH SUCH A CONVICTION I COULD HAVE HAD NO PLEASURE."

"BUT, MY DEAR MARIANNE, AS IT HAS ALREADY EXPOSED YOU
TO SOME VERY IMPERTINENT REMARKS, DO YOU NOT NOW BEGIN
TO DOUBT THE DISCRETION OF YOUR OWN CONDUCT?"

"IF THE IMPERTINENT REMARKS OF MRS. JENNINGS ARE
TO BE THE PROOF OF IMPROPRIETY IN CONDUCT, WE ARE ALL
OFFENDING EVERY MOMENT OF OUR LIVES.  I VALUE NOT HER
CENSURE ANY MORE THAN I SHOULD DO HER COMMENDATION.
I AM NOT SENSIBLE OF HAVING DONE ANYTHING WRONG IN WALKING
OVER MRS. SMITH'S GROUNDS, OR IN SEEING HER HOUSE.
THEY WILL ONE DAY BE MR. WILLOUGHBY'S, AND--"

"IF THEY WERE ONE DAY TO BE YOUR OWN, MARIANNE,
YOU WOULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED IN WHAT YOU HAVE DONE."

SHE BLUSHED AT THIS HINT; BUT IT WAS EVEN VISIBLY
GRATIFYING TO HER; AND AFTER A TEN MINUTES' INTERVAL OF
EARNEST THOUGHT, SHE CAME TO HER SISTER AGAIN, AND SAID
WITH GREAT GOOD HUMOUR, "PERHAPS, ELINOR, IT WAS RATHER
ILL-JUDGED IN ME TO GO TO ALLENHAM; BUT MR. WILLOUGHBY WANTED
PARTICULARLY TO SHEW ME THE PLACE; AND IT IS A CHARMING HOUSE,
I ASSURE YOU.--THERE IS ONE REMARKABLY PRETTY SITTING ROOM
UP STAIRS; OF A NICE COMFORTABLE SIZE FOR CONSTANT USE,
AND WITH MODERN FURNITURE IT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL.
IT IS A CORNER ROOM, AND HAS WINDOWS ON TWO SIDES.
ON ONE SIDE YOU LOOK ACROSS THE BOWLING-GREEN, BEHIND
THE HOUSE, TO A BEAUTIFUL HANGING WOOD, AND ON THE OTHER YOU
HAVE A VIEW OF THE CHURCH AND VILLAGE, AND, BEYOND THEM,
OF THOSE FINE BOLD HILLS THAT WE HAVE SO OFTEN ADMIRED.
I DID NOT SEE IT TO ADVANTAGE, FOR NOTHING COULD BE
MORE FORLORN THAN THE FURNITURE,--BUT IF IT WERE NEWLY
FITTED UP--A COUPLE OF HUNDRED POUNDS, WILLOUGHBY SAYS,
WOULD MAKE IT ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST SUMMER-ROOMS
IN ENGLAND."

COULD ELINOR HAVE LISTENED TO HER WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
FROM THE OTHERS, SHE WOULD HAVE DESCRIBED EVERY ROOM
IN THE HOUSE WITH EQUAL DELIGHT.



CHAPTER 14


THE SUDDEN TERMINATION OF COLONEL BRANDON'S VISIT
AT THE PARK, WITH HIS STEADINESS IN CONCEALING ITS CAUSE,
FILLED THE MIND, AND RAISED THE WONDER OF MRS. JENNINGS
FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS; SHE WAS A GREAT WONDERER, AS EVERY
ONE MUST BE WHO TAKES A VERY LIVELY INTEREST IN ALL THE
COMINGS AND GOINGS OF ALL THEIR ACQUAINTANCE.  SHE WONDERED,
WITH LITTLE INTERMISSION WHAT COULD BE THE REASON OF IT;
WAS SURE THERE MUST BE SOME BAD NEWS, AND THOUGHT OVER
EVERY KIND OF DISTRESS THAT COULD HAVE BEFALLEN HIM,
WITH A FIXED DETERMINATION THAT HE SHOULD NOT ESCAPE
THEM ALL.

"SOMETHING VERY MELANCHOLY MUST BE THE MATTER,
I AM SURE," SAID SHE.  "I COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE.
POOR MAN!  I AM AFRAID HIS CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE BAD.
THE ESTATE AT DELAFORD WAS NEVER RECKONED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND
A YEAR, AND HIS BROTHER LEFT EVERYTHING SADLY INVOLVED.
I DO THINK HE MUST HAVE BEEN SENT FOR ABOUT MONEY MATTERS,
FOR WHAT ELSE CAN IT BE?  I WONDER WHETHER IT IS SO.
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF IT.  PERHAPS IT
IS ABOUT MISS WILLIAMS AND, BY THE BYE, I DARE SAY IT IS,
BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO CONSCIOUS WHEN I MENTIONED HER.
MAY BE SHE IS ILL IN TOWN; NOTHING IN THE WORLD MORE LIKELY,
FOR I HAVE A NOTION SHE IS ALWAYS RATHER SICKLY.
I WOULD LAY ANY WAGER IT IS ABOUT MISS WILLIAMS.
IT IS NOT SO VERY LIKELY HE SHOULD BE DISTRESSED IN
HIS CIRCUMSTANCES NOW, FOR HE IS A VERY PRUDENT MAN,
AND TO BE SURE MUST HAVE CLEARED THE ESTATE BY THIS TIME.
I WONDER WHAT IT CAN BE!  MAY BE HIS SISTER IS WORSE
AT AVIGNON, AND HAS SENT FOR HIM OVER.  HIS SETTING OFF
IN SUCH A HURRY SEEMS VERY LIKE IT.  WELL, I WISH HIM OUT
OF ALL HIS TROUBLE WITH ALL MY HEART, AND A GOOD WIFE INTO
THE BARGAIN."

SO WONDERED, SO TALKED MRS. JENNINGS.  HER OPINION
VARYING WITH EVERY FRESH CONJECTURE, AND ALL SEEMING
EQUALLY PROBABLE AS THEY AROSE.  ELINOR, THOUGH SHE FELT
REALLY INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF COLONEL BRANDON,
COULD NOT BESTOW ALL THE WONDER ON HIS GOING SO SUDDENLY
AWAY, WHICH MRS. JENNINGS WAS DESIROUS OF HER FEELING;
FOR BESIDES THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID NOT IN HER OPINION
JUSTIFY SUCH LASTING AMAZEMENT OR VARIETY OF SPECULATION,
HER WONDER WAS OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF.  IT WAS ENGROSSED
BY THE EXTRAORDINARY SILENCE OF HER SISTER AND WILLOUGHBY
ON THE SUBJECT, WHICH THEY MUST KNOW TO BE PECULIARLY
INTERESTING TO THEM ALL.  AS THIS SILENCE CONTINUED,
EVERY DAY MADE IT APPEAR MORE STRANGE AND MORE INCOMPATIBLE
WITH THE DISPOSITION OF BOTH.  WHY THEY SHOULD NOT OPENLY
ACKNOWLEDGE TO HER MOTHER AND HERSELF, WHAT THEIR CONSTANT
BEHAVIOUR TO EACH OTHER DECLARED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE,
ELINOR COULD NOT IMAGINE.

SHE COULD EASILY CONCEIVE THAT MARRIAGE MIGHT NOT
BE IMMEDIATELY IN THEIR POWER; FOR THOUGH WILLOUGHBY
WAS INDEPENDENT, THERE WAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE HIM RICH.
HIS ESTATE HAD BEEN RATED BY SIR JOHN AT ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN
HUNDRED A YEAR; BUT HE LIVED AT AN EXPENSE TO WHICH THAT INCOME
COULD HARDLY BE EQUAL, AND HE HAD HIMSELF OFTEN COMPLAINED
OF HIS POVERTY.  BUT FOR THIS STRANGE KIND OF SECRECY
MAINTAINED BY THEM RELATIVE TO THEIR ENGAGEMENT, WHICH
IN FACT CONCEALED NOTHING AT ALL, SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT;
AND IT WAS SO WHOLLY CONTRADICTORY TO THEIR GENERAL
OPINIONS AND PRACTICE, THAT A DOUBT SOMETIMES ENTERED
HER MIND OF THEIR BEING REALLY ENGAGED, AND THIS DOUBT
WAS ENOUGH TO PREVENT HER MAKING ANY INQUIRY OF MARIANNE.

NOTHING COULD BE MORE EXPRESSIVE OF ATTACHMENT
TO THEM ALL, THAN WILLOUGHBY'S BEHAVIOUR.  TO MARIANNE
IT HAD ALL THE DISTINGUISHING TENDERNESS WHICH A LOVER'S
HEART COULD GIVE, AND TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY IT WAS THE
AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION OF A SON AND A BROTHER.  THE COTTAGE
SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERED AND LOVED BY HIM AS HIS HOME;
MANY MORE OF HIS HOURS WERE SPENT THERE THAN AT ALLENHAM;
AND IF NO GENERAL ENGAGEMENT COLLECTED THEM AT THE PARK,
THE EXERCISE WHICH CALLED HIM OUT IN THE MORNING WAS
ALMOST CERTAIN OF ENDING THERE, WHERE THE REST OF THE DAY
WAS SPENT BY HIMSELF AT THE SIDE OF MARIANNE, AND BY HIS
FAVOURITE POINTER AT HER FEET.

ONE EVENING IN PARTICULAR, ABOUT A WEEK AFTER
COLONEL BRANDON LEFT THE COUNTRY, HIS HEART SEEMED
MORE THAN USUALLY OPEN TO EVERY FEELING OF ATTACHMENT
TO THE OBJECTS AROUND HIM; AND ON MRS. DASHWOOD'S
HAPPENING TO MENTION HER DESIGN OF IMPROVING THE COTTAGE
IN THE SPRING, HE WARMLY OPPOSED EVERY ALTERATION
OF A PLACE WHICH AFFECTION HAD ESTABLISHED AS PERFECT WITH HIM.

"WHAT!" HE EXCLAIMED--"IMPROVE THIS DEAR COTTAGE!
NO. THAT I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO.  NOT A STONE MUST
BE ADDED TO ITS WALLS, NOT AN INCH TO ITS SIZE,
IF MY FEELINGS ARE REGARDED."

"DO NOT BE ALARMED," SAID MISS DASHWOOD,
"NOTHING OF THE KIND WILL BE DONE; FOR MY MOTHER
WILL NEVER HAVE MONEY ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT IT."

"I AM HEARTILY GLAD OF IT," HE CRIED.  "MAY SHE
ALWAYS BE POOR, IF SHE CAN EMPLOY HER RICHES NO BETTER."

"THANK YOU, WILLOUGHBY.  BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I
WOULD NOT SACRIFICE ONE SENTIMENT OF LOCAL ATTACHMENT
OF YOURS, OR OF ANY ONE WHOM I LOVED, FOR ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS
IN THE WORLD.  DEPEND UPON IT THAT WHATEVER UNEMPLOYED
SUM MAY REMAIN, WHEN I MAKE UP MY ACCOUNTS IN THE SPRING,
I WOULD EVEN RATHER LAY IT USELESSLY BY THAN DISPOSE
OF IT IN A MANNER SO PAINFUL TO YOU.  BUT ARE YOU REALLY
SO ATTACHED TO THIS PLACE AS TO SEE NO DEFECT IN IT?"

"I AM," SAID HE.  "TO ME IT IS FAULTLESS.  NAY, MORE,
I CONSIDER IT AS THE ONLY FORM OF BUILDING IN WHICH HAPPINESS
IS ATTAINABLE, AND WERE I RICH ENOUGH I WOULD INSTANTLY PULL
COMBE DOWN, AND BUILD IT UP AGAIN IN THE EXACT PLAN OF THIS
COTTAGE."

"WITH DARK NARROW STAIRS AND A KITCHEN THAT SMOKES,
I SUPPOSE," SAID ELINOR.

"YES," CRIED HE IN THE SAME EAGER TONE, "WITH ALL
AND EVERY THING BELONGING TO IT;--IN NO ONE CONVENIENCE
OR INCONVENIENCE ABOUT IT, SHOULD THE LEAST VARIATION
BE PERCEPTIBLE.  THEN, AND THEN ONLY, UNDER SUCH A ROOF, I
MIGHT PERHAPS BE AS HAPPY AT COMBE AS I HAVE BEEN AT BARTON."

"I FLATTER MYSELF," REPLIED ELINOR, "THAT EVEN UNDER
THE DISADVANTAGE OF BETTER ROOMS AND A BROADER STAIRCASE,
YOU WILL HEREAFTER FIND YOUR OWN HOUSE AS FAULTLESS AS YOU
NOW DO THIS."

"THERE CERTAINLY ARE CIRCUMSTANCES," SAID WILLOUGHBY,
"WHICH MIGHT GREATLY ENDEAR IT TO ME; BUT THIS PLACE WILL
ALWAYS HAVE ONE CLAIM OF MY AFFECTION, WHICH NO OTHER CAN
POSSIBLY SHARE."

MRS. DASHWOOD LOOKED WITH PLEASURE AT MARIANNE,
WHOSE FINE EYES WERE FIXED SO EXPRESSIVELY ON WILLOUGHBY,
AS PLAINLY DENOTED HOW WELL SHE UNDERSTOOD HIM.

"HOW OFTEN DID I WISH," ADDED HE, "WHEN I WAS AT
ALLENHAM THIS TIME TWELVEMONTH, THAT BARTON COTTAGE WERE
INHABITED!  I NEVER PASSED WITHIN VIEW OF IT WITHOUT ADMIRING
ITS SITUATION, AND GRIEVING THAT NO ONE SHOULD LIVE IN IT.
HOW LITTLE DID I THEN THINK THAT THE VERY FIRST NEWS
I SHOULD HEAR FROM MRS. SMITH, WHEN I NEXT CAME INTO
THE COUNTRY, WOULD BE THAT BARTON COTTAGE WAS TAKEN: AND I
FELT AN IMMEDIATE SATISFACTION AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT,
WHICH NOTHING BUT A KIND OF PRESCIENCE OF WHAT HAPPINESS I
SHOULD EXPERIENCE FROM IT, CAN ACCOUNT FOR.  MUST IT NOT HAVE
BEEN SO, MARIANNE?" SPEAKING TO HER IN A LOWERED VOICE.
THEN CONTINUING HIS FORMER TONE, HE SAID, "AND YET THIS
HOUSE YOU WOULD SPOIL, MRS. DASHWOOD?  YOU WOULD ROB IT
OF ITS SIMPLICITY BY IMAGINARY IMPROVEMENT! AND THIS DEAR
PARLOUR IN WHICH OUR ACQUAINTANCE FIRST BEGAN, AND IN WHICH
SO MANY HAPPY HOURS HAVE BEEN SINCE SPENT BY US TOGETHER,
YOU WOULD DEGRADE TO THE CONDITION OF A COMMON ENTRANCE,
AND EVERY BODY WOULD BE EAGER TO PASS THROUGH THE ROOM
WHICH HAS HITHERTO CONTAINED WITHIN ITSELF MORE REAL
ACCOMMODATION AND COMFORT THAN ANY OTHER APARTMENT OF
THE HANDSOMEST DIMENSIONS IN THE WORLD COULD POSSIBLY AFFORD."

MRS. DASHWOOD AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT NO ALTERATION
OF THE KIND SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED.

"YOU ARE A GOOD WOMAN," HE WARMLY REPLIED.
"YOUR PROMISE MAKES ME EASY.  EXTEND IT A LITTLE FARTHER,
AND IT WILL MAKE ME HAPPY.  TELL ME THAT NOT ONLY YOUR
HOUSE WILL REMAIN THE SAME, BUT THAT I SHALL EVER FIND
YOU AND YOURS AS UNCHANGED AS YOUR DWELLING; AND THAT YOU
WILL ALWAYS CONSIDER ME WITH THE KINDNESS WHICH HAS MADE
EVERYTHING BELONGING TO YOU SO DEAR TO ME."

THE PROMISE WAS READILY GIVEN, AND WILLOUGHBY'S
BEHAVIOUR DURING THE WHOLE OF THE EVENING DECLARED
AT ONCE HIS AFFECTION AND HAPPINESS.

"SHALL WE SEE YOU TOMORROW TO DINNER?" SAID MRS. DASHWOOD,
WHEN HE WAS LEAVING THEM.  "I DO NOT ASK YOU TO COME IN
THE MORNING, FOR WE MUST WALK TO THE PARK, TO CALL ON LADY
MIDDLETON."

HE ENGAGED TO BE WITH THEM BY FOUR O'CLOCK.



CHAPTER 15


MRS. DASHWOOD'S VISIT TO LADY MIDDLETON TOOK PLACE
THE NEXT DAY, AND TWO OF HER DAUGHTERS WENT WITH HER;
BUT MARIANNE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM BEING OF THE PARTY,
UNDER SOME TRIFLING PRETEXT OF EMPLOYMENT; AND HER MOTHER,
WHO CONCLUDED THAT A PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE BY WILLOUGHBY
THE NIGHT BEFORE OF CALLING ON HER WHILE THEY WERE ABSENT,
WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HER REMAINING AT HOME.

ON THEIR RETURN FROM THE PARK THEY FOUND WILLOUGHBY'S
CURRICLE AND SERVANT IN WAITING AT THE COTTAGE,
AND MRS. DASHWOOD WAS CONVINCED THAT HER CONJECTURE
HAD BEEN JUST.  SO FAR IT WAS ALL AS SHE HAD FORESEEN;
BUT ON ENTERING THE HOUSE SHE BEHELD WHAT NO FORESIGHT
HAD TAUGHT HER TO EXPECT.  THEY WERE NO SOONER IN THE
PASSAGE THAN MARIANNE CAME HASTILY OUT OF THE PARLOUR
APPARENTLY IN VIOLENT AFFLICTION, WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF
AT HER EYES; AND WITHOUT NOTICING THEM RAN UP STAIRS.
SURPRISED AND ALARMED THEY PROCEEDED DIRECTLY INTO THE ROOM
SHE HAD JUST QUITTED, WHERE THEY FOUND ONLY WILLOUGHBY,
WHO WAS LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL-PIECE WITH HIS BACK
TOWARDS THEM.  HE TURNED ROUND ON THEIR COMING IN,
AND HIS COUNTENANCE SHEWED THAT HE STRONGLY PARTOOK
OF THE EMOTION WHICH OVER-POWERED MARIANNE.

"IS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH HER?" CRIED MRS. DASHWOOD
AS SHE ENTERED--"IS SHE ILL?"

"I HOPE NOT," HE REPLIED, TRYING TO LOOK CHEERFUL;
AND WITH A FORCED SMILE PRESENTLY ADDED, "IT IS I WHO MAY
RATHER EXPECT TO BE ILL--FOR I AM NOW SUFFERING UNDER A
VERY HEAVY DISAPPOINTMENT!"

"DISAPPOINTMENT?"

"YES, FOR I AM UNABLE TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU.
MRS. SMITH HAS THIS MORNING EXERCISED THE PRIVILEGE
OF RICHES UPON A POOR DEPENDENT COUSIN, BY SENDING ME ON
BUSINESS TO LONDON.  I HAVE JUST RECEIVED MY DISPATCHES,
AND TAKEN MY FAREWELL OF ALLENHAM; AND BY WAY OF EXHILARATION
I AM NOW COME TO TAKE MY FAREWELL OF YOU."

"TO LONDON!--AND ARE YOU GOING THIS MORNING?"

"ALMOST THIS MOMENT."

"THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE.  BUT MRS. SMITH MUST
BE OBLIGED;--AND HER BUSINESS WILL NOT DETAIN YOU FROM
US LONG I HOPE."

HE COLOURED AS HE REPLIED, "YOU ARE VERY KIND, BUT I
HAVE NO IDEA OF RETURNING INTO DEVONSHIRE IMMEDIATELY.
MY VISITS TO MRS. SMITH ARE NEVER REPEATED WITHIN
THE TWELVEMONTH."

"AND IS MRS. SMITH YOUR ONLY FRIEND?  IS ALLENHAM THE ONLY
HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO WHICH YOU WILL BE WELCOME?
FOR SHAME, WILLOUGHBY, CAN YOU WAIT FOR AN INVITATION HERE?"

HIS COLOUR INCREASED; AND WITH HIS EYES FIXED
ON THE GROUND HE ONLY REPLIED, "YOU ARE TOO GOOD."

MRS. DASHWOOD LOOKED AT ELINOR WITH SURPRISE.
ELINOR FELT EQUAL AMAZEMENT.  FOR A FEW MOMENTS EVERY ONE
WAS SILENT.  MRS. DASHWOOD FIRST SPOKE.

"I HAVE ONLY TO ADD, MY DEAR WILLOUGHBY, THAT AT
BARTON COTTAGE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOME; FOR I WILL NOT
PRESS YOU TO RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE YOU ONLY
CAN JUDGE HOW FAR THAT MIGHT BE PLEASING TO MRS. SMITH;
AND ON THIS HEAD I SHALL BE NO MORE DISPOSED TO QUESTION
YOUR JUDGMENT THAN TO DOUBT YOUR INCLINATION."

"MY ENGAGEMENTS AT PRESENT," REPLIED WILLOUGHBY,
CONFUSEDLY, "ARE OF SUCH A NATURE--THAT--I DARE NOT FLATTER
MYSELF"--

HE STOPT.  MRS. DASHWOOD WAS TOO MUCH ASTONISHED
TO SPEAK, AND ANOTHER PAUSE SUCCEEDED.  THIS WAS BROKEN
BY WILLOUGHBY, WHO SAID WITH A FAINT SMILE, "IT IS FOLLY
TO LINGER IN THIS MANNER.  I WILL NOT TORMENT MYSELF
ANY LONGER BY REMAINING AMONG FRIENDS WHOSE SOCIETY
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOW TO ENJOY."

HE THEN HASTILY TOOK LEAVE OF THEM ALL AND LEFT
THE ROOM.  THEY SAW HIM STEP INTO HIS CARRIAGE,
AND IN A MINUTE IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT.

MRS. DASHWOOD FELT TOO MUCH FOR SPEECH, AND INSTANTLY
QUITTED THE PARLOUR TO GIVE WAY IN SOLITUDE TO THE CONCERN
AND ALARM WHICH THIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE OCCASIONED.

ELINOR'S UNEASINESS WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO HER MOTHER'S.
SHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD JUST PASSED WITH ANXIETY AND DISTRUST.
WILLOUGHBY'S BEHAVIOUR IN TAKING LEAVE OF THEM, HIS
EMBARRASSMENT,
AND AFFECTATION OF CHEERFULNESS, AND, ABOVE ALL, HIS
UNWILLINGNESS
TO ACCEPT HER MOTHER'S INVITATION, A BACKWARDNESS SO UNLIKE A
LOVER,
SO UNLIKE HIMSELF, GREATLY DISTURBED HER.  ONE MOMENT SHE FEARED
THAT NO SERIOUS DESIGN HAD EVER BEEN FORMED ON HIS SIDE; AND THE
NEXT THAT SOME UNFORTUNATE QUARREL HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIM
AND
HER SISTER;--THE DISTRESS IN WHICH MARIANNE HAD QUITTED THE ROOM
WAS SUCH AS A SERIOUS QUARREL COULD MOST REASONABLY ACCOUNT FOR,
THOUGH WHEN SHE CONSIDERED WHAT MARIANNE'S LOVE FOR HIM WAS,
A QUARREL SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

BUT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR SEPARATION,
HER SISTER'S AFFLICTION WAS INDUBITABLE; AND SHE THOUGHT
WITH THE TENDEREST COMPASSION OF THAT VIOLENT SORROW
WHICH MARIANNE WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY NOT MERELY GIVING
WAY TO AS A RELIEF, BUT FEEDING AND ENCOURAGING AS A DUTY.

IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR HER MOTHER RETURNED, AND THOUGH
HER EYES WERE RED, HER COUNTENANCE WAS NOT UNCHEERFUL.

"OUR DEAR WILLOUGHBY IS NOW SOME MILES FROM BARTON, ELINOR,"
SAID SHE, AS SHE SAT DOWN TO WORK, "AND WITH HOW HEAVY A HEART
DOES HE TRAVEL?"

"IT IS ALL VERY STRANGE.  SO SUDDENLY TO BE GONE! IT
SEEMS BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT.  AND LAST NIGHT HE WAS
WITH US SO HAPPY, SO CHEERFUL, SO AFFECTIONATE?  AND NOW,
AFTER ONLY TEN MINUTES NOTICE--GONE TOO WITHOUT INTENDING
TO RETURN!--SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT BE OWNED TO US MUST
HAVE HAPPENED.  HE DID NOT SPEAK, HE DID NOT BEHAVE
LIKE HIMSELF.  YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE DIFFERENCE AS WELL AS I.
WHAT CAN IT BE?  CAN THEY HAVE QUARRELLED?  WHY ELSE SHOULD HE
HAVE SHEWN SUCH UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION HERE?"--

"IT WAS NOT INCLINATION THAT HE WANTED, ELINOR; I COULD
PLAINLY SEE THAT.  HE HAD NOT THE POWER OF ACCEPTING IT.
I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER I ASSURE YOU, AND I CAN
PERFECTLY ACCOUNT FOR EVERY THING THAT AT FIRST SEEMED
STRANGE TO ME AS WELL AS TO YOU."

"CAN YOU, INDEED!"

"YES. I HAVE EXPLAINED IT TO MYSELF IN THE MOST
SATISFACTORY WAY;--BUT YOU, ELINOR, WHO LOVE TO DOUBT
WHERE YOU CAN--IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOU, I KNOW; BUT YOU
SHALL NOT TALK ME OUT OF MY TRUST IN IT.  I AM PERSUADED
THAT MRS. SMITH SUSPECTS HIS REGARD FOR MARIANNE,
DISAPPROVES OF IT, (PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE HAS OTHER VIEWS
FOR HIM,) AND ON THAT ACCOUNT IS EAGER TO GET HIM AWAY;--
AND THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH SHE SENDS HIM OFF TO TRANSACT
IS INVENTED AS AN EXCUSE TO DISMISS HIM.  THIS IS WHAT I
BELIEVE TO HAVE HAPPENED.  HE IS, MOREOVER, AWARE THAT SHE
DOES DISAPPROVE THE CONNECTION, HE DARES NOT THEREFORE
AT PRESENT CONFESS TO HER HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH MARIANNE,
AND HE FEELS HIMSELF OBLIGED, FROM HIS DEPENDENT SITUATION,
TO GIVE INTO HER SCHEMES, AND ABSENT HIMSELF FROM
DEVONSHIRE FOR A WHILE.  YOU WILL TELL ME, I KNOW,
THAT THIS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED; BUT I WILL LISTEN
TO NO CAVIL, UNLESS YOU CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER METHOD
OF UNDERSTANDING THE AFFAIR AS SATISFACTORY AT THIS.
AND NOW, ELINOR, WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY?"

"NOTHING, FOR YOU HAVE ANTICIPATED MY ANSWER."

"THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME, THAT IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT
HAVE HAPPENED.  OH, ELINOR, HOW INCOMPREHENSIBLE ARE YOUR
FEELINGS!  YOU HAD RATHER TAKE EVIL UPON CREDIT THAN GOOD.
YOU HAD RATHER LOOK OUT FOR MISERY FOR MARIANNE, AND GUILT
FOR POOR WILLOUGHBY, THAN AN APOLOGY FOR THE LATTER.
YOU ARE RESOLVED TO THINK HIM BLAMEABLE, BECAUSE HE TOOK
LEAVE OF US WITH LESS AFFECTION THAN HIS USUAL BEHAVIOUR
HAS SHEWN.  AND IS NO ALLOWANCE TO BE MADE FOR INADVERTENCE,
OR FOR SPIRITS DEPRESSED BY RECENT DISAPPOINTMENT?  ARE
NO PROBABILITIES TO BE ACCEPTED, MERELY BECAUSE THEY
ARE NOT CERTAINTIES?  IS NOTHING DUE TO THE MAN WHOM WE
HAVE ALL SUCH REASON TO LOVE, AND NO REASON IN THE WORLD
TO THINK ILL OF?  TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MOTIVES UNANSWERABLE
IN THEMSELVES, THOUGH UNAVOIDABLY SECRET FOR A WHILE?  AND,
AFTER ALL, WHAT IS IT YOU SUSPECT HIM OF?"

"I CAN HARDLY TELL MYSELF.  BUT SUSPICION OF
SOMETHING UNPLEASANT IS THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE
OF SUCH AN ALTERATION AS WE JUST WITNESSED IN HIM.
THERE IS GREAT TRUTH, HOWEVER, IN WHAT YOU HAVE NOW URGED
OF THE ALLOWANCES WHICH OUGHT TO BE MADE FOR HIM, AND IT
IS MY WISH TO BE CANDID IN MY JUDGMENT OF EVERY BODY.
WILLOUGHBY MAY UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE VERY SUFFICIENT
REASONS FOR HIS CONDUCT, AND I WILL HOPE THAT HE HAS.
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE WILLOUGHBY TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THEM AT ONCE.  SECRECY MAY BE ADVISABLE; BUT STILL I
CANNOT HELP WONDERING AT ITS BEING PRACTICED BY HIM."

"DO NOT BLAME HIM, HOWEVER, FOR DEPARTING FROM
HIS CHARACTER, WHERE THE DEVIATION IS NECESSARY.
BUT YOU REALLY DO ADMIT THE JUSTICE OF WHAT I HAVE SAID
IN HIS DEFENCE?--I AM HAPPY--AND HE IS ACQUITTED."

"NOT ENTIRELY.  IT MAY BE PROPER TO CONCEAL THEIR
ENGAGEMENT (IF THEY ARE ENGAGED) FROM MRS. SMITH--
AND IF THAT IS THE CASE, IT MUST BE HIGHLY EXPEDIENT
FOR WILLOUGHBY TO BE BUT LITTLE IN DEVONSHIRE AT PRESENT.
BUT THIS IS NO EXCUSE FOR THEIR CONCEALING IT FROM US."

"CONCEALING IT FROM US! MY DEAR CHILD, DO YOU ACCUSE
WILLOUGHBY AND MARIANNE OF CONCEALMENT? THIS IS STRANGE
INDEED, WHEN YOUR EYES HAVE BEEN REPROACHING THEM EVERY DAY
FOR INCAUTIOUSNESS."

"I WANT NO PROOF OF THEIR AFFECTION," SAID ELINOR;
"BUT OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT I DO."

"I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED OF BOTH."

"YET NOT A SYLLABLE HAS BEEN SAID TO YOU ON THE
SUBJECT, BY EITHER OF THEM."

"I HAVE NOT WANTED SYLLABLES WHERE ACTIONS HAVE
SPOKEN SO PLAINLY.  HAS NOT HIS BEHAVIOUR TO MARIANNE
AND TO ALL OF US, FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FORTNIGHT,
DECLARED THAT HE LOVED AND CONSIDERED HER AS HIS FUTURE WIFE,
AND THAT HE FELT FOR US THE ATTACHMENT OF THE NEAREST
RELATION?  HAVE WE NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER?
HAS NOT MY CONSENT BEEN DAILY ASKED BY HIS LOOKS, HIS MANNER,
HIS ATTENTIVE AND AFFECTIONATE RESPECT?  MY ELINOR,
IS IT POSSIBLE TO DOUBT THEIR ENGAGEMENT?  HOW COULD
SUCH A THOUGHT OCCUR TO YOU?  HOW IS IT TO BE SUPPOSED
THAT WILLOUGHBY, PERSUADED AS HE MUST BE OF YOUR
SISTER'S LOVE, SHOULD LEAVE HER, AND LEAVE HER PERHAPS
FOR MONTHS, WITHOUT TELLING HER OF HIS AFFECTION;--THAT
THEY SHOULD PART WITHOUT A MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF CONFIDENCE?"

"I CONFESS," REPLIED ELINOR, "THAT EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE
EXCEPT ONE IS IN FAVOUR OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT;
BUT THAT ONE IS THE TOTAL SILENCE OF BOTH ON THE SUBJECT,
AND WITH ME IT ALMOST OUTWEIGHS EVERY OTHER."

"HOW STRANGE THIS IS!  YOU MUST THINK WRETCHEDLY INDEED
OF WILLOUGHBY, IF, AFTER ALL THAT HAS OPENLY PASSED BETWEEN THEM,
YOU CAN DOUBT THE NATURE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY ARE TOGETHER.
HAS HE BEEN ACTING A PART IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO YOUR SISTER
ALL THIS TIME?  DO YOU SUPPOSE HIM REALLY INDIFFERENT TO HER?"

"NO, I CANNOT THINK THAT.  HE MUST AND DOES LOVE HER
I AM SURE."

"BUT WITH A STRANGE KIND OF TENDERNESS, IF HE CAN
LEAVE HER WITH SUCH INDIFFERENCE, SUCH CARELESSNESS
OF THE FUTURE, AS YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM."

"YOU MUST REMEMBER, MY DEAR MOTHER, THAT I HAVE NEVER
CONSIDERED THIS MATTER AS CERTAIN.  I HAVE HAD MY DOUBTS,
I CONFESS; BUT THEY ARE FAINTER THAN THEY WERE, AND THEY
MAY SOON BE ENTIRELY DONE AWAY.  IF WE FIND THEY CORRESPOND,
EVERY FEAR OF MINE WILL BE REMOVED."

"A MIGHTY CONCESSION INDEED!  IF YOU WERE TO SEE
THEM AT THE ALTAR, YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THEY WERE GOING TO
BE MARRIED.  UNGRACIOUS GIRL!  BUT I REQUIRE NO SUCH PROOF.
NOTHING IN MY OPINION HAS EVER PASSED TO JUSTIFY DOUBT;
NO SECRECY HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED; ALL HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY OPEN
AND UNRESERVED.  YOU CANNOT DOUBT YOUR SISTER'S WISHES.
IT MUST BE WILLOUGHBY THEREFORE WHOM YOU SUSPECT.  BUT WHY?
IS HE NOT A MAN OF HONOUR AND FEELING? HAS THERE BEEN ANY
INCONSISTENCY ON HIS SIDE TO CREATE ALARM? CAN HE BE DECEITFUL?"

"I HOPE NOT, I BELIEVE NOT," CRIED ELINOR.
"I LOVE WILLOUGHBY, SINCERELY LOVE HIM; AND SUSPICION OF HIS
INTEGRITY CANNOT BE MORE PAINFUL TO YOURSELF THAN TO ME.
IT HAS BEEN INVOLUNTARY, AND I WILL NOT ENCOURAGE IT.
I WAS STARTLED, I CONFESS, BY THE ALTERATION IN HIS
MANNERS THIS MORNING;--HE DID NOT SPEAK LIKE HIMSELF,
AND DID NOT RETURN YOUR KINDNESS WITH ANY CORDIALITY.
BUT ALL THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY SUCH A SITUATION OF HIS
AFFAIRS AS YOU HAVE SUPPOSED.  HE HAD JUST PARTED FROM
MY SISTER, HAD SEEN HER LEAVE HIM IN THE GREATEST AFFLICTION;
AND IF HE FELT OBLIGED, FROM A FEAR OF OFFENDING MRS. SMITH,
TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF RETURNING HERE SOON, AND YET
AWARE THAT BY DECLINING YOUR INVITATION, BY SAYING
THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY FOR SOME TIME, HE SHOULD SEEM
TO ACT AN UNGENEROUS, A SUSPICIOUS PART BY OUR FAMILY,
BE MIGHT WELL BE EMBARRASSED AND DISTURBED.  IN SUCH A CASE,
A PLAIN AND OPEN AVOWAL OF HIS DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE TO HIS HONOUR I THINK, AS WELL AS MORE CONSISTENT
WITH HIS GENERAL CHARACTER;--BUT I WILL NOT RAISE OBJECTIONS
AGAINST ANY ONE'S CONDUCT ON SO ILLIBERAL A FOUNDATION,
AS A DIFFERENCE IN JUDGMENT FROM MYSELF, OR A DEVIATION FROM
WHAT I MAY THINK RIGHT AND CONSISTENT."

"YOU SPEAK VERY PROPERLY.  WILLOUGHBY CERTAINLY DOES
NOT DESERVE TO BE SUSPECTED.  THOUGH WE HAVE NOT KNOWN
HIM LONG, HE IS NO STRANGER IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD;
AND WHO HAS EVER SPOKEN TO HIS DISADVANTAGE?  HAD HE BEEN
IN A SITUATION TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND MARRY IMMEDIATELY,
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ODD THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE US WITHOUT
ACKNOWLEDGING EVERYTHING TO ME AT ONCE: BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE.
IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT IN SOME RESPECTS NOT PROSPEROUSLY BEGUN,
FOR THEIR MARRIAGE MUST BE AT A VERY UNCERTAIN DISTANCE;
AND EVEN SECRECY, AS FAR AS IT CAN BE OBSERVED, MAY NOW
BE VERY ADVISABLE."

THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTRANCE OF MARGARET;
AND ELINOR WAS THEN AT LIBERTY TO THINK OVER THE REPRESENTATIONS
OF HER MOTHER, TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBABILITY OF MANY,
AND HOPE FOR THE JUSTICE OF ALL.

THEY SAW NOTHING OF MARIANNE TILL DINNER TIME,
WHEN SHE ENTERED THE ROOM AND TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE
WITHOUT SAYING A WORD.  HER EYES WERE RED AND SWOLLEN;
AND IT SEEMED AS IF HER TEARS WERE EVEN THEN RESTRAINED
WITH DIFFICULTY.  SHE AVOIDED THE LOOKS OF THEM ALL,
COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SPEAK, AND AFTER SOME TIME, ON HER
MOTHER'S SILENTLY PRESSING HER HAND WITH TENDER COMPASSION,
HER SMALL DEGREE OF FORTITUDE WAS QUITE OVERCOME, SHE BURST
INTO TEARS AND LEFT THE ROOM.

THIS VIOLENT OPPRESSION OF SPIRITS CONTINUED THE
WHOLE EVENING.  SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY POWER, BECAUSE SHE
WAS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE OF COMMAND OVER HERSELF.
THE SLIGHTEST MENTION OF ANYTHING RELATIVE TO WILLOUGHBY
OVERPOWERED HER IN AN INSTANT; AND THOUGH HER FAMILY
WERE MOST ANXIOUSLY ATTENTIVE TO HER COMFORT, IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM, IF THEY SPOKE AT ALL, TO KEEP CLEAR
OF EVERY SUBJECT WHICH HER FEELINGS CONNECTED WITH HIM.



CHAPTER 16


MARIANNE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HERSELF VERY INEXCUSABLE
HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL THE FIRST NIGHT
AFTER PARTING FROM WILLOUGHBY.  SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN
ASHAMED TO LOOK HER FAMILY IN THE FACE THE NEXT MORNING,
HAD SHE NOT RISEN FROM HER BED IN MORE NEED OF REPOSE
THAN WHEN SHE LAY DOWN IN IT.  BUT THE FEELINGS WHICH
MADE SUCH COMPOSURE A DISGRACE, LEFT HER IN NO DANGER
OF INCURRING IT.  SHE WAS AWAKE THE WHOLE NIGHT, AND SHE
WEPT THE GREATEST PART OF IT.  SHE GOT UP WITH A HEADACHE,
WAS UNABLE TO TALK, AND UNWILLING TO TAKE ANY NOURISHMENT;
GIVING PAIN EVERY MOMENT TO HER MOTHER AND SISTERS,
AND FORBIDDING ALL ATTEMPT AT CONSOLATION FROM EITHER.
HER SENSIBILITY WAS POTENT ENOUGH!

WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER SHE WALKED OUT BY HERSELF,
AND WANDERED ABOUT THE VILLAGE OF ALLENHAM, INDULGING THE
RECOLLECTION OF PAST ENJOYMENT AND CRYING OVER THE PRESENT
REVERSE FOR THE CHIEF OF THE MORNING.

THE EVENING PASSED OFF IN THE EQUAL INDULGENCE OF FEELING.
SHE PLAYED OVER EVERY FAVOURITE SONG THAT SHE HAD BEEN USED
TO PLAY TO WILLOUGHBY, EVERY AIR IN WHICH THEIR VOICES
HAD BEEN OFTENEST JOINED, AND SAT AT THE INSTRUMENT GAZING
ON EVERY LINE OF MUSIC THAT HE HAD WRITTEN OUT FOR HER,
TILL HER HEART WAS SO HEAVY THAT NO FARTHER SADNESS
COULD BE GAINED; AND THIS NOURISHMENT OF GRIEF WAS EVERY
DAY APPLIED.  SHE SPENT WHOLE HOURS AT THE PIANOFORTE
ALTERNATELY SINGING AND CRYING; HER VOICE OFTEN TOTALLY
SUSPENDED BY HER TEARS.  IN BOOKS TOO, AS WELL AS IN MUSIC,
SHE COURTED THE MISERY WHICH A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE PAST
AND PRESENT WAS CERTAIN OF GIVING.  SHE READ NOTHING
BUT WHAT THEY HAD BEEN USED TO READ TOGETHER.

SUCH VIOLENCE OF AFFLICTION INDEED COULD NOT BE SUPPORTED
FOR EVER; IT SUNK WITHIN A FEW DAYS INTO A CALMER MELANCHOLY;
BUT THESE EMPLOYMENTS, TO WHICH SHE DAILY RECURRED,
HER SOLITARY WALKS AND SILENT MEDITATIONS, STILL PRODUCED
OCCASIONAL EFFUSIONS OF SORROW AS LIVELY AS EVER.

NO LETTER FROM WILLOUGHBY CAME; AND NONE SEEMED EXPECTED
BY MARIANNE.  HER MOTHER WAS SURPRISED, AND ELINOR AGAIN
BECAME UNEASY.  BUT MRS. DASHWOOD COULD FIND EXPLANATIONS
WHENEVER SHE WANTED THEM, WHICH AT LEAST SATISFIED HERSELF.

"REMEMBER, ELINOR," SAID SHE, "HOW VERY OFTEN SIR JOHN
FETCHES OUR LETTERS HIMSELF FROM THE POST, AND CARRIES THEM
TO IT.  WE HAVE ALREADY AGREED THAT SECRECY MAY BE NECESSARY,
AND WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT COULD NOT BE MAINTAINED IF
THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WERE TO PASS THROUGH SIR JOHN'S HANDS."

ELINOR COULD NOT DENY THE TRUTH OF THIS, AND SHE TRIED
TO FIND IN IT A MOTIVE SUFFICIENT FOR THEIR SILENCE.
BUT THERE WAS ONE METHOD SO DIRECT, SO SIMPLE, AND IN
HER OPINION SO ELIGIBLE OF KNOWING THE REAL STATE
OF THE AFFAIR, AND OF INSTANTLY REMOVING ALL MYSTERY,
THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP SUGGESTING IT TO HER MOTHER.

"WHY DO YOU NOT ASK MARIANNE AT ONCE," SAID SHE,
"WHETHER SHE IS OR SHE IS NOT ENGAGED TO WILLOUGHBY?  FROM YOU,
HER MOTHER, AND SO KIND, SO INDULGENT A MOTHER, THE QUESTION
COULD NOT GIVE OFFENCE.  IT WOULD BE THE NATURAL RESULT
OF YOUR AFFECTION FOR HER.  SHE USED TO BE ALL UNRESERVE,
AND TO YOU MORE ESPECIALLY."

"I WOULD NOT ASK SUCH A QUESTION FOR THE WORLD.
SUPPOSING IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE NOT ENGAGED,
WHAT DISTRESS WOULD NOT SUCH AN ENQUIRY INFLICT!  AT ANY
RATE IT WOULD BE MOST UNGENEROUS.  I SHOULD NEVER DESERVE
HER CONFIDENCE AGAIN, AFTER FORCING FROM HER A CONFESSION
OF WHAT IS MEANT AT PRESENT TO BE UNACKNOWLEDGED TO ANY ONE.
I KNOW MARIANNE'S HEART: I KNOW THAT SHE DEARLY LOVES ME,
AND THAT I SHALL NOT BE THE LAST TO WHOM THE AFFAIR IS MADE
KNOWN,
WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE THE REVEALMENT OF IT ELIGIBLE.
I WOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO FORCE THE CONFIDENCE OF ANY ONE;
OF A CHILD MUCH LESS; BECAUSE A SENSE OF DUTY WOULD PREVENT
THE DENIAL WHICH HER WISHES MIGHT DIRECT."

ELINOR THOUGHT THIS GENEROSITY OVERSTRAINED,
CONSIDERING HER SISTER'S YOUTH, AND URGED THE MATTER FARTHER,
BUT IN VAIN; COMMON SENSE, COMMON CARE, COMMON PRUDENCE,
WERE ALL SUNK IN MRS. DASHWOOD'S ROMANTIC DELICACY.

IT WAS SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE WILLOUGHBY'S NAME
WAS MENTIONED BEFORE MARIANNE BY ANY OF HER FAMILY;
SIR JOHN AND MRS. JENNINGS, INDEED, WERE NOT SO NICE;
THEIR WITTICISMS ADDED PAIN TO MANY A PAINFUL HOUR;--
BUT ONE EVENING, MRS. DASHWOOD, ACCIDENTALLY TAKING UP A
VOLUME OF SHAKESPEARE, EXCLAIMED,

"WE HAVE NEVER FINISHED HAMLET, MARIANNE; OUR DEAR
WILLOUGHBY WENT AWAY BEFORE WE COULD GET THROUGH IT.
WE WILL PUT IT BY, THAT WHEN HE COMES AGAIN...BUT IT MAY
BE MONTHS, PERHAPS, BEFORE THAT HAPPENS."

"MONTHS!" CRIED MARIANNE, WITH STRONG SURPRISE.
"NO--NOR MANY WEEKS."

MRS. DASHWOOD WAS SORRY FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID;
BUT IT GAVE ELINOR PLEASURE, AS IT PRODUCED A REPLY
FROM MARIANNE SO EXPRESSIVE OF CONFIDENCE IN WILLOUGHBY
AND KNOWLEDGE OF HIS INTENTIONS.

ONE MORNING, ABOUT A WEEK AFTER HIS LEAVING THE COUNTRY,
MARIANNE WAS PREVAILED ON TO JOIN HER SISTERS IN THEIR
USUAL WALK, INSTEAD OF WANDERING AWAY BY HERSELF.
HITHERTO SHE HAD CAREFULLY AVOIDED EVERY COMPANION IN
HER RAMBLES.  IF HER SISTERS INTENDED TO WALK ON THE DOWNS,
SHE DIRECTLY STOLE AWAY TOWARDS THE LANES; IF THEY TALKED
OF THE VALLEY, SHE WAS AS SPEEDY IN CLIMBING THE HILLS,
AND COULD NEVER BE FOUND WHEN THE OTHERS SET OFF.
BUT AT LENGTH SHE WAS SECURED BY THE EXERTIONS OF ELINOR,
WHO GREATLY DISAPPROVED SUCH CONTINUAL SECLUSION.  THEY WALKED
ALONG THE ROAD THROUGH THE VALLEY, AND CHIEFLY IN SILENCE,
FOR MARIANNE'S MIND COULD NOT BE CONTROLLED, AND ELINOR,
SATISFIED WITH GAINING ONE POINT, WOULD NOT THEN ATTEMPT MORE.
BEYOND THE ENTRANCE OF THE VALLEY, WHERE THE COUNTRY,
THOUGH STILL RICH, WAS LESS WILD AND MORE OPEN, A LONG
STRETCH OF THE ROAD WHICH THEY HAD TRAVELLED ON FIRST COMING
TO BARTON, LAY BEFORE THEM; AND ON REACHING THAT POINT,
THEY STOPPED TO LOOK AROUND THEM, AND EXAMINE A PROSPECT
WHICH FORMED THE DISTANCE OF THEIR VIEW FROM THE COTTAGE,
FROM A SPOT WHICH THEY HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO REACH IN ANY
OF THEIR WALKS BEFORE.

AMONGST THE OBJECTS IN THE SCENE, THEY SOON DISCOVERED
AN ANIMATED ONE; IT WAS A MAN ON HORSEBACK RIDING TOWARDS THEM.
IN A FEW MINUTES THEY COULD DISTINGUISH HIM TO BE A GENTLEMAN;
AND IN A MOMENT AFTERWARDS MARIANNE RAPTUROUSLY EXCLAIMED,

"IT IS HE; IT IS INDEED;--I KNOW IT IS!"--AND WAS
HASTENING TO MEET HIM, WHEN ELINOR CRIED OUT,

"INDEED, MARIANNE, I THINK YOU ARE MISTAKEN.  IT IS
NOT WILLOUGHBY.  THE PERSON IS NOT TALL ENOUGH FOR HIM,
AND HAS NOT HIS AIR."

"HE HAS, HE HAS," CRIED MARIANNE, "I AM SURE HE HAS.
HIS AIR, HIS COAT, HIS HORSE.  I KNEW HOW SOON HE WOULD COME."

SHE WALKED EAGERLY ON AS SHE SPOKE; AND ELINOR,
TO SCREEN MARIANNE FROM PARTICULARITY, AS SHE FELT ALMOST
CERTAIN OF ITS NOT BEING WILLOUGHBY, QUICKENED HER
PACE AND KEPT UP WITH HER.  THEY WERE SOON WITHIN
THIRTY YARDS OF THE GENTLEMAN.  MARIANNE LOOKED AGAIN;
HER HEART SUNK WITHIN HER; AND ABRUPTLY TURNING ROUND,
SHE WAS HURRYING BACK, WHEN THE VOICES OF BOTH HER SISTERS
WERE RAISED TO DETAIN HER; A THIRD, ALMOST AS WELL KNOWN
AS WILLOUGHBY'S, JOINED THEM IN BEGGING HER TO STOP,
AND SHE TURNED ROUND WITH SURPRISE TO SEE AND WELCOME
EDWARD FERRARS.

HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO COULD
AT THAT MOMENT BE FORGIVEN FOR NOT BEING WILLOUGHBY;
THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD HAVE GAINED A SMILE FROM HER;
BUT SHE DISPERSED HER TEARS TO SMILE ON HIM, AND IN HER
SISTER'S HAPPINESS FORGOT FOR A TIME HER OWN DISAPPOINTMENT.

HE DISMOUNTED, AND GIVING HIS HORSE TO HIS SERVANT,
WALKED BACK WITH THEM TO BARTON, WHITHER HE WAS PURPOSELY
COMING TO VISIT THEM.

HE WAS WELCOMED BY THEM ALL WITH GREAT CORDIALITY,
BUT ESPECIALLY BY MARIANNE, WHO SHOWED MORE WARMTH OF
REGARD IN HER RECEPTION OF HIM THAN EVEN ELINOR HERSELF.
TO MARIANNE, INDEED, THE MEETING BETWEEN EDWARD AND HER SISTER
WAS BUT A CONTINUATION OF THAT UNACCOUNTABLE COLDNESS WHICH SHE
HAD OFTEN OBSERVED AT NORLAND IN THEIR MUTUAL BEHAVIOUR.
ON EDWARD'S SIDE, MORE PARTICULARLY, THERE WAS A DEFICIENCY
OF ALL THAT A LOVER OUGHT TO LOOK AND SAY ON SUCH AN OCCASION.
HE WAS CONFUSED, SEEMED SCARCELY SENSIBLE OF PLEASURE
IN SEEING THEM, LOOKED NEITHER RAPTUROUS NOR GAY,
SAID LITTLE BUT WHAT WAS FORCED FROM HIM BY QUESTIONS,
AND DISTINGUISHED ELINOR BY NO MARK OF AFFECTION.
MARIANNE SAW AND LISTENED WITH INCREASING SURPRISE.
SHE BEGAN ALMOST TO FEEL A DISLIKE OF EDWARD; AND IT ENDED,
AS EVERY FEELING MUST END WITH HER, BY CARRYING BACK HER
THOUGHTS TO WILLOUGHBY, WHOSE MANNERS FORMED A CONTRAST
SUFFICIENTLY STRIKING TO THOSE OF HIS BROTHER ELECT.

AFTER A SHORT SILENCE WHICH SUCCEEDED THE FIRST
SURPRISE AND ENQUIRIES OF MEETING, MARIANNE ASKED
EDWARD IF HE CAME DIRECTLY FROM LONDON.  NO, HE HAD
BEEN IN DEVONSHIRE A FORTNIGHT.

"A FORTNIGHT!" SHE REPEATED, SURPRISED AT HIS BEING
SO LONG IN THE SAME COUNTY WITH ELINOR WITHOUT SEEING
HER BEFORE.

HE LOOKED RATHER DISTRESSED AS HE ADDED, THAT HE
HAD BEEN STAYING WITH SOME FRIENDS NEAR PLYMOUTH.

"HAVE YOU BEEN LATELY IN SUSSEX?" SAID ELINOR.

"I WAS AT NORLAND ABOUT A MONTH AGO."

"AND HOW DOES DEAR, DEAR NORLAND LOOK?" CRIED MARIANNE.

"DEAR, DEAR NORLAND," SAID ELINOR, "PROBABLY LOOKS
MUCH AS IT ALWAYS DOES AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.
THE WOODS AND WALKS THICKLY COVERED WITH DEAD LEAVES."

"OH," CRIED MARIANNE, "WITH WHAT TRANSPORTING SENSATION
HAVE I FORMERLY SEEN THEM FALL!  HOW HAVE I DELIGHTED,
AS I WALKED, TO SEE THEM DRIVEN IN SHOWERS ABOUT ME
BY THE WIND!  WHAT FEELINGS HAVE THEY, THE SEASON, THE AIR
ALTOGETHER INSPIRED!  NOW THERE IS NO ONE TO REGARD THEM.
THEY ARE SEEN ONLY AS A NUISANCE, SWEPT HASTILY OFF,
AND DRIVEN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM THE SIGHT."

"IT IS NOT EVERY ONE," SAID ELINOR, "WHO HAS YOUR
PASSION FOR DEAD LEAVES."

"NO; MY FEELINGS ARE NOT OFTEN SHARED, NOT OFTEN
UNDERSTOOD.  BUT SOMETIMES THEY ARE."--AS SHE SAID THIS,
SHE SUNK INTO A REVERIE FOR A FEW MOMENTS;--BUT ROUSING
HERSELF AGAIN, "NOW, EDWARD," SAID SHE, CALLING HIS ATTENTION
TO THE PROSPECT, "HERE IS BARTON VALLEY.  LOOK UP TO IT,
AND BE TRANQUIL IF YOU CAN.  LOOK AT THOSE HILLS!
DID YOU EVER SEE THEIR EQUALS?  TO THE LEFT IS BARTON PARK,
AMONGST THOSE WOODS AND PLANTATIONS.  YOU MAY SEE THE END
OF THE HOUSE.  AND THERE, BENEATH THAT FARTHEST HILL,
WHICH RISES WITH SUCH GRANDEUR, IS OUR COTTAGE."

"IT IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY," HE REPLIED; "BUT THESE
BOTTOMS MUST BE DIRTY IN WINTER."

"HOW CAN YOU THINK OF DIRT, WITH SUCH OBJECTS BEFORE YOU?"

"BECAUSE," REPLIED HE, SMILING, "AMONG THE REST OF THE
OBJECTS BEFORE ME, I SEE A VERY DIRTY LANE."

"HOW STRANGE!" SAID MARIANNE TO HERSELF AS SHE WALKED ON.

"HAVE YOU AN AGREEABLE NEIGHBOURHOOD HERE?  ARE THE
MIDDLETONS PLEASANT PEOPLE?"

"NO, NOT ALL," ANSWERED MARIANNE; "WE COULD NOT
BE MORE UNFORTUNATELY SITUATED."

"MARIANNE," CRIED HER SISTER, "HOW CAN YOU SAY SO? HOW CAN
YOU BE SO UNJUST?  THEY ARE A VERY RESPECTABLE FAMILY, MR.
FERRARS;
AND TOWARDS US HAVE BEHAVED IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER.  HAVE YOU
FORGOT, MARIANNE, HOW MANY PLEASANT DAYS WE HAVE OWED TO THEM?"

"NO," SAID MARIANNE, IN A LOW VOICE, "NOR HOW MANY
PAINFUL MOMENTS."

ELINOR TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS; AND DIRECTING
HER ATTENTION TO THEIR VISITOR, ENDEAVOURED TO SUPPORT
SOMETHING LIKE DISCOURSE WITH HIM, BY TALKING OF THEIR
PRESENT RESIDENCE, ITS CONVENIENCES, &C. EXTORTING FROM HIM
OCCASIONAL QUESTIONS AND REMARKS.  HIS COLDNESS AND RESERVE
MORTIFIED HER SEVERELY; SHE WAS VEXED AND HALF ANGRY;
BUT RESOLVING TO REGULATE HER BEHAVIOUR TO HIM BY THE PAST
RATHER THAN THE PRESENT, SHE AVOIDED EVERY APPEARANCE
OF RESENTMENT OR DISPLEASURE, AND TREATED HIM AS SHE
THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO BE TREATED FROM THE FAMILY CONNECTION.



CHAPTER 17


MRS. DASHWOOD WAS SURPRISED ONLY FOR A MOMENT AT
SEEING HIM; FOR HIS COMING TO BARTON WAS, IN HER OPINION,
OF ALL THINGS THE MOST NATURAL.  HER JOY AND EXPRESSION
OF REGARD LONG OUTLIVED HER WONDER.  HE RECEIVED THE KINDEST
WELCOME FROM HER; AND SHYNESS, COLDNESS, RESERVE COULD NOT
STAND AGAINST SUCH A RECEPTION.  THEY HAD BEGUN TO FAIL HIM
BEFORE HE ENTERED THE HOUSE, AND THEY WERE QUITE OVERCOME
BY THE CAPTIVATING MANNERS OF MRS. DASHWOOD.  INDEED A MAN
COULD NOT VERY WELL BE IN LOVE WITH EITHER OF HER DAUGHTERS,
WITHOUT EXTENDING THE PASSION TO HER; AND ELINOR HAD THE
SATISFACTION OF SEEING HIM SOON BECOME MORE LIKE HIMSELF.
HIS AFFECTIONS SEEMED TO REANIMATE TOWARDS THEM ALL,
AND HIS INTEREST IN THEIR WELFARE AGAIN BECAME PERCEPTIBLE.
HE WAS NOT IN SPIRITS, HOWEVER; HE PRAISED THEIR HOUSE,
ADMIRED ITS PROSPECT, WAS ATTENTIVE, AND KIND; BUT STILL
HE WAS NOT IN SPIRITS.  THE WHOLE FAMILY PERCEIVED IT,
AND MRS. DASHWOOD, ATTRIBUTING IT TO SOME WANT OF LIBERALITY
IN HIS MOTHER, SAT DOWN TO TABLE INDIGNANT AGAINST ALL
SELFISH PARENTS.

"WHAT ARE MRS. FERRARS'S VIEWS FOR YOU AT PRESENT, EDWARD?"
SAID SHE, WHEN DINNER WAS OVER AND THEY HAD DRAWN ROUND
THE FIRE; "ARE YOU STILL TO BE A GREAT ORATOR IN SPITE OF
YOURSELF?"

"NO. I HOPE MY MOTHER IS NOW CONVINCED THAT I HAVE
NO MORE TALENTS THAN INCLINATION FOR A PUBLIC LIFE!"

"BUT HOW IS YOUR FAME TO BE ESTABLISHED? FOR FAMOUS YOU
MUST BE TO SATISFY ALL YOUR FAMILY; AND WITH NO INCLINATION
FOR EXPENSE, NO AFFECTION FOR STRANGERS, NO PROFESSION,
AND NO ASSURANCE, YOU MAY FIND IT A DIFFICULT MATTER."

"I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT IT.  I HAVE NO WISH TO BE
DISTINGUISHED; AND HAVE EVERY REASON TO HOPE I NEVER SHALL.
THANK HEAVEN! I CANNOT BE FORCED INTO GENIUS AND ELOQUENCE."

"YOU HAVE NO AMBITION, I WELL KNOW.  YOUR WISHES
ARE ALL MODERATE."

"AS MODERATE AS THOSE OF THE REST OF THE WORLD,
I BELIEVE.  I WISH AS WELL AS EVERY BODY ELSE TO BE
PERFECTLY HAPPY; BUT, LIKE EVERY BODY ELSE IT MUST BE
IN MY OWN WAY.  GREATNESS WILL NOT MAKE ME SO."

"STRANGE THAT IT WOULD!" CRIED MARIANNE.  "WHAT HAVE
WEALTH OR GRANDEUR TO DO WITH HAPPINESS?"

"GRANDEUR HAS BUT LITTLE," SAID ELINOR, "BUT WEALTH
HAS MUCH TO DO WITH IT."

"ELINOR, FOR SHAME!" SAID MARIANNE, "MONEY CAN ONLY
GIVE HAPPINESS WHERE THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO GIVE IT.
BEYOND A COMPETENCE, IT CAN AFFORD NO REAL SATISFACTION,
AS FAR AS MERE SELF IS CONCERNED."

"PERHAPS," SAID ELINOR, SMILING, "WE MAY COME
TO THE SAME POINT.  YOUR COMPETENCE AND MY WEALTH
ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE, I DARE SAY; AND WITHOUT THEM,
AS THE WORLD GOES NOW, WE SHALL BOTH AGREE THAT EVERY
KIND OF EXTERNAL COMFORT MUST BE WANTING.  YOUR IDEAS
ARE ONLY MORE NOBLE THAN MINE.  COME, WHAT IS YOUR COMPETENCE?"

"ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OR TWO THOUSAND A YEAR;
NOT MORE THAN THAT."

ELINOR LAUGHED.  "TWO THOUSAND A YEAR! ONE IS MY
WEALTH! I GUESSED HOW IT WOULD END."

"AND YET TWO THOUSAND A-YEAR IS A VERY MODERATE INCOME,"
SAID MARIANNE.  "A FAMILY CANNOT WELL BE MAINTAINED ON
A SMALLER.  I AM SURE I AM NOT EXTRAVAGANT IN MY DEMANDS.
A PROPER ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS, A CARRIAGE, PERHAPS TWO,
AND HUNTERS, CANNOT BE SUPPORTED ON LESS."

ELINOR SMILED AGAIN, TO HEAR HER SISTER DESCRIBING
SO ACCURATELY THEIR FUTURE EXPENSES AT COMBE MAGNA.

"HUNTERS!" REPEATED EDWARD--"BUT WHY MUST YOU HAVE
HUNTERS?  EVERY BODY DOES NOT HUNT."

MARIANNE COLOURED AS SHE REPLIED, "BUT MOST PEOPLE DO."

"I WISH," SAID MARGARET, STRIKING OUT A NOVEL THOUGHT,
"THAT SOMEBODY WOULD GIVE US ALL A LARGE FORTUNE APIECE!"

"OH THAT THEY WOULD!" CRIED MARIANNE, HER EYES
SPARKLING WITH ANIMATION, AND HER CHEEKS GLOWING
WITH THE DELIGHT OF SUCH IMAGINARY HAPPINESS.

"WE ARE ALL UNANIMOUS IN THAT WISH, I SUPPOSE,"
SAID ELINOR, "IN SPITE OF THE INSUFFICIENCY OF WEALTH."

"OH DEAR!" CRIED MARGARET, "HOW HAPPY I SHOULD BE!
I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH IT!"

MARIANNE LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD NO DOUBT ON THAT POINT.

"I SHOULD BE PUZZLED TO SPEND SO LARGE A FORTUNE MYSELF,"
SAID MRS. DASHWOOD, "IF MY CHILDREN WERE ALL TO BE RICH
MY HELP."

"YOU MUST BEGIN YOUR IMPROVEMENTS ON THIS HOUSE,"
OBSERVED ELINOR, "AND YOUR DIFFICULTIES WILL SOON VANISH."

"WHAT MAGNIFICENT ORDERS WOULD TRAVEL FROM THIS FAMILY
TO LONDON," SAID EDWARD, "IN SUCH AN EVENT!  WHAT A HAPPY
DAY FOR BOOKSELLERS, MUSIC-SELLERS, AND PRINT-SHOPS!  YOU,
MISS DASHWOOD, WOULD GIVE A GENERAL COMMISSION FOR EVERY
NEW PRINT OF MERIT TO BE SENT YOU--AND AS FOR MARIANNE,
I KNOW HER GREATNESS OF SOUL, THERE WOULD NOT BE MUSIC ENOUGH
IN LONDON TO CONTENT HER.  AND BOOKS!--THOMSON, COWPER,
SCOTT--SHE WOULD BUY THEM ALL OVER AND OVER AGAIN: SHE
WOULD BUY UP EVERY COPY, I BELIEVE, TO PREVENT THEIR
FALLING INTO UNWORTHY HANDS; AND SHE WOULD HAVE EVERY
BOOK THAT TELLS HER HOW TO ADMIRE AN OLD TWISTED TREE.
SHOULD NOT YOU, MARIANNE?  FORGIVE ME, IF I AM VERY SAUCY.
BUT I WAS WILLING TO SHEW YOU THAT I HAD NOT FORGOT OUR
OLD DISPUTES."

"I LOVE TO BE REMINDED OF THE PAST, EDWARD--WHETHER IT
BE MELANCHOLY OR GAY, I LOVE TO RECALL IT--AND YOU
WILL NEVER OFFEND ME BY TALKING OF FORMER TIMES.
YOU ARE VERY RIGHT IN SUPPOSING HOW MY MONEY WOULD BE
SPENT--SOME OF IT, AT LEAST--MY LOOSE CASH WOULD CERTAINLY
BE EMPLOYED IN IMPROVING MY COLLECTION OF MUSIC AND BOOKS."

"AND THE BULK OF YOUR FORTUNE WOULD BE LAID OUT
IN ANNUITIES ON THE AUTHORS OR THEIR HEIRS."

"NO, EDWARD, I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO
WITH IT."

"PERHAPS, THEN, YOU WOULD BESTOW IT AS A REWARD ON THAT
PERSON WHO WROTE THE ABLEST DEFENCE OF YOUR FAVOURITE MAXIM,
THAT NO ONE CAN EVER BE IN LOVE MORE THAN ONCE IN THEIR
LIFE--YOUR OPINION ON THAT POINT IS UNCHANGED, I PRESUME?"

"UNDOUBTEDLY. AT MY TIME OF LIFE OPINIONS ARE TOLERABLY FIXED.
IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT I SHOULD NOW SEE OR HEAR ANY THING TO
CHANGE THEM."

"MARIANNE IS AS STEADFAST AS EVER, YOU SEE," SAID ELINOR,
"SHE IS NOT AT ALL ALTERED."

"SHE IS ONLY GROWN A LITTLE MORE GRAVE THAN SHE WAS."

"NAY, EDWARD," SAID MARIANNE, "YOU NEED NOT REPROACH ME.
YOU ARE NOT VERY GAY YOURSELF."

"WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO!" REPLIED HE, WITH A SIGH.
"BUT GAIETY NEVER WAS A PART OF MY CHARACTER."

"NOR DO I THINK IT A PART OF MARIANNE'S," SAID ELINOR;
"I SHOULD HARDLY CALL HER A LIVELY GIRL--SHE IS VERY EARNEST,
VERY EAGER IN ALL SHE DOES--SOMETIMES TALKS A GREAT DEAL
AND ALWAYS WITH ANIMATION--BUT SHE IS NOT OFTEN REALLY MERRY."

"I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT," HE REPLIED, "AND YET I
HAVE ALWAYS SET HER DOWN AS A LIVELY GIRL."

"I HAVE FREQUENTLY DETECTED MYSELF IN SUCH KIND OF MISTAKES,"
SAID ELINOR, "IN A TOTAL MISAPPREHENSION OF CHARACTER IN SOME
POINT OR OTHER: FANCYING PEOPLE SO MUCH MORE GAY OR GRAVE,
OR INGENIOUS OR STUPID THAN THEY REALLY ARE, AND I CAN
HARDLY TELL WHY OR IN WHAT THE DECEPTION ORIGINATED.
SOMETIMES ONE IS GUIDED BY WHAT THEY SAY OF THEMSELVES,
AND VERY FREQUENTLY BY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY OF THEM,
WITHOUT GIVING ONESELF TIME TO DELIBERATE AND JUDGE."

"BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS RIGHT, ELINOR," SAID MARIANNE,
"TO BE GUIDED WHOLLY BY THE OPINION OF OTHER PEOPLE.
I THOUGHT OUR JUDGMENTS WERE GIVEN US MERELY TO BE SUBSERVIENT
TO THOSE OF NEIGHBOURS.  THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN YOUR DOCTRINE,
I AM SURE."

"NO, MARIANNE, NEVER.  MY DOCTRINE HAS NEVER AIMED
AT THE SUBJECTION OF THE UNDERSTANDING.  ALL I HAVE
EVER ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE HAS BEEN THE BEHAVIOUR.
YOU MUST NOT CONFOUND MY MEANING.  I AM GUILTY, I CONFESS,
OF HAVING OFTEN WISHED YOU TO TREAT OUR ACQUAINTANCE
IN GENERAL WITH GREATER ATTENTION; BUT WHEN HAVE I ADVISED
YOU TO ADOPT THEIR SENTIMENTS OR TO CONFORM TO THEIR
JUDGMENT IN SERIOUS MATTERS?"

"YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING YOUR SISTER OVER TO YOUR
PLAN OF GENERAL CIVILITY," SAID EDWARD TO ELINOR, "DO YOU GAIN
NO GROUND?"

"QUITE THE CONTRARY," REPLIED ELINOR,
LOOKING EXPRESSIVELY AT MARIANNE.

"MY JUDGMENT," HE RETURNED, "IS ALL ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE QUESTION; BUT I AM AFRAID MY PRACTICE IS MUCH
MORE ON YOUR SISTER'S.  I NEVER WISH TO OFFEND, BUT I
AM SO FOOLISHLY SHY, THAT I OFTEN SEEM NEGLIGENT,
WHEN I AM ONLY KEPT BACK BY MY NATURAL AWKWARDNESS.
I HAVE FREQUENTLY THOUGHT THAT I MUST HAVE BEEN INTENDED
BY NATURE TO BE FOND OF LOW COMPANY, I AM SO LITTLE AT
MY EASE AMONG STRANGERS OF GENTILITY!"

"MARIANNE HAS NOT SHYNESS TO EXCUSE ANY INATTENTION
OF HERS," SAID ELINOR.

"SHE KNOWS HER OWN WORTH TOO WELL FOR FALSE SHAME,"
REPLIED EDWARD.  "SHYNESS IS ONLY THE EFFECT OF A SENSE
OF INFERIORITY IN SOME WAY OR OTHER.  IF I COULD PERSUADE
MYSELF THAT MY MANNERS WERE PERFECTLY EASY AND GRACEFUL,
I SHOULD NOT BE SHY."

"BUT YOU WOULD STILL BE RESERVED," SAID MARIANNE,
"AND THAT IS WORSE."

EDWARD STARTED--"RESERVED! AM I RESERVED, MARIANNE?"

"YES, VERY."

"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU," REPLIED HE, COLOURING.
"RESERVED!--HOW, IN WHAT MANNER?  WHAT AM I TO TELL YOU?
WHAT CAN YOU SUPPOSE?"

ELINOR LOOKED SURPRISED AT HIS EMOTION; BUT TRYING
TO LAUGH OFF THE SUBJECT, SHE SAID TO HIM, "DO NOT YOU
KNOW MY SISTER WELL ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE MEANS?
DO NOT YOU KNOW SHE CALLS EVERY ONE RESERVED WHO DOES NOT
TALK AS FAST, AND ADMIRE WHAT SHE ADMIRES AS RAPTUROUSLY
AS HERSELF?"

EDWARD MADE NO ANSWER.  HIS GRAVITY AND THOUGHTFULNESS
RETURNED ON HIM IN THEIR FULLEST EXTENT--AND HE SAT
FOR SOME TIME SILENT AND DULL.



CHAPTER 18


ELINOR SAW, WITH GREAT UNEASINESS THE LOW SPIRITS
OF HER FRIEND.  HIS VISIT AFFORDED HER BUT A VERY
PARTIAL SATISFACTION, WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT
APPEARED SO IMPERFECT.  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY;
SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL
DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE
SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING; BUT HITHERTO THE
CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN;
AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED
ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING
ONE.

HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST-ROOM
THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN; AND MARIANNE,
WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR
AS SHE COULD, SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES.  BUT BEFORE SHE
WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN, AND,
TURNING ROUND, WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE EDWARD HIMSELF COME OUT.

"I AM GOING INTO THE VILLAGE TO SEE MY HORSES,"
SAID BE, "AS YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR BREAKFAST; I SHALL
BE BACK AGAIN PRESENTLY."

                    ***

EDWARD RETURNED TO THEM WITH FRESH ADMIRATION
OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY; IN HIS WALK TO THE VILLAGE,
HE HAD SEEN MANY PARTS OF THE VALLEY TO ADVANTAGE;
AND THE VILLAGE ITSELF, IN A MUCH HIGHER SITUATION THAN
THE COTTAGE, AFFORDED A GENERAL VIEW OF THE WHOLE, WHICH HAD
EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED HIM.  THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED
MARIANNE'S ATTENTION, AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE
HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES, AND TO QUESTION HIM MORE
MINUTELY ON THE OBJECTS THAT HAD PARTICULARLY STRUCK HIM,
WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING, "YOU MUST NOT
ENQUIRE TOO FAR, MARIANNE--REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE
IN THE PICTURESQUE, AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE
AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS.  I SHALL CALL
HILLS STEEP, WHICH OUGHT TO BE BOLD; SURFACES STRANGE
AND UNCOUTH, WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED;
AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT, WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE
INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE.
YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN
HONESTLY GIVE.  I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY--THE
HILLS ARE STEEP, THE WOODS SEEM FULL OF FINE TIMBER,
AND THE VALLEY LOOKS COMFORTABLE AND SNUG--WITH RICH
MEADOWS AND SEVERAL NEAT FARM HOUSES SCATTERED HERE
AND THERE.  IT EXACTLY ANSWERS MY IDEA OF A FINE COUNTRY,
BECAUSE IT UNITES BEAUTY WITH UTILITY--AND I DARE SAY IT
IS A PICTURESQUE ONE TOO, BECAUSE YOU ADMIRE IT; I CAN
EASILY BELIEVE IT TO BE FULL OF ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES,
GREY MOSS AND BRUSH WOOD, BUT THESE ARE ALL LOST ON ME.
I KNOW NOTHING OF THE PICTURESQUE."

"I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE," SAID MARIANNE;
"BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT?"

"I SUSPECT," SAID ELINOR, "THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND
OF AFFECTATION, EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER.  BECAUSE HE
BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES
OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL, AND IS DISGUSTED WITH
SUCH PRETENSIONS, HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS
DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES.
HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN."

"IT IS VERY TRUE," SAID MARIANNE, "THAT ADMIRATION
OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY IS BECOME A MERE JARGON.
EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH
THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT
PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS.  I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND,
AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF,
BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM
IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING."

"I AM CONVINCED," SAID EDWARD, "THAT YOU REALLY FEEL
ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS
TO FEEL.  BUT, IN RETURN, YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME
TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS.  I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT,
BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES.  I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED,
TWISTED, BLASTED TREES.  I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY
ARE TALL, STRAIGHT, AND FLOURISHING.  I DO NOT LIKE RUINED,
TATTERED COTTAGES.  I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES,
OR HEATH BLOSSOMS.  I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG
FARM-HOUSE THAN A WATCH-TOWER--AND A TROOP OF TIDY,
HAPPY VILLAGES PLEASE ME BETTER THAN THE FINEST BANDITTI
IN THE WORLD."

MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD,
WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER.  ELINOR ONLY LAUGHED.

THE SUBJECT WAS CONTINUED NO FARTHER; AND MARIANNE
REMAINED THOUGHTFULLY SILENT, TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY
ENGAGED HER ATTENTION.  SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD, AND
IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MRS. DASHWOOD, HIS HAND PASSED
SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER, AS TO MAKE A RING, WITH A PLAIT
OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE, VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS.

"I NEVER SAW YOU WEAR A RING BEFORE, EDWARD," SHE CRIED.
"IS THAT FANNY'S HAIR? I REMEMBER HER PROMISING TO GIVE
YOU SOME.  BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER HAIR HAD BEEN DARKER."

MARIANNE SPOKE INCONSIDERATELY WHAT SHE REALLY FELT--
BUT WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH SHE HAD PAINED EDWARD, HER OWN
VEXATION AT HER WANT OF THOUGHT COULD NOT BE SURPASSED
BY HIS.  HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY, AND GIVING A MOMENTARY
GLANCE AT ELINOR, REPLIED, "YES; IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR.
THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT,
YOU KNOW."

ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE, AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE.
THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN, SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS
WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE; THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR
CONCLUSIONS WAS, THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE
GIFT FROM HER SISTER, ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN
PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF.
SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR, HOWEVER, TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT,
AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED,
BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE, SHE INTERNALLY
RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING
THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF, BEYOND ALL DOUBT,
THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN.

EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME, AND IT
ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED.
HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING.
MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID;
BUT HER OWN FORGIVENESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE SPEEDY,
HAD SHE KNOWN HOW LITTLE OFFENCE IT HAD GIVEN HER SISTER.

BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR
JOHN AND MRS. JENNINGS, WHO, HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL
OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE, CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY
OF THE GUEST.  WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW,
SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING THAT THE NAME OF
FERRARS BEGAN WITH AN F. AND THIS PREPARED A FUTURE MINE
OF RAILLERY AGAINST THE DEVOTED ELINOR, WHICH NOTHING BUT
THE NEWNESS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD COULD HAVE
PREVENTED FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG.  BUT, AS IT WAS,
SHE ONLY LEARNED, FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS, HOW FAR
THEIR PENETRATION, FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS, EXTENDED.

SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER
INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY, OR TO DRINK
TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING.  ON THE PRESENT OCCASION,
FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR, TOWARDS
WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE,
HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH.

"YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT," SAID HE,
"FOR WE SHALL BE QUITE ALONE--AND TOMORROW YOU MUST
ABSOLUTELY DINE WITH US, FOR WE SHALL BE A LARGE PARTY."

MRS. JENNINGS ENFORCED THE NECESSITY.  "AND WHO KNOWS
BUT YOU MAY RAISE A DANCE," SAID SHE.  "AND THAT WILL
TEMPT YOU, MISS MARIANNE."

"A DANCE!" CRIED MARIANNE.  "IMPOSSIBLE! WHO IS TO DANCE?"

"WHO! WHY YOURSELVES, AND THE CAREYS, AND WHITAKERS
TO BE SURE.--WHAT! YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE
BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE!"

"I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL," CRIED SIR JOHN,
"THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN."

THIS, AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING, GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS
TO EDWARD.  "AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY?" SAID HE, IN A LOW VOICE,
TO MISS DASHWOOD, BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING.

SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY.  MARIANNE'S COUNTENANCE
WAS MORE COMMUNICATIVE.  EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND,
NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS, BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S
EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE; AND WHEN THEIR
VISITORS LEFT THEM, HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER, AND SAID,
IN A WHISPER, "I HAVE BEEN GUESSING.  SHALL I TELL YOU
MY GUESS?"

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

"SHALL I TELL YOU."

"CERTAINLY."

"WELL THEN; I GUESS THAT MR. WILLOUGHBY HUNTS."

MARIANNE WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED, YET SHE COULD
NOT HELP SMILING AT THE QUIET ARCHNESS OF HIS MANNER,
AND AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE, SAID,

"OH, EDWARD! HOW CAN YOU?--BUT THE TIME WILL COME
I HOPE...I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM."

"I DO NOT DOUBT IT," REPLIED HE, RATHER ASTONISHED
AT HER EARNESTNESS AND WARMTH; FOR HAD HE NOT IMAGINED IT
TO BE A JOKE FOR THE GOOD OF HER ACQUAINTANCE IN GENERAL,
FOUNDED ONLY ON A SOMETHING OR A NOTHING BETWEEN MR. WILLOUGHBY
AND HERSELF, HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO MENTION IT.



CHAPTER 19


EDWARD REMAINED A WEEK AT THE COTTAGE; HE WAS EARNESTLY
PRESSED BY MRS. DASHWOOD TO STAY LONGER; BUT, AS IF HE
WERE BENT ONLY ON SELF-MORTIFICATION, HE SEEMED RESOLVED
TO BE GONE WHEN HIS ENJOYMENT AMONG HIS FRIENDS WAS AT
THE HEIGHT.  HIS SPIRITS, DURING THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS,
THOUGH STILL VERY UNEQUAL, WERE GREATLY IMPROVED--HE GREW
MORE AND MORE PARTIAL TO THE HOUSE AND ENVIRONS--NEVER
SPOKE OF GOING AWAY WITHOUT A SIGH--DECLARED HIS TIME
TO BE WHOLLY DISENGAGED--EVEN DOUBTED TO WHAT PLACE HE
SHOULD GO WHEN HE LEFT THEM--BUT STILL, GO HE MUST.
NEVER HAD ANY WEEK PASSED SO QUICKLY--HE COULD HARDLY
BELIEVE IT TO BE GONE.  HE SAID SO REPEATEDLY; OTHER THINGS
HE SAID TOO, WHICH MARKED THE TURN OF HIS FEELINGS AND GAVE
THE LIE TO HIS ACTIONS.  HE HAD NO PLEASURE AT NORLAND;
HE DETESTED BEING IN TOWN; BUT EITHER TO NORLAND OR LONDON,
HE MUST GO.  HE VALUED THEIR KINDNESS BEYOND ANY THING,
AND HIS GREATEST HAPPINESS WAS IN BEING WITH THEM.
YET, HE MUST LEAVE THEM AT THE END OF A WEEK, IN SPITE
OF THEIR WISHES AND HIS OWN, AND WITHOUT ANY RESTRAINT
ON HIS TIME.

ELINOR PLACED ALL THAT WAS ASTONISHING IN THIS
WAY OF ACTING TO HIS MOTHER'S ACCOUNT; AND IT WAS
HAPPY FOR HER THAT HE HAD A MOTHER WHOSE CHARACTER
WAS SO IMPERFECTLY KNOWN TO HER, AS TO BE THE GENERAL
EXCUSE FOR EVERY THING STRANGE ON THE PART OF HER SON.
DISAPPOINTED, HOWEVER, AND VEXED AS SHE WAS, AND SOMETIMES
DISPLEASED WITH HIS UNCERTAIN BEHAVIOUR TO HERSELF,
SHE WAS VERY WELL DISPOSED ON THE WHOLE TO REGARD HIS ACTIONS
WITH ALL THE CANDID ALLOWANCES AND GENEROUS QUALIFICATIONS,
WHICH HAD BEEN RATHER MORE PAINFULLY EXTORTED FROM HER,
FOR WILLOUGHBY'S SERVICE, BY HER MOTHER.  HIS WANT OF SPIRITS,
OF OPENNESS, AND OF CONSISTENCY, WERE MOST USUALLY
ATTRIBUTED TO HIS WANT OF INDEPENDENCE, AND HIS BETTER
KNOWLEDGE OF MRS. FERRARS'S DISPOSITION AND DESIGNS.
THE SHORTNESS OF HIS VISIT, THE STEADINESS OF HIS PURPOSE
IN LEAVING THEM, ORIGINATED IN THE SAME FETTERED INCLINATION,
THE SAME INEVITABLE NECESSITY OF TEMPORIZING WITH HIS MOTHER.
THE OLD WELL-ESTABLISHED GRIEVANCE OF DUTY AGAINST WILL,
PARENT AGAINST CHILD, WAS THE CAUSE OF ALL.  SHE WOULD HAVE
BEEN GLAD TO KNOW WHEN THESE DIFFICULTIES WERE TO CEASE,
THIS OPPOSITION WAS TO YIELD,--WHEN MRS. FERRARS WOULD
BE REFORMED, AND HER SON BE AT LIBERTY TO BE HAPPY.
BUT FROM SUCH VAIN WISHES SHE WAS FORCED TO TURN FOR COMFORT
TO THE RENEWAL OF HER CONFIDENCE IN EDWARD'S AFFECTION,
TO THE REMEMBRANCE OF EVERY MARK OF REGARD IN LOOK OR WORD
WHICH FELL FROM HIM WHILE AT BARTON, AND ABOVE ALL
TO THAT FLATTERING PROOF OF IT WHICH HE CONSTANTLY WORE
ROUND HIS FINGER.

"I THINK, EDWARD," SAID MRS. DASHWOOD, AS THEY WERE
AT BREAKFAST THE LAST MORNING, "YOU WOULD BE A HAPPIER MAN
IF YOU HAD ANY PROFESSION TO ENGAGE YOUR TIME AND GIVE
AN INTEREST TO YOUR PLANS AND ACTIONS.  SOME INCONVENIENCE
TO YOUR FRIENDS, INDEED, MIGHT RESULT FROM IT--YOU
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM SO MUCH OF YOUR TIME.
BUT (WITH A SMILE) YOU WOULD BE MATERIALLY BENEFITED
IN ONE PARTICULAR AT LEAST--YOU WOULD KNOW WHERE TO GO
WHEN YOU LEFT THEM."

"I DO ASSURE YOU," HE REPLIED, "THAT I HAVE LONG
THOUGHT ON THIS POINT, AS YOU THINK NOW.  IT HAS BEEN,
AND IS, AND PROBABLY WILL ALWAYS BE A HEAVY MISFORTUNE
TO ME, THAT I HAVE HAD NO NECESSARY BUSINESS TO ENGAGE ME,
NO PROFESSION TO GIVE ME EMPLOYMENT, OR AFFORD ME ANY
THING LIKE INDEPENDENCE.  BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY OWN NICETY,
AND THE NICETY OF MY FRIENDS, HAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM,
AN IDLE, HELPLESS BEING.  WE NEVER COULD AGREE IN OUR
CHOICE OF A PROFESSION.  I ALWAYS PREFERRED THE CHURCH,
AS I STILL DO.  BUT THAT WAS NOT SMART ENOUGH FOR MY FAMILY.
THEY RECOMMENDED THE ARMY.  THAT WAS A GREAT DEAL
TOO SMART FOR ME.  THE LAW WAS ALLOWED TO BE GENTEEL
ENOUGH; MANY YOUNG MEN, WHO HAD CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPLE,
MADE A VERY GOOD APPEARANCE IN THE FIRST CIRCLES,
AND DROVE ABOUT TOWN IN VERY KNOWING GIGS.  BUT I HAD
NO INCLINATION FOR THE LAW, EVEN IN THIS LESS ABSTRUSE
STUDY OF IT, WHICH MY FAMILY APPROVED.  AS FOR THE NAVY,
IT HAD FASHION ON ITS SIDE, BUT I WAS TOO OLD WHEN THE
SUBJECT WAS FIRST STARTED TO ENTER IT--AND, AT LENGTH,
AS THERE WAS NO NECESSITY FOR MY HAVING ANY PROFESSION
AT ALL, AS I MIGHT BE AS DASHING AND EXPENSIVE WITHOUT
A RED COAT ON MY BACK AS WITH ONE, IDLENESS WAS PRONOUNCED
ON THE WHOLE TO BE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS AND HONOURABLE,
AND A YOUNG MAN OF EIGHTEEN IS NOT IN GENERAL SO EARNESTLY
BENT ON BEING BUSY AS TO RESIST THE SOLICITATIONS OF HIS
FRIENDS TO DO NOTHING.  I WAS THEREFORE ENTERED AT OXFORD
AND HAVE BEEN PROPERLY IDLE EVER SINCE."

"THE CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH, I SUPPOSE, WILL BE,"
SAID MRS. DASHWOOD, "SINCE LEISURE HAS NOT PROMOTED
YOUR OWN HAPPINESS, THAT YOUR SONS WILL BE BROUGHT UP
TO AS MANY PURSUITS, EMPLOYMENTS, PROFESSIONS, AND TRADES
AS COLUMELLA'S."

"THEY WILL BE BROUGHT UP," SAID HE, IN A SERIOUS ACCENT,
"TO BE AS UNLIKE MYSELF AS IS POSSIBLE.  IN FEELING,
IN ACTION, IN CONDITION, IN EVERY THING."

"COME, COME; THIS IS ALL AN EFFUSION OF IMMEDIATE
WANT OF SPIRITS, EDWARD.  YOU ARE IN A MELANCHOLY HUMOUR,
AND FANCY THAT ANY ONE UNLIKE YOURSELF MUST BE HAPPY.
BUT REMEMBER THAT THE PAIN OF PARTING FROM FRIENDS
WILL BE FELT BY EVERY BODY AT TIMES, WHATEVER BE THEIR
EDUCATION OR STATE.  KNOW YOUR OWN HAPPINESS.  YOU WANT
NOTHING BUT PATIENCE--OR GIVE IT A MORE FASCINATING NAME,
CALL IT HOPE.  YOUR MOTHER WILL SECURE TO YOU, IN TIME,
THAT INDEPENDENCE YOU ARE SO ANXIOUS FOR; IT IS HER DUTY,
AND IT WILL, IT MUST ERE LONG BECOME HER HAPPINESS TO
PREVENT YOUR WHOLE YOUTH FROM BEING WASTED IN DISCONTENT.
HOW MUCH MAY NOT A FEW MONTHS DO?"

"I THINK," REPLIED EDWARD, "THAT I MAY DEFY MANY
MONTHS TO PRODUCE ANY GOOD TO ME."

THIS DESPONDING TURN OF MIND, THOUGH IT COULD NOT
BE COMMUNICATED TO MRS. DASHWOOD, GAVE ADDITIONAL PAIN
TO THEM ALL IN THE PARTING, WHICH SHORTLY TOOK PLACE,
AND LEFT AN UNCOMFORTABLE IMPRESSION ON ELINOR'S
FEELINGS ESPECIALLY, WHICH REQUIRED SOME TROUBLE AND TIME
TO SUBDUE.  BUT AS IT WAS HER DETERMINATION TO SUBDUE IT,
AND TO PREVENT HERSELF FROM APPEARING TO SUFFER MORE THAN
WHAT ALL HER FAMILY SUFFERED ON HIS GOING AWAY, SHE DID
NOT ADOPT THE METHOD SO JUDICIOUSLY EMPLOYED BY MARIANNE,
ON A SIMILAR OCCASION, TO AUGMENT AND FIX HER SORROW,
BY SEEKING SILENCE, SOLITUDE AND IDLENESS.  THEIR MEANS
WERE AS DIFFERENT AS THEIR OBJECTS, AND EQUALLY SUITED
TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF EACH.

ELINOR SAT DOWN TO HER DRAWING-TABLE AS SOON AS HE
WAS OUT OF THE HOUSE, BUSILY EMPLOYED HERSELF THE WHOLE DAY,
NEITHER SOUGHT NOR AVOIDED THE MENTION OF HIS NAME,
APPEARED TO INTEREST HERSELF ALMOST AS MUCH AS EVER IN THE
GENERAL CONCERNS OF THE FAMILY, AND IF, BY THIS CONDUCT,
SHE DID NOT LESSEN HER OWN GRIEF, IT WAS AT LEAST PREVENTED
FROM UNNECESSARY INCREASE, AND HER MOTHER AND SISTERS
WERE SPARED MUCH SOLICITUDE ON HER ACCOUNT.

SUCH BEHAVIOUR AS THIS, SO EXACTLY THE REVERSE
OF HER OWN, APPEARED NO MORE MERITORIOUS TO MARIANNE,
THAN HER OWN HAD SEEMED FAULTY TO HER.  THE BUSINESS
OF SELF-COMMAND SHE SETTLED VERY EASILY;--WITH STRONG
AFFECTIONS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, WITH CALM ONES IT COULD
HAVE NO MERIT.  THAT HER SISTER'S AFFECTIONS WERE CALM,
SHE DARED NOT DENY, THOUGH SHE BLUSHED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT;
AND OF THE STRENGTH OF HER OWN, SHE GAVE A VERY STRIKING PROOF,
BY STILL LOVING AND RESPECTING THAT SISTER, IN SPITE
OF THIS MORTIFYING CONVICTION.

WITHOUT SHUTTING HERSELF UP FROM HER FAMILY,
OR LEAVING THE HOUSE IN DETERMINED SOLITUDE TO AVOID THEM,
OR LYING AWAKE THE WHOLE NIGHT TO INDULGE MEDITATION,
ELINOR FOUND EVERY DAY AFFORDED HER LEISURE ENOUGH
TO THINK OF EDWARD, AND OF EDWARD'S BEHAVIOUR, IN EVERY
POSSIBLE VARIETY WHICH THE DIFFERENT STATE OF HER SPIRITS
AT DIFFERENT TIMES COULD PRODUCE,--WITH TENDERNESS,
PITY, APPROBATION, CENSURE, AND DOUBT.  THERE WERE MOMENTS
IN ABUNDANCE, WHEN, IF NOT BY THE ABSENCE OF HER MOTHER
AND SISTERS, AT LEAST BY THE NATURE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENTS,
CONVERSATION WAS FORBIDDEN AMONG THEM, AND EVERY EFFECT
OF SOLITUDE WAS PRODUCED.  HER MIND WAS INEVITABLY
AT LIBERTY; HER THOUGHTS COULD NOT BE CHAINED ELSEWHERE;
AND THE PAST AND THE FUTURE, ON A SUBJECT SO INTERESTING,
MUST BE BEFORE HER, MUST FORCE HER ATTENTION, AND ENGROSS
HER MEMORY, HER REFLECTION, AND HER FANCY.

FROM A REVERIE OF THIS KIND, AS SHE SAT AT HER
DRAWING-TABLE, SHE WAS ROUSED ONE MORNING, SOON AFTER
EDWARD'S LEAVING THEM, BY THE ARRIVAL OF COMPANY.
SHE HAPPENED TO BE QUITE ALONE.  THE CLOSING OF THE
LITTLE GATE, AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GREEN COURT IN FRONT
OF THE HOUSE, DREW HER EYES TO THE WINDOW, AND SHE SAW
A LARGE PARTY WALKING UP TO THE DOOR.  AMONGST THEM
WERE SIR JOHN AND LADY MIDDLETON AND MRS. JENNINGS,
BUT THERE WERE TWO OTHERS, A GENTLEMAN AND LADY, WHO WERE
QUITE UNKNOWN TO HER.  SHE WAS SITTING NEAR THE WINDOW,
AND AS SOON AS SIR JOHN PERCEIVED HER, HE LEFT THE REST
OF THE PARTY TO THE CEREMONY OF KNOCKING AT THE DOOR,
AND STEPPING ACROSS THE TURF, OBLIGED HER TO OPEN THE
CASEMENT TO SPEAK TO HIM, THOUGH THE SPACE WAS SO SHORT
BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE WINDOW, AS TO MAKE IT HARDLY
POSSIBLE TO SPEAK AT ONE WITHOUT BEING HEARD AT THE OTHER.

"WELL," SAID HE, "WE HAVE BROUGHT YOU SOME STRANGERS.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM?"

"HUSH! THEY WILL HEAR YOU."

"NEVER MIND IF THEY DO.  IT IS ONLY THE PALMERS.
CHARLOTTE IS VERY PRETTY, I CAN TELL YOU.  YOU MAY SEE HER
IF YOU LOOK THIS WAY."

AS ELINOR WAS CERTAIN OF SEEING HER IN A COUPLE
OF MINUTES, WITHOUT TAKING THAT LIBERTY, SHE BEGGED
TO BE EXCUSED.

"WHERE IS MARIANNE? HAS SHE RUN AWAY BECAUSE WE
ARE COME? I SEE HER INSTRUMENT IS OPEN."

"SHE IS WALKING, I BELIEVE."

THEY WERE NOW JOINED BY MRS. JENNINGS, WHO HAD NOT
PATIENCE ENOUGH TO WAIT TILL THE DOOR WAS OPENED BEFORE
SHE TOLD HER STORY.  SHE CAME HALLOOING TO THE WINDOW,
"HOW DO YOU DO, MY DEAR?  HOW DOES MRS. DASHWOOD DO?
AND WHERE ARE YOUR SISTERS?  WHAT! ALL ALONE! YOU
WILL BE GLAD OF A LITTLE COMPANY TO SIT WITH YOU.
I HAVE BROUGHT MY OTHER SON AND DAUGHTER TO SEE YOU.
ONLY THINK OF THEIR COMING SO SUDDENLY!  I THOUGHT I HEARD
A CARRIAGE LAST NIGHT, WHILE WE WERE DRINKING OUR TEA,
BUT IT NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD THAT IT COULD BE THEM.
I THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT BE COLONEL
BRANDON COME BACK AGAIN; SO I SAID TO SIR JOHN, I DO THINK
I HEAR A CARRIAGE; PERHAPS IT IS COLONEL BRANDON COME
BACK AGAIN"--

ELINOR WAS OBLIGED TO TURN FROM HER, IN THE MIDDLE
OF HER STORY, TO RECEIVE THE REST OF THE PARTY; LADY
MIDDLETON INTRODUCED THE TWO STRANGERS; MRS. DASHWOOD
AND MARGARET CAME DOWN STAIRS AT THE SAME TIME, AND THEY
ALL SAT DOWN TO LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER, WHILE MRS. JENNINGS
CONTINUED HER STORY AS SHE WALKED THROUGH THE PASSAGE
INTO THE PARLOUR, ATTENDED BY SIR JOHN.

MRS. PALMER WAS SEVERAL YEARS YOUNGER THAN LADY
MIDDLETON, AND TOTALLY UNLIKE HER IN EVERY RESPECT.
SHE WAS SHORT AND PLUMP, HAD A VERY PRETTY FACE,
AND THE FINEST EXPRESSION OF GOOD HUMOUR IN IT THAT COULD
POSSIBLY BE.  HER MANNERS WERE BY NO MEANS SO ELEGANT
AS HER SISTER'S, BUT THEY WERE MUCH MORE PREPOSSESSING.
SHE CAME IN WITH A SMILE, SMILED ALL THE TIME OF HER VISIT,
EXCEPT WHEN SHE LAUGHED, AND SMILED WHEN SHE WENT AWAY.
HER HUSBAND WAS A GRAVE LOOKING YOUNG MAN OF FIVE OR SIX
AND TWENTY, WITH AN AIR OF MORE FASHION AND SENSE THAN
HIS WIFE, BUT OF LESS WILLINGNESS TO PLEASE OR BE PLEASED.
HE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A LOOK OF SELF-CONSEQUENCE,
SLIGHTLY BOWED TO THE LADIES, WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD,
AND, AFTER BRIEFLY SURVEYING THEM AND THEIR APARTMENTS,
TOOK UP A NEWSPAPER FROM THE TABLE, AND CONTINUED TO READ IT
AS LONG AS HE STAID.

MRS. PALMER, ON THE CONTRARY, WHO WAS STRONGLY ENDOWED
BY NATURE WITH A TURN FOR BEING UNIFORMLY CIVIL AND HAPPY,
WAS HARDLY SEATED BEFORE HER ADMIRATION OF THE PARLOUR
AND EVERY THING IN IT BURST FORTH.

"WELL! WHAT A DELIGHTFUL ROOM THIS IS! I NEVER
SAW ANYTHING SO CHARMING!  ONLY THINK, MAMMA, HOW IT
IS IMPROVED SINCE I WAS HERE LAST! I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT
SUCH A SWEET PLACE, MA'AM! (TURNING TO MRS. DASHWOOD)
BUT YOU HAVE MADE IT SO CHARMING!  ONLY LOOK, SISTER,
HOW DELIGHTFUL EVERY THING IS! HOW I SHOULD LIKE SUCH
A HOUSE FOR MYSELF!  SHOULD NOT YOU, MR. PALMER?"

MR. PALMER MADE HER NO ANSWER, AND DID NOT EVEN RAISE
HIS EYES FROM THE NEWSPAPER.

"MR. PALMER DOES NOT HEAR ME," SAID SHE, LAUGHING;
"HE NEVER DOES SOMETIMES.  IT IS SO RIDICULOUS!"

THIS WAS QUITE A NEW IDEA TO MRS. DASHWOOD; SHE HAD
NEVER BEEN USED TO FIND WIT IN THE INATTENTION OF ANY ONE,
AND COULD NOT HELP LOOKING WITH SURPRISE AT THEM BOTH.

MRS. JENNINGS, IN THE MEANTIME, TALKED ON AS LOUD
AS SHE COULD, AND CONTINUED HER ACCOUNT OF THEIR SURPRISE,
THE EVENING BEFORE, ON SEEING THEIR FRIENDS, WITHOUT
CEASING TILL EVERY THING WAS TOLD.  MRS. PALMER LAUGHED
HEARTILY AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR ASTONISHMENT,
AND EVERY BODY AGREED, TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER, THAT IT
HAD BEEN QUITE AN AGREEABLE SURPRISE.

"YOU MAY BELIEVE HOW GLAD WE ALL WERE TO SEE THEM,"
ADDED MRS. JENNINGS, LEANING FORWARD TOWARDS ELINOR,
AND SPEAKING IN A LOW VOICE AS IF SHE MEANT TO BE HEARD
BY NO ONE ELSE, THOUGH THEY WERE SEATED ON DIFFERENT SIDES
OF THE ROOM; "BUT, HOWEVER, I CAN'T HELP WISHING THEY HAD
NOT TRAVELLED QUITE SO FAST, NOR MADE SUCH A LONG JOURNEY
OF IT, FOR THEY CAME ALL ROUND BY LONDON UPON ACCOUNT
OF SOME BUSINESS, FOR YOU KNOW (NODDING SIGNIFICANTLY AND
POINTING TO HER DAUGHTER) IT WAS WRONG IN HER SITUATION.
I WANTED HER TO STAY AT HOME AND REST THIS MORNING,
BUT SHE WOULD COME WITH US; SHE LONGED SO MUCH TO SEE
YOU ALL!"

MRS. PALMER LAUGHED, AND SAID IT WOULD NOT DO HER
ANY HARM.

"SHE EXPECTS TO BE CONFINED IN FEBRUARY,"
CONTINUED MRS. JENNINGS.

LADY MIDDLETON COULD NO LONGER ENDURE SUCH A CONVERSATION,
AND THEREFORE EXERTED HERSELF TO ASK MR. PALMER IF THERE
WAS ANY NEWS IN THE PAPER.

"NO, NONE AT ALL," HE REPLIED, AND READ ON.

"HERE COMES MARIANNE," CRIED SIR JOHN.  "NOW, PALMER,
YOU SHALL SEE A MONSTROUS PRETTY GIRL."

HE IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO THE PASSAGE, OPENED THE FRONT DOOR,
AND USHERED HER IN HIMSELF.  MRS. JENNINGS ASKED HER,
AS SOON AS SHE APPEARED, IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN TO ALLENHAM;
AND MRS. PALMER LAUGHED SO HEARTILY AT THE QUESTION,
AS TO SHOW SHE UNDERSTOOD IT.  MR. PALMER LOOKED UP
ON HER ENTERING THE ROOM, STARED AT HER SOME MINUTES,
AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS NEWSPAPER.  MRS. PALMER'S EYE
WAS NOW CAUGHT BY THE DRAWINGS WHICH HUNG ROUND THE ROOM.
SHE GOT UP TO EXAMINE THEM.

"OH! DEAR, HOW BEAUTIFUL THESE ARE!  WELL! HOW DELIGHTFUL!
DO BUT LOOK, MAMA, HOW SWEET! I DECLARE THEY ARE QUITE CHARMING;
I COULD LOOK AT THEM FOR EVER." AND THEN SITTING DOWN AGAIN,
SHE VERY SOON FORGOT THAT THERE WERE ANY SUCH THINGS IN THE ROOM.

WHEN LADY MIDDLETON ROSE TO GO AWAY, MR. PALMER
ROSE ALSO, LAID DOWN THE NEWSPAPER, STRETCHED HIMSELF
AND LOOKED AT THEM ALL AROUND.

"MY LOVE, HAVE YOU BEEN ASLEEP?" SAID HIS WIFE, LAUGHING.

HE MADE HER NO ANSWER; AND ONLY OBSERVED, AFTER AGAIN
EXAMINING THE ROOM, THAT IT WAS VERY LOW PITCHED,
AND THAT THE CEILING WAS CROOKED.  HE THEN MADE HIS BOW,
AND DEPARTED WITH THE REST.

SIR JOHN HAD BEEN VERY URGENT WITH THEM ALL TO
SPEND THE NEXT DAY AT THE PARK.  MRS. DASHWOOD, WHO DID
NOT CHUSE TO DINE WITH THEM OFTENER THAN THEY DINED
AT THE COTTAGE, ABSOLUTELY REFUSED ON HER OWN ACCOUNT;
HER DAUGHTERS MIGHT DO AS THEY PLEASED.  BUT THEY HAD NO
CURIOSITY TO SEE HOW MR. AND MRS. PALMER ATE THEIR DINNER,
AND NO EXPECTATION OF PLEASURE FROM THEM IN ANY OTHER WAY.
THEY ATTEMPTED, THEREFORE, LIKEWISE, TO EXCUSE THEMSELVES;
THE WEATHER WAS UNCERTAIN, AND NOT LIKELY TO BE GOOD.
BUT SIR JOHN WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED--THE CARRIAGE SHOULD
BE SENT FOR THEM AND THEY MUST COME.  LADY MIDDLETON TOO,
THOUGH SHE DID NOT PRESS THEIR MOTHER, PRESSED THEM.
MRS. JENNINGS AND MRS. PALMER JOINED THEIR ENTREATIES, ALL
SEEMED EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID A FAMILY PARTY; AND THE YOUNG
LADIES WERE OBLIGED TO YIELD.

"WHY SHOULD THEY ASK US?" SAID MARIANNE, AS SOON AS THEY
WERE GONE.  "THE RENT OF THIS COTTAGE IS SAID TO BE LOW;
BUT WE HAVE IT ON VERY HARD TERMS, IF WE ARE TO DINE
AT THE PARK WHENEVER ANY ONE IS STAYING EITHER WITH THEM,
OR WITH US."

"THEY MEAN NO LESS TO BE CIVIL AND KIND TO US NOW,"
SAID ELINOR, "BY THESE FREQUENT INVITATIONS, THAN BY
THOSE WHICH WE RECEIVED FROM THEM A FEW WEEKS AGO.
THE ALTERATION IS NOT IN THEM, IF THEIR PARTIES ARE GROWN
TEDIOUS AND DULL.  WE MUST LOOK FOR THE CHANGE ELSEWHERE."



CHAPTER 20


AS THE MISS DASHWOODS ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM OF THE PARK
THE NEXT DAY, AT ONE DOOR, MRS. PALMER CAME RUNNING IN AT
THE OTHER, LOOKING AS GOOD HUMOURED AND MERRY AS BEFORE.
SHE TOOK THEM ALL MOST AFFECTIONATELY BY THE HAND,
AND EXPRESSED GREAT DELIGHT IN SEEING THEM AGAIN.

"I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU!" SAID SHE, SEATING HERSELF
BETWEEN ELINOR AND MARIANNE, "FOR IT IS SO BAD A DAY I WAS
AFRAID YOU MIGHT NOT COME, WHICH WOULD BE A SHOCKING THING,
AS WE GO AWAY AGAIN TOMORROW. WE MUST GO, FOR THE WESTONS
COME TO US NEXT WEEK YOU KNOW.  IT WAS QUITE A SUDDEN THING
OUR COMING AT ALL, AND I KNEW NOTHING OF IT TILL THE CARRIAGE
WAS COMING TO THE DOOR, AND THEN MR. PALMER ASKED ME IF I
WOULD GO WITH HIM TO BARTON.  HE IS SO DROLL! HE NEVER
TELLS ME ANY THING! I AM SO SORRY WE CANNOT STAY LONGER;
HOWEVER WE SHALL MEET AGAIN IN TOWN VERY SOON, I HOPE."

THEY WERE OBLIGED TO PUT AN END TO SUCH AN EXPECTATION.

"NOT GO TO TOWN!" CRIED MRS. PALMER, WITH A LAUGH,
"I SHALL BE QUITE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DO NOT.  I COULD
GET THE NICEST HOUSE IN WORLD FOR YOU, NEXT DOOR TO OURS,
IN HANOVER-SQUARE.  YOU MUST COME, INDEED.  I AM SURE
I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO CHAPERON YOU AT ANY TIME TILL
I AM CONFINED, IF MRS. DASHWOOD SHOULD NOT LIKE TO GO
INTO PUBLIC."

THEY THANKED HER; BUT WERE OBLIGED TO RESIST ALL
HER ENTREATIES.

"OH, MY LOVE," CRIED MRS. PALMER TO HER HUSBAND,
WHO JUST THEN ENTERED THE ROOM--"YOU MUST HELP ME TO
PERSUADE THE MISS DASHWOODS TO GO TO TOWN THIS WINTER."

HER LOVE MADE NO ANSWER; AND AFTER SLIGHTLY BOWING
TO THE LADIES, BEGAN COMPLAINING OF THE WEATHER.

"HOW HORRID ALL THIS IS!" SAID HE.  "SUCH WEATHER
MAKES EVERY THING AND EVERY BODY DISGUSTING.  DULLNESS
IS AS MUCH PRODUCED WITHIN DOORS AS WITHOUT, BY RAIN.
IT MAKES ONE DETEST ALL ONE'S ACQUAINTANCE.  WHAT THE
DEVIL DOES SIR JOHN MEAN BY NOT HAVING A BILLIARD ROOM
IN HIS HOUSE?  HOW FEW PEOPLE KNOW WHAT COMFORT IS!  SIR
JOHN IS AS STUPID AS THE WEATHER."

THE REST OF THE COMPANY SOON DROPT IN.

"I AM AFRAID, MISS MARIANNE," SAID SIR JOHN, "YOU HAVE
NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE YOUR USUAL WALK TO ALLENHAM TODAY."

MARIANNE LOOKED VERY GRAVE AND SAID NOTHING.

"OH, DON'T BE SO SLY BEFORE US," SAID MRS. PALMER;
"FOR WE KNOW ALL ABOUT IT, I ASSURE YOU; AND I ADMIRE YOUR
TASTE VERY MUCH, FOR I THINK HE IS EXTREMELY HANDSOME.
WE DO NOT LIVE A GREAT WAY FROM HIM IN THE COUNTRY, YOU KNOW.
NOT ABOVE TEN MILES, I DARE SAY."

"MUCH NEARER THIRTY," SAID HER HUSBAND.

"AH, WELL! THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE.
I NEVER WAS AT HIS HOUSE; BUT THEY SAY IT IS A SWEET
PRETTY PLACE."

"AS VILE A SPOT AS I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE,"
SAID MR. PALMER.

MARIANNE REMAINED PERFECTLY SILENT, THOUGH HER
COUNTENANCE BETRAYED HER INTEREST IN WHAT WAS SAID.

"IS IT VERY UGLY?" CONTINUED MRS. PALMER--"THEN IT
MUST BE SOME OTHER PLACE THAT IS SO PRETTY I SUPPOSE."

WHEN THEY WERE SEATED IN THE DINING ROOM, SIR JOHN
OBSERVED WITH REGRET THAT THEY WERE ONLY EIGHT ALL TOGETHER.

"MY DEAR," SAID HE TO HIS LADY, "IT IS VERY PROVOKING
THAT WE SHOULD BE SO FEW.  WHY DID NOT YOU ASK THE GILBERTS
TO COME TO US TODAY?"

"DID NOT I TELL YOU, SIR JOHN, WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME
ABOUT IT BEFORE, THAT IT COULD NOT BE DONE?  THEY DINED
WITH US LAST."

"YOU AND I, SIR JOHN," SAID MRS. JENNINGS,
"SHOULD NOT STAND UPON SUCH CEREMONY."

"THEN YOU WOULD BE VERY ILL-BRED," CRIED MR. PALMER.

"MY LOVE YOU CONTRADICT EVERY BODY," SAID HIS WIFE
WITH HER USUAL LAUGH.  "DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE QUITE RUDE?"

"I DID NOT KNOW I CONTRADICTED ANY BODY IN CALLING
YOUR MOTHER ILL-BRED."

"AY, YOU MAY ABUSE ME AS YOU PLEASE," SAID THE GOOD-NATURED
OLD LADY, "YOU HAVE TAKEN CHARLOTTE OFF MY HANDS, AND CANNOT
GIVE HER BACK AGAIN.  SO THERE I HAVE THE WHIP HAND OF YOU."

CHARLOTTE LAUGHED HEARTILY TO THINK THAT HER
HUSBAND COULD NOT GET RID OF HER; AND EXULTINGLY SAID,
SHE DID NOT CARE HOW CROSS HE WAS TO HER, AS THEY MUST
LIVE TOGETHER.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO BE MORE
THOROUGHLY GOOD-NATURED, OR MORE DETERMINED TO BE HAPPY
THAN MRS. PALMER.  THE STUDIED INDIFFERENCE, INSOLENCE,
AND DISCONTENT OF HER HUSBAND GAVE HER NO PAIN;
AND WHEN HE SCOLDED OR ABUSED HER, SHE WAS HIGHLY DIVERTED.

"MR. PALMER IS SO DROLL!" SAID SHE, IN A WHISPER,
TO ELINOR.  "HE IS ALWAYS OUT OF HUMOUR."

ELINOR WAS NOT INCLINED, AFTER A LITTLE OBSERVATION,
TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR BEING SO GENUINELY AND UNAFFECTEDLY
ILL-NATURED OR ILL-BRED AS HE WISHED TO APPEAR.
HIS TEMPER MIGHT PERHAPS BE A LITTLE SOURED BY FINDING,
LIKE MANY OTHERS OF HIS SEX, THAT THROUGH SOME UNACCOUNTABLE
BIAS IN FAVOUR OF BEAUTY, HE WAS THE HUSBAND OF A VERY SILLY
WOMAN,--BUT SHE KNEW THAT THIS KIND OF BLUNDER WAS TOO
COMMON FOR ANY SENSIBLE MAN TO BE LASTINGLY HURT BY IT.--
IT WAS RATHER A WISH OF DISTINCTION, SHE BELIEVED,
WHICH PRODUCED HIS CONTEMPTUOUS TREATMENT OF EVERY BODY,
AND HIS GENERAL ABUSE OF EVERY THING BEFORE HIM.
IT WAS THE DESIRE OF APPEARING SUPERIOR TO OTHER PEOPLE.
THE MOTIVE WAS TOO COMMON TO BE WONDERED AT; BUT THE MEANS,
HOWEVER THEY MIGHT SUCCEED BY ESTABLISHING HIS SUPERIORITY
IN ILL-BREEDING, WERE NOT LIKELY TO ATTACH ANY ONE TO HIM
EXCEPT HIS WIFE.

"OH, MY DEAR MISS DASHWOOD," SAID MRS. PALMER SOON AFTERWARDS,
"I HAVE GOT SUCH A FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU AND YOUR SISTER.
WILL YOU COME AND SPEND SOME TIME AT CLEVELAND THIS
CHRISTMAS?  NOW, PRAY DO,--AND COME WHILE THE WESTONS ARE
WITH US.  YOU CANNOT THINK HOW HAPPY I SHALL BE!  IT WILL
BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL!--MY LOVE," APPLYING TO HER HUSBAND,
"DON'T YOU LONG TO HAVE THE MISS DASHWOODS COME TO CLEVELAND?"

"CERTAINLY," HE REPLIED, WITH A SNEER--"I CAME
INTO DEVONSHIRE WITH NO OTHER VIEW."

"THERE NOW,"--SAID HIS LADY, "YOU SEE MR. PALMER
EXPECTS YOU; SO YOU CANNOT REFUSE TO COME."

THEY BOTH EAGERLY AND RESOLUTELY DECLINED HER INVITATION.

"BUT INDEED YOU MUST AND SHALL COME.  I AM SURE YOU
WILL LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS.  THE WESTONS WILL BE WITH US,
AND IT WILL BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL.  YOU CANNOT THINK
WHAT A SWEET PLACE CLEVELAND IS; AND WE ARE SO GAY NOW,
FOR MR. PALMER IS ALWAYS GOING ABOUT THE COUNTRY CANVASSING
AGAINST THE ELECTION; AND SO MANY PEOPLE CAME TO DINE
WITH US THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE, IT IS QUITE CHARMING!  BUT,
POOR FELLOW! IT IS VERY FATIGUING TO HIM! FOR HE IS FORCED
TO MAKE EVERY BODY LIKE HIM."

ELINOR COULD HARDLY KEEP HER COUNTENANCE AS SHE
ASSENTED TO THE HARDSHIP OF SUCH AN OBLIGATION.

"HOW CHARMING IT WILL BE," SAID CHARLOTTE, "WHEN HE
IS IN PARLIAMENT!--WON'T IT? HOW I SHALL LAUGH!  IT WILL
BE SO RIDICULOUS TO SEE ALL HIS LETTERS DIRECTED TO HIM
WITH AN M.P.--BUT DO YOU KNOW, HE SAYS, HE WILL NEVER FRANK
FOR ME?  HE DECLARES HE WON'T.  DON'T YOU, MR. PALMER?"

MR. PALMER TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER.

"HE CANNOT BEAR WRITING, YOU KNOW," SHE CONTINUED--
"HE SAYS IT IS QUITE SHOCKING."

"NO," SAID HE, "I NEVER SAID ANY THING SO IRRATIONAL.
DON'T PALM ALL YOUR ABUSES OF LANGUAGES UPON ME."

"THERE NOW; YOU SEE HOW DROLL HE IS.  THIS IS ALWAYS
THE WAY WITH HIM!  SOMETIMES HE WON'T SPEAK TO ME FOR HALF
A DAY TOGETHER, AND THEN HE COMES OUT WITH SOMETHING
SO DROLL--ALL ABOUT ANY THING IN THE WORLD."

SHE SURPRISED ELINOR VERY MUCH AS THEY RETURNED
INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM, BY ASKING HER WHETHER SHE DID
NOT LIKE MR. PALMER EXCESSIVELY.

"CERTAINLY," SAID ELINOR; "HE SEEMS VERY AGREEABLE."

"WELL--I AM SO GLAD YOU DO.  I THOUGHT YOU WOULD,
HE IS SO PLEASANT; AND MR. PALMER IS EXCESSIVELY PLEASED
WITH YOU AND YOUR SISTERS I CAN TELL YOU, AND YOU CAN'T
THINK HOW DISAPPOINTED HE WILL BE IF YOU DON'T COME
TO CLEVELAND.--I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY YOU SHOULD OBJECT
TO IT."

ELINOR WAS AGAIN OBLIGED TO DECLINE HER INVITATION;
AND BY CHANGING THE SUBJECT, PUT A STOP TO HER ENTREATIES.
SHE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT AS THEY LIVED IN THE
SAME COUNTY, MRS. PALMER MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME
MORE PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF WILLOUGHBY'S GENERAL
CHARACTER, THAN COULD BE GATHERED FROM THE MIDDLETONS'
PARTIAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM; AND SHE WAS EAGER TO GAIN
FROM ANY ONE, SUCH A CONFIRMATION OF HIS MERITS AS MIGHT
REMOVE THE POSSIBILITY OF FEAR FROM MARIANNE.  SHE BEGAN
BY INQUIRING IF THEY SAW MUCH OF MR. WILLOUGHBY AT CLEVELAND,
AND WHETHER THEY WERE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM.

"OH DEAR, YES; I KNOW HIM EXTREMELY WELL,"
REPLIED MRS. PALMER;--"NOT THAT I EVER SPOKE
TO HIM, INDEED; BUT I HAVE SEEN HIM FOR EVER IN TOWN.
SOMEHOW OR OTHER I NEVER HAPPENED TO BE STAYING AT BARTON
WHILE HE WAS AT ALLENHAM.  MAMA SAW HIM HERE ONCE BEFORE;--
BUT I WAS WITH MY UNCLE AT WEYMOUTH.  HOWEVER, I DARE SAY
WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF HIM IN SOMERSETSHIRE,
IF IT HAD NOT HAPPENED VERY UNLUCKILY THAT WE SHOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY TOGETHER.  HE IS VERY LITTLE
AT COMBE, I BELIEVE; BUT IF HE WERE EVER SO MUCH THERE,
I DO NOT THINK MR. PALMER WOULD VISIT HIM, FOR HE IS
IN THE OPPOSITION, YOU KNOW, AND BESIDES IT IS SUCH A
WAY OFF.  I KNOW WHY YOU INQUIRE ABOUT HIM, VERY WELL;
YOUR SISTER IS TO MARRY HIM.  I AM MONSTROUS GLAD OF IT,
FOR THEN I SHALL HAVE HER FOR A NEIGHBOUR YOU KNOW."

"UPON MY WORD," REPLIED ELINOR, "YOU KNOW MUCH
MORE OF THE MATTER THAN I DO, IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON
TO EXPECT SUCH A MATCH."

"DON'T PRETEND TO DENY IT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT IS
WHAT EVERY BODY TALKS OF.  I ASSURE YOU I HEARD OF IT
IN MY WAY THROUGH TOWN."

"MY DEAR MRS. PALMER!"

"UPON MY HONOUR I DID.--I MET COLONEL BRANDON
MONDAY MORNING IN BOND-STREET, JUST BEFORE WE LEFT TOWN,
AND HE TOLD ME OF IT DIRECTLY."

"YOU SURPRISE ME VERY MUCH.  COLONEL BRANDON TELL
YOU OF IT!  SURELY YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.  TO GIVE SUCH
INTELLIGENCE TO A PERSON WHO COULD NOT BE INTERESTED IN IT,
EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE, IS NOT WHAT I SHOULD EXPECT COLONEL
BRANDON TO DO."

"BUT I DO ASSURE YOU IT WAS SO, FOR ALL THAT,
AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT HAPPENED.  WHEN WE MET HIM,
HE TURNED BACK AND WALKED WITH US; AND SO WE BEGAN TALKING
OF MY BROTHER AND SISTER, AND ONE THING AND ANOTHER,
AND I SAID TO HIM, 'SO, COLONEL, THERE IS A NEW FAMILY
COME TO BARTON COTTAGE, I HEAR, AND MAMA SENDS ME WORD
THEY ARE VERY PRETTY, AND THAT ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO BE
MARRIED TO MR. WILLOUGHBY OF COMBE MAGNA.  IS IT TRUE,
PRAY? FOR OF COURSE YOU MUST KNOW, AS YOU HAVE BEEN IN
DEVONSHIRE SO LATELY.'"

"AND WHAT DID THE COLONEL SAY?"

"OH--HE DID NOT SAY MUCH; BUT HE LOOKED AS IF HE
KNEW IT TO BE TRUE, SO FROM THAT MOMENT I SET IT DOWN
AS CERTAIN.  IT WILL BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL, I DECLARE!
WHEN IS IT TO TAKE PLACE?"

"MR. BRANDON WAS VERY WELL I HOPE?"

"OH! YES, QUITE WELL; AND SO FULL OF YOUR PRAISES,
HE DID NOTHING BUT SAY FINE THINGS OF YOU."

"I AM FLATTERED BY HIS COMMENDATION.  HE SEEMS
AN EXCELLENT MAN; AND I THINK HIM UNCOMMONLY PLEASING."

"SO DO I.--HE IS SUCH A CHARMING MAN, THAT IT
IS QUITE A PITY HE SHOULD BE SO GRAVE AND SO DULL.
MAMMA SAYS HE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOUR SISTER TOO.--
I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A GREAT COMPLIMENT IF HE WAS, FOR HE
HARDLY EVER FALLS IN LOVE WITH ANY BODY."

"IS MR. WILLOUGHBY MUCH KNOWN IN YOUR PART
OF SOMERSETSHIRE?" SAID ELINOR.

"OH! YES, EXTREMELY WELL; THAT IS, I DO NOT BELIEVE
MANY PEOPLE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM, BECAUSE COMBE MAGNA
IS SO FAR OFF; BUT THEY ALL THINK HIM EXTREMELY AGREEABLE
I ASSURE YOU.  NOBODY IS MORE LIKED THAN MR. WILLOUGHBY
WHEREVER HE GOES, AND SO YOU MAY TELL YOUR SISTER.
SHE IS A MONSTROUS LUCKY GIRL TO GET HIM, UPON MY HONOUR;
NOT BUT THAT HE IS MUCH MORE LUCKY IN GETTING HER,
BECAUSE SHE IS SO VERY HANDSOME AND AGREEABLE, THAT NOTHING
CAN BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.  HOWEVER, I DON'T THINK
HER HARDLY AT ALL HANDSOMER THAN YOU, I ASSURE YOU;
FOR I THINK YOU BOTH EXCESSIVELY PRETTY, AND SO DOES
MR. PALMER TOO I AM SURE, THOUGH WE COULD NOT GET HIM
TO OWN IT LAST NIGHT."

MRS. PALMER'S INFORMATION RESPECTING WILLOUGHBY
WAS NOT VERY MATERIAL; BUT ANY TESTIMONY IN HIS FAVOUR,
HOWEVER SMALL, WAS PLEASING TO HER.

"I AM SO GLAD WE ARE GOT ACQUAINTED AT LAST,"
CONTINUED CHARLOTTE.--"AND NOW I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS BE
GREAT FRIENDS.  YOU CAN'T THINK HOW MUCH I LONGED TO SEE YOU!
IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT YOU SHOULD LIVE AT THE COTTAGE!
NOTHING CAN BE LIKE IT, TO BE SURE!  AND I AM SO GLAD
YOUR SISTER IS GOING TO BE WELL MARRIED!  I HOPE YOU WILL
BE A GREAT DEAL AT COMBE MAGNA.  IT IS A SWEET PLACE,
BY ALL ACCOUNTS."

"YOU HAVE BEEN LONG ACQUAINTED WITH COLONEL BRANDON,
HAVE NOT YOU?"

"YES, A GREAT WHILE; EVER SINCE MY SISTER MARRIED.--
HE WAS A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF SIR JOHN'S. I BELIEVE,"
SHE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE, "HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY
GLAD TO HAVE HAD ME, IF HE COULD.  SIR JOHN AND LADY
MIDDLETON WISHED IT VERY MUCH.  BUT MAMA DID NOT THINK
THE MATCH GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME, OTHERWISE SIR JOHN WOULD
HAVE MENTIONED IT TO THE COLONEL, AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MARRIED IMMEDIATELY."

"DID NOT COLONEL BRANDON KNOW OF SIR JOHN'S PROPOSAL
TO YOUR MOTHER BEFORE IT WAS MADE?  HAD HE NEVER OWNED
HIS AFFECTION TO YOURSELF?"

"OH, NO; BUT IF MAMA HAD NOT OBJECTED TO IT,
I DARE SAY HE WOULD HAVE LIKED IT OF ALL THINGS.
HE HAD NOT SEEN ME THEN ABOVE TWICE, FOR IT WAS BEFORE
I LEFT SCHOOL.  HOWEVER, I AM MUCH HAPPIER AS I AM.
MR. PALMER IS THE KIND OF MAN I LIKE."



CHAPTER 21


THE PALMERS RETURNED TO CLEVELAND THE NEXT DAY,
AND THE TWO FAMILIES AT BARTON WERE AGAIN LEFT TO ENTERTAIN
EACH OTHER.  BUT THIS DID NOT LAST LONG; ELINOR HAD HARDLY
GOT THEIR LAST VISITORS OUT OF HER HEAD, HAD HARDLY DONE
WONDERING AT CHARLOTTE'S BEING SO HAPPY WITHOUT A CAUSE,
AT MR. PALMER'S ACTING SO SIMPLY, WITH GOOD ABILITIES,
AND AT THE STRANGE UNSUITABLENESS WHICH OFTEN EXISTED BETWEEN
HUSBAND AND WIFE, BEFORE SIR JOHN'S AND MRS. JENNINGS'S
ACTIVE ZEAL IN THE CAUSE OF SOCIETY, PROCURED HER SOME
OTHER NEW ACQUAINTANCE TO SEE AND OBSERVE.

IN A MORNING'S EXCURSION TO EXETER, THEY HAD MET WITH
TWO YOUNG LADIES, WHOM MRS. JENNINGS HAD THE SATISFACTION
OF DISCOVERING TO BE HER RELATIONS, AND THIS WAS ENOUGH
FOR SIR JOHN TO INVITE THEM DIRECTLY TO THE PARK,
AS SOON AS THEIR PRESENT ENGAGEMENTS AT EXETER WERE OVER.
THEIR ENGAGEMENTS AT EXETER INSTANTLY GAVE WAY BEFORE
SUCH AN INVITATION, AND LADY MIDDLETON WAS THROWN INTO
NO LITTLE ALARM ON THE RETURN OF SIR JOHN, BY HEARING
THAT SHE WAS VERY SOON TO RECEIVE A VISIT FROM TWO GIRLS
WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN IN HER LIFE, AND OF WHOSE ELEGANCE,--
WHOSE TOLERABLE GENTILITY EVEN, SHE COULD HAVE NO PROOF;
FOR THE ASSURANCES OF HER HUSBAND AND MOTHER ON THAT SUBJECT
WENT FOR NOTHING AT ALL.  THEIR BEING HER RELATIONS TOO
MADE IT SO MUCH THE WORSE; AND MRS. JENNINGS'S ATTEMPTS
AT CONSOLATION WERE THEREFORE UNFORTUNATELY FOUNDED,
WHEN SHE ADVISED HER DAUGHTER NOT TO CARE ABOUT THEIR BEING
SO FASHIONABLE; BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL COUSINS AND MUST PUT
UP WITH ONE ANOTHER.  AS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, HOWEVER, NOW TO
PREVENT THEIR COMING, LADY MIDDLETON RESIGNED HERSELF TO THE
IDEA OF IT, WITH ALL THE PHILOSOPHY OF A WELL-BRED WOMAN,
CONTENTING HERSELF WITH MERELY GIVING HER HUSBAND A GENTLE
REPRIMAND ON THE SUBJECT FIVE OR SIX TIMES EVERY DAY.

THE YOUNG LADIES ARRIVED: THEIR APPEARANCE WAS BY
NO MEANS UNGENTEEL OR UNFASHIONABLE.  THEIR DRESS WAS
VERY SMART, THEIR MANNERS VERY CIVIL, THEY WERE DELIGHTED
WITH THE HOUSE, AND IN RAPTURES WITH THE FURNITURE,
AND THEY HAPPENED TO BE SO DOATINGLY FOND OF CHILDREN
THAT LADY MIDDLETON'S GOOD OPINION WAS ENGAGED IN THEIR
FAVOUR BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN AN HOUR AT THE PARK.
SHE DECLARED THEM TO BE VERY AGREEABLE GIRLS INDEED,
WHICH FOR HER LADYSHIP WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION.
SIR JOHN'S CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN JUDGMENT ROSE WITH THIS
ANIMATED PRAISE, AND HE SET OFF DIRECTLY FOR THE COTTAGE
TO TELL THE MISS DASHWOODS OF THE MISS STEELES' ARRIVAL,
AND TO ASSURE THEM OF THEIR BEING THE SWEETEST GIRLS
IN THE WORLD.  FROM SUCH COMMENDATION AS THIS, HOWEVER,
THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO BE LEARNED; ELINOR WELL KNEW
THAT THE SWEETEST GIRLS IN THE WORLD WERE TO BE MET
WITH IN EVERY PART OF ENGLAND, UNDER EVERY POSSIBLE
VARIATION OF FORM, FACE, TEMPER AND UNDERSTANDING.
SIR JOHN WANTED THE WHOLE FAMILY TO WALK TO THE PARK DIRECTLY
AND LOOK AT HIS GUESTS.  BENEVOLENT, PHILANTHROPIC MAN!  IT
WAS PAINFUL TO HIM EVEN TO KEEP A THIRD COUSIN TO HIMSELF.

"DO COME NOW," SAID HE--"PRAY COME--YOU MUST COME--I
DECLARE YOU SHALL COME--YOU CAN'T THINK HOW YOU WILL
LIKE THEM.  LUCY IS MONSTROUS PRETTY, AND SO GOOD HUMOURED
AND AGREEABLE!  THE CHILDREN ARE ALL HANGING ABOUT HER ALREADY,
AS IF SHE WAS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.  AND THEY BOTH LONG
TO SEE YOU OF ALL THINGS, FOR THEY HAVE HEARD AT EXETER
THAT YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURES IN THE WORLD;
AND I HAVE TOLD THEM IT IS ALL VERY TRUE, AND A GREAT
DEAL MORE.  YOU WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH THEM I AM SURE.
THEY HAVE BROUGHT THE WHOLE COACH FULL OF PLAYTHINGS
FOR THE CHILDREN.  HOW CAN YOU BE SO CROSS AS NOT TO COME?
WHY THEY ARE YOUR COUSINS, YOU KNOW, AFTER A FASHION.
YOU ARE MY COUSINS, AND THEY ARE MY WIFE'S, SO YOU MUST
BE RELATED."

BUT SIR JOHN COULD NOT PREVAIL.  HE COULD ONLY OBTAIN
A PROMISE OF THEIR CALLING AT THE PARK WITHIN A DAY OR TWO,
AND THEN LEFT THEM IN AMAZEMENT AT THEIR INDIFFERENCE,
TO WALK HOME AND BOAST ANEW OF THEIR ATTRACTIONS TO THE
MISS STEELES, AS HE HAD BEEN ALREADY BOASTING OF THE MISS
STEELES TO THEM.

WHEN THEIR PROMISED VISIT TO THE PARK AND CONSEQUENT
INTRODUCTION TO THESE YOUNG LADIES TOOK PLACE, THEY FOUND
IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE ELDEST, WHO WAS NEARLY THIRTY,
WITH A VERY PLAIN AND NOT A SENSIBLE FACE, NOTHING TO ADMIRE;
BUT IN THE OTHER, WHO WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO OR THREE
AND TWENTY, THEY ACKNOWLEDGED CONSIDERABLE BEAUTY; HER
FEATURES WERE PRETTY, AND SHE HAD A SHARP QUICK EYE,
AND A SMARTNESS OF AIR, WHICH THOUGH IT DID NOT GIVE
ACTUAL ELEGANCE OR GRACE, GAVE DISTINCTION TO HER PERSON.--
THEIR MANNERS WERE PARTICULARLY CIVIL, AND ELINOR SOON
ALLOWED THEM CREDIT FOR SOME KIND OF SENSE, WHEN SHE
SAW WITH WHAT CONSTANT AND JUDICIOUS ATTENTION THEY
WERE MAKING THEMSELVES AGREEABLE TO LADY MIDDLETON.
WITH HER CHILDREN THEY WERE IN CONTINUAL RAPTURES,
EXTOLLING THEIR BEAUTY, COURTING THEIR NOTICE, AND HUMOURING
THEIR WHIMS; AND SUCH OF THEIR TIME AS COULD BE SPARED FROM
THE IMPORTUNATE DEMANDS WHICH THIS POLITENESS MADE ON IT,
WAS SPENT IN ADMIRATION OF WHATEVER HER LADYSHIP WAS DOING,
IF SHE HAPPENED TO BE DOING ANY THING, OR IN TAKING PATTERNS
OF SOME ELEGANT NEW DRESS, IN WHICH HER APPEARANCE
THE DAY BEFORE HAD THROWN THEM INTO UNCEASING DELIGHT.
FORTUNATELY FOR THOSE WHO PAY THEIR COURT THROUGH
SUCH FOIBLES, A FOND MOTHER, THOUGH, IN PURSUIT OF PRAISE
FOR HER CHILDREN, THE MOST RAPACIOUS OF HUMAN BEINGS,
IS LIKEWISE THE MOST CREDULOUS; HER DEMANDS ARE EXORBITANT;
BUT SHE WILL SWALLOW ANY THING; AND THE EXCESSIVE
AFFECTION AND ENDURANCE OF THE MISS STEELES TOWARDS
HER OFFSPRING WERE VIEWED THEREFORE BY LADY MIDDLETON
WITHOUT THE SMALLEST SURPRISE OR DISTRUST.  SHE SAW WITH
MATERNAL COMPLACENCY ALL THE IMPERTINENT ENCROACHMENTS
AND MISCHIEVOUS TRICKS TO WHICH HER COUSINS SUBMITTED.
SHE SAW THEIR SASHES UNTIED, THEIR HAIR PULLED ABOUT
THEIR EARS, THEIR WORK-BAGS SEARCHED, AND THEIR KNIVES
AND SCISSORS STOLEN AWAY, AND FELT NO DOUBT OF ITS BEING
A RECIPROCAL ENJOYMENT.  IT SUGGESTED NO OTHER SURPRISE
THAN THAT ELINOR AND MARIANNE SHOULD SIT SO COMPOSEDLY BY,
WITHOUT CLAIMING A SHARE IN WHAT WAS PASSING.

"JOHN IS IN SUCH SPIRITS TODAY!" SAID SHE, ON HIS
TAKING MISS STEELES'S POCKET HANDKERCHIEF, AND THROWING
IT OUT OF WINDOW--"HE IS FULL OF MONKEY TRICKS."

AND SOON AFTERWARDS, ON THE SECOND BOY'S VIOLENTLY
PINCHING ONE OF THE SAME LADY'S FINGERS, SHE FONDLY OBSERVED,
"HOW PLAYFUL WILLIAM IS!"

"AND HERE IS MY SWEET LITTLE ANNAMARIA," SHE ADDED,
TENDERLY CARESSING A LITTLE GIRL OF THREE YEARS OLD,
WHO HAD NOT MADE A NOISE FOR THE LAST TWO MINUTES;
"AND SHE IS ALWAYS SO GENTLE AND QUIET--NEVER WAS THERE
SUCH A QUIET LITTLE THING!"

BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN BESTOWING THESE EMBRACES,
A PIN IN HER LADYSHIP'S HEAD DRESS SLIGHTLY SCRATCHING
THE CHILD'S NECK, PRODUCED FROM THIS PATTERN OF GENTLENESS
SUCH VIOLENT SCREAMS, AS COULD HARDLY BE OUTDONE BY ANY
CREATURE PROFESSEDLY NOISY.  THE MOTHER'S CONSTERNATION
WAS EXCESSIVE; BUT IT COULD NOT SURPASS THE ALARM OF THE
MISS STEELES, AND EVERY THING WAS DONE BY ALL THREE,
IN SO CRITICAL AN EMERGENCY, WHICH AFFECTION COULD SUGGEST
AS LIKELY TO ASSUAGE THE AGONIES OF THE LITTLE SUFFERER.
SHE WAS SEATED IN HER MOTHER'S LAP, COVERED WITH KISSES,
HER WOUND BATHED WITH LAVENDER-WATER, BY ONE OF THE
MISS STEELES, WHO WAS ON HER KNEES TO ATTEND HER,
AND HER MOUTH STUFFED WITH SUGAR PLUMS BY THE OTHER.
WITH SUCH A REWARD FOR HER TEARS, THE CHILD WAS TOO WISE
TO CEASE CRYING.  SHE STILL SCREAMED AND SOBBED LUSTILY,
KICKED HER TWO BROTHERS FOR OFFERING TO TOUCH HER, AND ALL
THEIR UNITED SOOTHINGS WERE INEFFECTUAL TILL LADY MIDDLETON
LUCKILY REMEMBERING THAT IN A SCENE OF SIMILAR DISTRESS
LAST WEEK, SOME APRICOT MARMALADE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY
APPLIED FOR A BRUISED TEMPLE, THE SAME REMEDY WAS EAGERLY
PROPOSED FOR THIS UNFORTUNATE SCRATCH, AND A SLIGHT
INTERMISSION OF SCREAMS IN THE YOUNG LADY ON HEARING IT,
GAVE THEM REASON TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE REJECTED.--
SHE WAS CARRIED OUT OF THE ROOM THEREFORE IN HER
MOTHER'S ARMS, IN QUEST OF THIS MEDICINE, AND AS THE
TWO BOYS CHOSE TO FOLLOW, THOUGH EARNESTLY ENTREATED
BY THEIR MOTHER TO STAY BEHIND, THE FOUR YOUNG LADIES
WERE LEFT IN A QUIETNESS WHICH THE ROOM HAD NOT KNOWN FOR
MANY HOURS.

"POOR LITTLE CREATURES!" SAID MISS STEELE, AS SOON
AS THEY WERE GONE.  "IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A VERY SAD ACCIDENT."

"YET I HARDLY KNOW HOW," CRIED MARIANNE, "UNLESS IT
HAD BEEN UNDER TOTALLY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
BUT THIS IS THE USUAL WAY OF HEIGHTENING ALARM, WHERE THERE
IS NOTHING TO BE ALARMED AT IN REALITY."

"WHAT A SWEET WOMAN LADY MIDDLETON IS!" SAID LUCY STEELE.

MARIANNE WAS SILENT; IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO SAY
WHAT SHE DID NOT FEEL, HOWEVER TRIVIAL THE OCCASION;
AND UPON ELINOR THEREFORE THE WHOLE TASK OF TELLING LIES
WHEN POLITENESS REQUIRED IT, ALWAYS FELL.  SHE DID HER
BEST WHEN THUS CALLED ON, BY SPEAKING OF LADY MIDDLETON
WITH MORE WARMTH THAN SHE FELT, THOUGH WITH FAR LESS THAN
MISS LUCY.

"AND SIR JOHN TOO," CRIED THE ELDER SISTER,
"WHAT A CHARMING MAN HE IS!"

HERE TOO, MISS DASHWOOD'S COMMENDATION, BEING ONLY
SIMPLE AND JUST, CAME IN WITHOUT ANY ECLAT.  SHE MERELY
OBSERVED THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY GOOD HUMOURED AND FRIENDLY.

"AND WHAT A CHARMING LITTLE FAMILY THEY HAVE!  I
NEVER SAW SUCH FINE CHILDREN IN MY LIFE.--I DECLARE I
QUITE DOAT UPON THEM ALREADY, AND INDEED I AM ALWAYS
DISTRACTEDLY FOND OF CHILDREN."

"I SHOULD GUESS SO," SAID ELINOR, WITH A SMILE,
"FROM WHAT I HAVE WITNESSED THIS MORNING."

"I HAVE A NOTION," SAID LUCY, "YOU THINK THE LITTLE
MIDDLETONS RATHER TOO MUCH INDULGED; PERHAPS THEY MAY BE THE
OUTSIDE OF ENOUGH; BUT IT IS SO NATURAL IN LADY MIDDLETON;
AND FOR MY PART, I LOVE TO SEE CHILDREN FULL OF LIFE
AND SPIRITS; I CANNOT BEAR THEM IF THEY ARE TAME AND QUIET."

"I CONFESS," REPLIED ELINOR, "THAT WHILE I AM AT
BARTON PARK, I NEVER THINK OF TAME AND QUIET CHILDREN
WITH ANY ABHORRENCE."

A SHORT PAUSE SUCCEEDED THIS SPEECH, WHICH WAS FIRST
BROKEN BY MISS STEELE, WHO SEEMED VERY MUCH DISPOSED
FOR CONVERSATION, AND WHO NOW SAID RATHER ABRUPTLY,
"AND HOW DO YOU LIKE DEVONSHIRE, MISS DASHWOOD?  I SUPPOSE
YOU WERE VERY SORRY TO LEAVE SUSSEX."

IN SOME SURPRISE AT THE FAMILIARITY OF THIS QUESTION,
OR AT LEAST OF THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS SPOKEN,
ELINOR REPLIED THAT SHE WAS.

"NORLAND IS A PRODIGIOUS BEAUTIFUL PLACE, IS NOT IT?"
ADDED MISS STEELE.

"WE HAVE HEARD SIR JOHN ADMIRE IT EXCESSIVELY,"
SAID LUCY, WHO SEEMED TO THINK SOME APOLOGY NECESSARY
FOR THE FREEDOM OF HER SISTER.

"I THINK EVERY ONE MUST ADMIRE IT," REPLIED ELINOR,
"WHO EVER SAW THE PLACE; THOUGH IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED
THAT ANY ONE CAN ESTIMATE ITS BEAUTIES AS WE DO."

"AND HAD YOU A GREAT MANY SMART BEAUX THERE?  I
SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOT SO MANY IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD;
FOR MY PART, I THINK THEY ARE A VAST ADDITION ALWAYS."

"BUT WHY SHOULD YOU THINK," SAID LUCY, LOOKING ASHAMED
OF HER SISTER, "THAT THERE ARE NOT AS MANY GENTEEL YOUNG
MEN IN DEVONSHIRE AS SUSSEX?"

"NAY, MY DEAR, I'M SURE I DON'T PRETEND TO SAY THAT THERE
AN'T.  I'M SURE THERE'S A VAST MANY SMART BEAUX IN EXETER;
BUT YOU KNOW, HOW COULD I TELL WHAT SMART BEAUX THERE
MIGHT BE ABOUT NORLAND; AND I WAS ONLY AFRAID THE MISS
DASHWOODS MIGHT FIND IT DULL AT BARTON, IF THEY HAD NOT
SO MANY AS THEY USED TO HAVE.  BUT PERHAPS YOU YOUNG LADIES
MAY NOT CARE ABOUT THE BEAUX, AND HAD AS LIEF BE WITHOUT
THEM AS WITH THEM.  FOR MY PART, I THINK THEY ARE VASTLY
AGREEABLE, PROVIDED THEY DRESS SMART AND BEHAVE CIVIL.
BUT I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE THEM DIRTY AND NASTY.  NOW THERE'S
MR. ROSE AT EXETER, A PRODIGIOUS SMART YOUNG MAN,
QUITE A BEAU, CLERK TO MR. SIMPSON, YOU KNOW, AND YET IF YOU
DO BUT MEET HIM OF A MORNING, HE IS NOT FIT TO BE SEEN.--
I SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER WAS QUITE A BEAU, MISS DASHWOOD,
BEFORE HE MARRIED, AS HE WAS SO RICH?"

"UPON MY WORD," REPLIED ELINOR, "I CANNOT TELL YOU,
FOR I DO NOT PERFECTLY COMPREHEND THE MEANING OF THE WORD.
BUT THIS I CAN SAY, THAT IF HE EVER WAS A BEAU BEFORE
HE MARRIED, HE IS ONE STILL FOR THERE IS NOT THE SMALLEST
ALTERATION IN HIM."

"OH! DEAR! ONE NEVER THINKS OF MARRIED MEN'S BEING
BEAUX--THEY HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO."

"LORD! ANNE," CRIED HER SISTER, "YOU CAN TALK OF
NOTHING BUT BEAUX;--YOU WILL MAKE MISS DASHWOOD BELIEVE YOU
THINK OF NOTHING ELSE." AND THEN TO TURN THE DISCOURSE,
SHE BEGAN ADMIRING THE HOUSE AND THE FURNITURE.

THIS SPECIMEN OF THE MISS STEELES WAS ENOUGH.
THE VULGAR FREEDOM AND FOLLY OF THE ELDEST LEFT
HER NO RECOMMENDATION, AND AS ELINOR WAS NOT BLINDED
BY THE BEAUTY, OR THE SHREWD LOOK OF THE YOUNGEST,
TO HER WANT OF REAL ELEGANCE AND ARTLESSNESS, SHE LEFT
THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY WISH OF KNOWING THEM BETTER.

NOT SO THE MISS STEELES.--THEY CAME FROM EXETER, WELL
PROVIDED WITH ADMIRATION FOR THE USE OF SIR JOHN MIDDLETON,
HIS FAMILY, AND ALL HIS RELATIONS, AND NO NIGGARDLY
PROPORTION WAS NOW DEALT OUT TO HIS FAIR COUSINS, WHOM THEY
DECLARED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, ELEGANT, ACCOMPLISHED,
AND AGREEABLE GIRLS THEY HAD EVER BEHELD, AND WITH WHOM
THEY WERE PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO BE BETTER ACQUAINTED.--
AND TO BE BETTER ACQUAINTED THEREFORE, ELINOR SOON FOUND
WAS THEIR INEVITABLE LOT, FOR AS SIR JOHN WAS ENTIRELY
ON THE SIDE OF THE MISS STEELES, THEIR PARTY WOULD BE
TOO STRONG FOR OPPOSITION, AND THAT KIND OF INTIMACY
MUST BE SUBMITTED TO, WHICH CONSISTS OF SITTING AN HOUR
OR TWO TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM ALMOST EVERY DAY.
SIR JOHN COULD DO NO MORE; BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT ANY
MORE WAS REQUIRED: TO BE TOGETHER WAS, IN HIS OPINION,
TO BE INTIMATE, AND WHILE HIS CONTINUAL SCHEMES FOR THEIR
MEETING WERE EFFECTUAL, HE HAD NOT A DOUBT OF THEIR BEING
ESTABLISHED FRIENDS.

TO DO HIM JUSTICE, HE DID EVERY THING IN HIS POWER
TO PROMOTE THEIR UNRESERVE, BY MAKING THE MISS STEELES
ACQUAINTED WITH WHATEVER HE KNEW OR SUPPOSED OF HIS COUSINS'
SITUATIONS IN THE MOST DELICATE PARTICULARS,--AND ELINOR
HAD NOT SEEN THEM MORE THAN TWICE, BEFORE THE ELDEST OF
THEM WISHED HER JOY ON HER SISTER'S HAVING BEEN SO LUCKY
AS TO MAKE A CONQUEST OF A VERY SMART BEAU SINCE SHE
CAME TO BARTON.

"'TWILL BE A FINE THING TO HAVE HER MARRIED SO YOUNG
TO BE SURE," SAID SHE, "AND I HEAR HE IS QUITE A BEAU,
AND PRODIGIOUS HANDSOME.  AND I HOPE YOU MAY HAVE AS GOOD
LUCK YOURSELF SOON,--BUT PERHAPS YOU MAY HAVE A FRIEND
IN THE CORNER ALREADY."

ELINOR COULD NOT SUPPOSE THAT SIR JOHN WOULD BE MORE
NICE IN PROCLAIMING HIS SUSPICIONS OF HER REGARD FOR EDWARD,
THAN HE HAD BEEN WITH RESPECT TO MARIANNE; INDEED IT WAS
RATHER HIS FAVOURITE JOKE OF THE TWO, AS BEING SOMEWHAT
NEWER AND MORE CONJECTURAL; AND SINCE EDWARD'S VISIT,
THEY HAD NEVER DINED TOGETHER WITHOUT HIS DRINKING TO HER
BEST AFFECTIONS WITH SO MUCH SIGNIFICANCY AND SO MANY NODS
AND WINKS, AS TO EXCITE GENERAL ATTENTION.  THE LETTER F--
HAD BEEN LIKEWISE INVARIABLY BROUGHT FORWARD, AND FOUND
PRODUCTIVE OF SUCH COUNTLESS JOKES, THAT ITS CHARACTER
AS THE WITTIEST LETTER IN THE ALPHABET HAD BEEN LONG
ESTABLISHED WITH ELINOR.

THE MISS STEELES, AS SHE EXPECTED, HAD NOW ALL THE
BENEFIT OF THESE JOKES, AND IN THE ELDEST OF THEM THEY
RAISED A CURIOSITY TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN
ALLUDED TO, WHICH, THOUGH OFTEN IMPERTINENTLY EXPRESSED,
WAS PERFECTLY OF A PIECE WITH HER GENERAL INQUISITIVENESS
INTO THE CONCERNS OF THEIR FAMILY.  BUT SIR JOHN DID NOT
SPORT LONG WITH THE CURIOSITY WHICH HE DELIGHTED TO RAISE,
FOR HE HAD AT LEAST AS MUCH PLEASURE IN TELLING THE NAME,
AS MISS STEELE HAD IN HEARING IT.

"HIS NAME IS FERRARS," SAID HE, IN A VERY AUDIBLE WHISPER;
"BUT PRAY DO NOT TELL IT, FOR IT'S A GREAT SECRET."

"FERRARS!" REPEATED MISS STEELE; "MR. FERRARS IS
THE HAPPY MAN, IS HE? WHAT! YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW'S BROTHER,
MISS DASHWOOD? A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE;
I KNOW HIM VERY WELL."

"HOW CAN YOU SAY SO, ANNE?" CRIED LUCY, WHO GENERALLY
MADE AN AMENDMENT TO ALL HER SISTER'S ASSERTIONS.
"THOUGH WE HAVE SEEN HIM ONCE OR TWICE AT MY UNCLE'S, IT
IS RATHER TOO MUCH TO PRETEND TO KNOW HIM VERY WELL."

ELINOR HEARD ALL THIS WITH ATTENTION AND SURPRISE.
"AND WHO WAS THIS UNCLE?  WHERE DID HE LIVE?  HOW CAME
THEY ACQUAINTED?"  SHE WISHED VERY MUCH TO HAVE THE SUBJECT
CONTINUED, THOUGH SHE DID NOT CHUSE TO JOIN IN IT HERSELF;
BUT NOTHING MORE OF IT WAS SAID, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN HER LIFE, SHE THOUGHT MRS. JENNINGS DEFICIENT EITHER
IN CURIOSITY AFTER PETTY INFORMATION, OR IN A DISPOSITION
TO COMMUNICATE IT.  THE MANNER IN WHICH MISS STEELE HAD
SPOKEN OF EDWARD, INCREASED HER CURIOSITY; FOR IT STRUCK
HER AS BEING RATHER ILL-NATURED, AND SUGGESTED THE SUSPICION
OF THAT LADY'S KNOWING, OR FANCYING HERSELF TO KNOW SOMETHING
TO HIS DISADVANTAGE.--BUT HER CURIOSITY WAS UNAVAILING,
FOR NO FARTHER NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF MR. FERRARS'S NAME BY
MISS STEELE WHEN ALLUDED TO, OR EVEN OPENLY MENTIONED BY SIR
JOHN.



CHAPTER 22


MARIANNE, WHO HAD NEVER MUCH TOLERATION FOR ANY
THING LIKE IMPERTINENCE, VULGARITY, INFERIORITY OF PARTS,
OR EVEN DIFFERENCE OF TASTE FROM HERSELF, WAS AT
THIS TIME PARTICULARLY ILL-DISPOSED, FROM THE STATE
OF HER SPIRITS, TO BE PLEASED WITH THE MISS STEELES,
OR TO ENCOURAGE THEIR ADVANCES; AND TO THE INVARIABLE
COLDNESS OF HER BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS THEM, WHICH CHECKED EVERY
ENDEAVOUR AT INTIMACY ON THEIR SIDE, ELINOR PRINCIPALLY
ATTRIBUTED THAT PREFERENCE OF HERSELF WHICH SOON BECAME
EVIDENT IN THE MANNERS OF BOTH, BUT ESPECIALLY OF LUCY,
WHO MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF ENGAGING HER IN CONVERSATION,
OR OF STRIVING TO IMPROVE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE BY AN EASY
AND FRANK COMMUNICATION OF HER SENTIMENTS.

LUCY WAS NATURALLY CLEVER; HER REMARKS WERE OFTEN
JUST AND AMUSING; AND AS A COMPANION FOR HALF AN HOUR
ELINOR FREQUENTLY FOUND HER AGREEABLE; BUT HER POWERS
HAD RECEIVED NO AID FROM EDUCATION: SHE WAS IGNORANT
AND ILLITERATE; AND HER DEFICIENCY OF ALL MENTAL IMPROVEMENT,
HER WANT OF INFORMATION IN THE MOST COMMON PARTICULARS,
COULD NOT BE CONCEALED FROM MISS DASHWOOD, IN SPITE OF HER
CONSTANT ENDEAVOUR TO APPEAR TO ADVANTAGE.  ELINOR SAW,
AND PITIED HER FOR, THE NEGLECT OF ABILITIES WHICH EDUCATION
MIGHT HAVE RENDERED SO RESPECTABLE; BUT SHE SAW, WITH LESS
TENDERNESS OF FEELING, THE THOROUGH WANT OF DELICACY,
OF RECTITUDE, AND INTEGRITY OF MIND, WHICH HER ATTENTIONS,
HER ASSIDUITIES, HER FLATTERIES AT THE PARK BETRAYED;
AND SHE COULD HAVE NO LASTING SATISFACTION IN THE COMPANY
OF A PERSON WHO JOINED INSINCERITY WITH IGNORANCE;
WHOSE WANT OF INSTRUCTION PREVENTED THEIR MEETING
IN CONVERSATION ON TERMS OF EQUALITY, AND WHOSE CONDUCT
TOWARD OTHERS MADE EVERY SHEW OF ATTENTION AND DEFERENCE
TOWARDS HERSELF PERFECTLY VALUELESS.

"YOU WILL THINK MY QUESTION AN ODD ONE, I DARE SAY,"
SAID LUCY TO HER ONE DAY, AS THEY WERE WALKING TOGETHER
FROM THE PARK TO THE COTTAGE--"BUT PRAY, ARE YOU
PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW'S MOTHER,
MRS. FERRARS?"

ELINOR DID THINK THE QUESTION A VERY ODD ONE,
AND HER COUNTENANCE EXPRESSED IT, AS SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE
HAD NEVER SEEN MRS. FERRARS.

"INDEED!" REPLIED LUCY; "I WONDER AT THAT, FOR I
THOUGHT YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HER AT NORLAND SOMETIMES.
THEN, PERHAPS, YOU CANNOT TELL ME WHAT SORT OF A WOMAN
SHE IS?"

"NO," RETURNED ELINOR, CAUTIOUS OF GIVING HER REAL
OPINION OF EDWARD'S MOTHER, AND NOT VERY DESIROUS
OF SATISFYING WHAT SEEMED IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY--
"I KNOW NOTHING OF HER."

"I AM SURE YOU THINK ME VERY STRANGE, FOR ENQUIRING
ABOUT HER IN SUCH A WAY," SAID LUCY, EYEING ELINOR ATTENTIVELY
AS SHE SPOKE; "BUT PERHAPS THERE MAY BE REASONS--I WISH
I MIGHT VENTURE; BUT HOWEVER I HOPE YOU WILL DO ME THE JUSTICE
OF BELIEVING THAT I DO NOT MEAN TO BE IMPERTINENT."

ELINOR MADE HER A CIVIL REPLY, AND THEY WALKED ON
FOR A FEW MINUTES IN SILENCE.  IT WAS BROKEN BY LUCY,
WHO RENEWED THE SUBJECT AGAIN BY SAYING, WITH SOME
HESITATION,

"I CANNOT BEAR TO HAVE YOU THINK ME IMPERTINENTLY CURIOUS.
I AM SURE I WOULD RATHER DO ANY THING IN THE WORLD THAN BE
THOUGHT SO BY A PERSON WHOSE GOOD OPINION IS SO WELL WORTH
HAVING AS YOURS.  AND I AM SURE I SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SMALLEST
FEAR OF TRUSTING YOU; INDEED, I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF YOUR
ADVICE HOW TO MANAGE IN SUCH AND UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION
AS I AM; BUT, HOWEVER, THERE IS NO OCCASION TO TROUBLE YOU.
I AM SORRY YOU DO NOT HAPPEN TO KNOW MRS. FERRARS."

"I AM SORRY I DO NOT," SAID ELINOR, IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT,
"IF IT COULD BE OF ANY USE TO YOU TO KNOW MY OPINION OF HER.
BUT REALLY I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU WERE AT ALL CONNECTED
WITH THAT FAMILY, AND THEREFORE I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED,
I CONFESS, AT SO SERIOUS AN INQUIRY INTO HER CHARACTER."

"I DARE SAY YOU ARE, AND I AM SURE I DO NOT AT ALL
WONDER AT IT.  BUT IF I DARED TELL YOU ALL, YOU WOULD NOT BE
SO MUCH SURPRISED.  MRS. FERRARS IS CERTAINLY NOTHING TO ME
AT PRESENT--BUT THE TIME MAY COME--HOW SOON IT WILL COME
MUST DEPEND UPON HERSELF--WHEN WE MAY BE VERY INTIMATELY
CONNECTED."

SHE LOOKED DOWN AS SHE SAID THIS, AMIABLY BASHFUL,
WITH ONLY ONE SIDE GLANCE AT HER COMPANION TO OBSERVE ITS
EFFECT ON HER.

"GOOD HEAVENS!" CRIED ELINOR, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ARE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH MR. ROBERT FERRARS?  CAN YOU BE?"
AND SHE DID NOT FEEL MUCH DELIGHTED WITH THE IDEA OF SUCH
A SISTER-IN-LAW.

"NO," REPLIED LUCY, "NOT TO MR. ROBERT FERRARS--I
NEVER SAW HIM IN MY LIFE; BUT," FIXING HER EYES UPON ELINOR,
"TO HIS ELDEST BROTHER."

WHAT FELT ELINOR AT THAT MOMENT? ASTONISHMENT,
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS PAINFUL AS IT WAS STRONG, HAD NOT
AN IMMEDIATE DISBELIEF OF THE ASSERTION ATTENDED IT.
SHE TURNED TOWARDS LUCY IN SILENT AMAZEMENT, UNABLE TO DIVINE
THE REASON OR OBJECT OF SUCH A DECLARATION; AND THOUGH
HER COMPLEXION VARIED, SHE STOOD FIRM IN INCREDULITY,
AND FELT IN NO DANGER OF AN HYSTERICAL FIT, OR A SWOON.

"YOU MAY WELL BE SURPRISED," CONTINUED LUCY;
"FOR TO BE SURE YOU COULD HAVE HAD NO IDEA OF IT BEFORE;
FOR I DARE SAY HE NEVER DROPPED THE SMALLEST HINT OF IT
TO YOU OR ANY OF YOUR FAMILY; BECAUSE IT WAS ALWAYS MEANT
TO BE A GREAT SECRET, AND I AM SURE HAS BEEN FAITHFULLY
KEPT SO BY ME TO THIS HOUR.  NOT A SOUL OF ALL MY RELATIONS
KNOW OF IT BUT ANNE, AND I NEVER SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED
IT TO YOU, IF I HAD NOT FELT THE GREATEST DEPENDENCE
IN THE WORLD UPON YOUR SECRECY; AND I REALLY THOUGHT MY
BEHAVIOUR IN ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MRS. FERRARS
MUST SEEM SO ODD, THAT IT OUGHT TO BE EXPLAINED.
AND I DO NOT THINK MR. FERRARS CAN BE DISPLEASED,
WHEN HE KNOWS I HAVE TRUSTED YOU, BECAUSE I KNOW HE HAS
THE HIGHEST OPINION IN THE WORLD OF ALL YOUR FAMILY,
AND LOOKS UPON YOURSELF AND THE OTHER MISS DASHWOODS QUITE
AS HIS OWN SISTERS."--SHE PAUSED.

ELINOR FOR A FEW MOMENTS REMAINED SILENT.
HER ASTONISHMENT AT WHAT SHE HEARD WAS AT FIRST TOO
GREAT FOR WORDS; BUT AT LENGTH FORCING HERSELF TO SPEAK,
AND TO SPEAK CAUTIOUSLY, SHE SAID, WITH CALMNESS OF MANNER,
WHICH TOLERABLY WELL CONCEALED HER SURPRISE AND SOLICITUDE--
"MAY I ASK IF YOUR ENGAGEMENT IS OF LONG STANDING?"

"WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED THESE FOUR YEARS."

"FOUR YEARS!"

"YES."

ELINOR, THOUGH GREATLY SHOCKED, STILL FELT UNABLE
TO BELIEVE IT.

"I DID NOT KNOW," SAID SHE, "THAT YOU WERE EVEN
ACQUAINTED TILL THE OTHER DAY."

"OUR ACQUAINTANCE, HOWEVER, IS OF MANY YEARS DATE.
HE WAS UNDER MY UNCLE'S CARE, YOU KNOW, A CONSIDERABLE WHILE."

"YOUR UNCLE!"

"YES; MR. PRATT.  DID YOU NEVER HEAR HIM TALK
OF MR. PRATT?"

"I THINK I HAVE," REPLIED ELINOR, WITH AN EXERTION
OF SPIRITS, WHICH INCREASED WITH HER INCREASE OF EMOTION.

"HE WAS FOUR YEARS WITH MY UNCLE, WHO LIVES AT LONGSTAPLE,
NEAR PLYMOUTH.  IT WAS THERE OUR ACQUAINTANCE BEGUN,
FOR MY SISTER AND ME WAS OFTEN STAYING WITH MY UNCLE,
AND IT WAS THERE OUR ENGAGEMENT WAS FORMED, THOUGH NOT TILL
A YEAR AFTER HE HAD QUITTED AS A PUPIL; BUT HE WAS ALMOST
ALWAYS WITH US AFTERWARDS.  I WAS VERY UNWILLING TO ENTER
INTO IT, AS YOU MAY IMAGINE, WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND
APPROBATION OF HIS MOTHER; BUT I WAS TOO YOUNG, AND LOVED
HIM TOO WELL, TO BE SO PRUDENT AS I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN.--
THOUGH YOU DO NOT KNOW HIM SO WELL AS ME, MISS DASHWOOD,
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF HIM TO BE SENSIBLE HE IS
VERY CAPABLE OF MAKING A WOMAN SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HIM."

"CERTAINLY," ANSWERED ELINOR, WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT
SHE SAID; BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION, SHE ADDED,
WITH REVIVED SECURITY OF EDWARD'S HONOUR AND LOVE,
AND HER COMPANION'S FALSEHOOD--"ENGAGED TO MR. EDWARD
FERRARS!--I CONFESS MYSELF SO TOTALLY SURPRISED AT
WHAT YOU TELL ME, THAT REALLY--I BEG YOUR PARDON;
BUT SURELY THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE OF PERSON OR NAME.
WE CANNOT MEAN THE SAME MR. FERRARS."

"WE CAN MEAN NO OTHER," CRIED LUCY, SMILING.  "MR. EDWARD
FERRARS, THE ELDEST SON OF MRS. FERRARS, OF PARK STREET,
AND BROTHER OF YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW, MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD,
IS THE PERSON I MEAN; YOU MUST ALLOW THAT I AM NOT LIKELY
TO BE DECEIVED AS TO THE NAME OF THE MAN ON WHO ALL MY HAPPINESS
DEPENDS."

"IT IS STRANGE," REPLIED ELINOR, IN A MOST PAINFUL PERPLEXITY,
"THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD HIM EVEN MENTION YOUR NAME."

"NO; CONSIDERING OUR SITUATION, IT WAS NOT STRANGE.
OUR FIRST CARE HAS BEEN TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET.--
YOU KNEW NOTHING OF ME, OR MY FAMILY, AND, THEREFORE,
THERE COULD BE NO OCCASION FOR EVER MENTIONING MY NAME
TO YOU; AND, AS HE WAS ALWAYS PARTICULARLY AFRAID OF HIS
SISTER'S SUSPECTING ANY THING, THAT WAS REASON ENOUGH
FOR HIS NOT MENTIONING IT."

SHE WAS SILENT.--ELINOR'S SECURITY SUNK; BUT HER
SELF-COMMAND DID NOT SINK WITH IT.

"FOUR YEARS YOU HAVE BEEN ENGAGED," SAID SHE
WITH A FIRM VOICE.

"YES; AND HEAVEN KNOWS HOW MUCH LONGER WE MAY HAVE
TO WAIT.  POOR EDWARD!  IT PUTS HIM QUITE OUT OF HEART."
THEN TAKING A SMALL MINIATURE FROM HER POCKET, SHE ADDED,
"TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTAKE, BE SO GOOD AS TO LOOK
AT THIS FACE.  IT DOES NOT DO HIM JUSTICE, TO BE SURE,
BUT YET I THINK YOU CANNOT BE DECEIVED AS TO THE PERSON
IT WAS DREW FOR.--I HAVE HAD IT ABOVE THESE THREE YEARS."

SHE PUT IT INTO HER HANDS AS SHE SPOKE; AND WHEN ELINOR
SAW THE PAINTING, WHATEVER OTHER DOUBTS HER FEAR OF A
TOO HASTY DECISION, OR HER WISH OF DETECTING FALSEHOOD
MIGHT SUFFER TO LINGER IN HER MIND, SHE COULD HAVE NONE OF
ITS BEING EDWARD'S FACE.  SHE RETURNED IT ALMOST INSTANTLY,
ACKNOWLEDGING THE LIKENESS.

"I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE," CONTINUED LUCY, "TO GIVE
HIM MY PICTURE IN RETURN, WHICH I AM VERY MUCH VEXED AT,
FOR HE HAS BEEN ALWAYS SO ANXIOUS TO GET IT!  BUT I AM
DETERMINED TO SET FOR IT THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY."

"YOU ARE QUITE IN THE RIGHT," REPLIED ELINOR CALMLY.
THEY THEN PROCEEDED A FEW PACES IN SILENCE.  LUCY SPOKE FIRST.

"I AM SURE," SAID SHE, "I HAVE NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD
OF YOUR FAITHFULLY KEEPING THIS SECRET, BECAUSE YOU MUST
KNOW OF WHAT IMPORTANCE IT IS TO US, NOT TO HAVE IT REACH
HIS MOTHER; FOR SHE WOULD NEVER APPROVE OF IT, I DARE SAY.
I SHALL HAVE NO FORTUNE, AND I FANCY SHE IS AN EXCEEDING
PROUD WOMAN."

"I CERTAINLY DID NOT SEEK YOUR CONFIDENCE," SAID ELINOR;
"BUT YOU DO ME NO MORE THAN JUSTICE IN IMAGINING THAT I
MAY BE DEPENDED ON.  YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME;
BUT PARDON ME IF I EXPRESS SOME SURPRISE AT SO UNNECESSARY
A COMMUNICATION.  YOU MUST AT LEAST HAVE FELT THAT MY
BEING ACQUAINTED WITH IT COULD NOT ADD TO ITS SAFETY."

AS SHE SAID THIS, SHE LOOKED EARNESTLY AT LUCY,
HOPING TO DISCOVER SOMETHING IN HER COUNTENANCE; PERHAPS THE
FALSEHOOD OF THE GREATEST PART OF WHAT SHE HAD BEEN SAYING;
BUT LUCY'S COUNTENANCE SUFFERED NO CHANGE.

"I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD THINK I WAS TAKING A GREAT
LIBERTY WITH YOU," SAID SHE, "IN TELLING YOU ALL THIS.
I HAVE NOT KNOWN YOU LONG TO BE SURE, PERSONALLY AT LEAST,
BUT I HAVE KNOWN YOU AND ALL YOUR FAMILY BY DESCRIPTION
A GREAT WHILE; AND AS SOON AS I SAW YOU, I FELT ALMOST AS IF
YOU WAS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.  BESIDES IN THE PRESENT CASE,
I REALLY THOUGHT SOME EXPLANATION WAS DUE TO YOU AFTER MY
MAKING SUCH PARTICULAR INQUIRIES ABOUT EDWARD'S MOTHER;
AND I AM SO UNFORTUNATE, THAT I HAVE NOT A CREATURE WHOSE
ADVICE I CAN ASK.  ANNE IS THE ONLY PERSON THAT KNOWS OF IT,
AND SHE HAS NO JUDGMENT AT ALL; INDEED, SHE DOES ME A GREAT
DEAL MORE HARM THAN GOOD, FOR I AM IN CONSTANT FEAR OF HER
BETRAYING ME.  SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO HOLD HER TONGUE,
AS YOU MUST PERCEIVE, AND I AM SURE I WAS IN THE GREATEST
FRIGHT IN THE WORLD T'OTHER DAY, WHEN EDWARD'S NAME WAS
MENTIONED BY SIR JOHN, LEST SHE SHOULD OUT WITH IT ALL.
YOU CAN'T THINK HOW MUCH I GO THROUGH IN MY MIND FROM
IT ALTOGETHER.  I ONLY WONDER THAT I AM ALIVE AFTER WHAT
I HAVE SUFFERED FOR EDWARD'S SAKE THESE LAST FOUR YEARS.
EVERY THING IN SUCH SUSPENSE AND UNCERTAINTY; AND SEEING
HIM SO SELDOM--WE CAN HARDLY MEET ABOVE TWICE A-YEAR.
I AM SURE I WONDER MY HEART IS NOT QUITE BROKE."

HERE SHE TOOK OUT HER HANDKERCHIEF; BUT ELINOR DID
NOT FEEL VERY COMPASSIONATE.

"SOMETIMES." CONTINUED LUCY, AFTER WIPING HER EYES,
"I THINK WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE BETTER FOR US BOTH
TO BREAK OFF THE MATTER ENTIRELY."  AS SHE SAID THIS,
SHE LOOKED DIRECTLY AT HER COMPANION.  "BUT THEN
AT OTHER TIMES I HAVE NOT RESOLUTION ENOUGH FOR IT.--
I CANNOT BEAR THE THOUGHTS OF MAKING HIM SO MISERABLE,
AS I KNOW THE VERY MENTION OF SUCH A THING WOULD DO.
AND ON MY OWN ACCOUNT TOO--SO DEAR AS HE IS TO ME--I DON'T
THINK I COULD BE EQUAL TO IT.  WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE
ME TO DO IN SUCH A CASE, MISS DASHWOOD?  WHAT WOULD YOU
DO YOURSELF?"

"PARDON ME," REPLIED ELINOR, STARTLED BY THE QUESTION;
"BUT I CAN GIVE YOU NO ADVICE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.
YOUR OWN JUDGMENT MUST DIRECT YOU."

"TO BE SURE," CONTINUED LUCY, AFTER A FEW MINUTES
SILENCE ON BOTH SIDES, "HIS MOTHER MUST PROVIDE FOR HIM
SOMETIME OR OTHER; BUT POOR EDWARD IS SO CAST DOWN BY IT!
DID YOU NOT THINK HIM DREADFUL LOW-SPIRITED WHEN HE WAS AT
BARTON?  HE WAS SO MISERABLE WHEN HE LEFT US AT LONGSTAPLE,
TO GO TO YOU, THAT I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD THINK HIM QUITE ILL."

"DID HE COME FROM YOUR UNCLE'S, THEN, WHEN HE VISITED US?"

"OH, YES; HE HAD BEEN STAYING A FORTNIGHT WITH US.
DID YOU THINK HE CAME DIRECTLY FROM TOWN?"

"NO," REPLIED ELINOR, MOST FEELINGLY SENSIBLE OF
EVERY FRESH CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOUR OF LUCY'S VERACITY;
"I REMEMBER HE TOLD US, THAT HE HAD BEEN STAYING
A FORTNIGHT WITH SOME FRIENDS NEAR PLYMOUTH."
SHE REMEMBERED TOO, HER OWN SURPRISE AT THE TIME,
AT HIS MENTIONING NOTHING FARTHER OF THOSE FRIENDS,
AT HIS TOTAL SILENCE WITH RESPECT EVEN TO THEIR NAMES.

"DID NOT YOU THINK HIM SADLY OUT OF SPIRITS?"
REPEATED LUCY.

"WE DID, INDEED, PARTICULARLY SO WHEN HE FIRST ARRIVED."

"I BEGGED HIM TO EXERT HIMSELF FOR FEAR YOU
SHOULD SUSPECT WHAT WAS THE MATTER; BUT IT MADE HIM
SO MELANCHOLY, NOT BEING ABLE TO STAY MORE THAN A
FORTNIGHT WITH US, AND SEEING ME SO MUCH AFFECTED.--
POOR FELLOW!--I AM AFRAID IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH HIM NOW;
FOR HE WRITES IN WRETCHED SPIRITS.  I HEARD FROM HIM JUST
BEFORE I LEFT EXETER;" TAKING A LETTER FROM HER POCKET
AND CARELESSLY SHOWING THE DIRECTION TO ELINOR.
"YOU KNOW HIS HAND, I DARE SAY, A CHARMING ONE IT IS;
BUT THAT IS NOT WRITTEN SO WELL AS USUAL.--HE WAS TIRED,
I DARE SAY, FOR HE HAD JUST FILLED THE SHEET TO ME AS FULL
AS POSSIBLE."

ELINOR SAW THAT IT WAS HIS HAND, AND SHE COULD DOUBT
NO LONGER.  THIS PICTURE, SHE HAD ALLOWED HERSELF TO BELIEVE,
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTALLY OBTAINED; IT MIGHT NOT HAVE
BEEN EDWARD'S GIFT; BUT A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEM
BY LETTER, COULD SUBSIST ONLY UNDER A POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT,
COULD BE AUTHORISED BY NOTHING ELSE; FOR A FEW MOMENTS, SHE
WAS ALMOST OVERCOME--HER HEART SUNK WITHIN HER, AND SHE COULD
HARDLY STAND; BUT EXERTION WAS INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY;
AND SHE STRUGGLED SO RESOLUTELY AGAINST THE OPPRESSION
OF HER FEELINGS, THAT HER SUCCESS WAS SPEEDY, AND FOR
THE TIME COMPLETE.

"WRITING TO EACH OTHER," SAID LUCY, RETURNING THE
LETTER INTO HER POCKET, "IS THE ONLY COMFORT WE HAVE
IN SUCH LONG SEPARATIONS.  YES, I HAVE ONE OTHER COMFORT
IN HIS PICTURE, BUT POOR EDWARD HAS NOT EVEN THAT.
IF HE HAD BUT MY PICTURE, HE SAYS HE SHOULD BE EASY.
I GAVE HIM A LOCK OF MY HAIR SET IN A RING WHEN HE WAS AT
LONGSTAPLE LAST, AND THAT WAS SOME COMFORT TO HIM, HE SAID,
BUT NOT EQUAL TO A PICTURE.  PERHAPS YOU MIGHT NOTICE
THE RING WHEN YOU SAW HIM?"

"I DID," SAID ELINOR, WITH A COMPOSURE OF VOICE,
UNDER WHICH WAS CONCEALED AN EMOTION AND DISTRESS BEYOND
ANY THING SHE HAD EVER FELT BEFORE.  SHE WAS MORTIFIED,
SHOCKED, CONFOUNDED.

FORTUNATELY FOR HER, THEY HAD NOW REACHED THE COTTAGE,
AND THE CONVERSATION COULD BE CONTINUED NO FARTHER.
AFTER SITTING WITH THEM A FEW MINUTES, THE MISS STEELES
RETURNED TO THE PARK, AND ELINOR WAS THEN AT LIBERTY
TO THINK AND BE WRETCHED.





[AT THIS POINT IN THE FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS, VOLUME 1 ENDS.]





CHAPTER 23


HOWEVER SMALL ELINOR'S GENERAL DEPENDENCE ON
LUCY'S VERACITY MIGHT BE, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER
ON SERIOUS REFLECTION TO SUSPECT IT IN THE PRESENT CASE,
WHERE NO TEMPTATION COULD BE ANSWERABLE TO THE FOLLY
OF INVENTING A FALSEHOOD OF SUCH A DESCRIPTION.  WHAT LUCY
HAD ASSERTED TO BE TRUE, THEREFORE, ELINOR COULD NOT,
DARED NOT LONGER DOUBT; SUPPORTED AS IT WAS TOO ON EVERY
SIDE BY SUCH PROBABILITIES AND PROOFS, AND CONTRADICTED
BY NOTHING BUT HER OWN WISHES.  THEIR OPPORTUNITY OF
ACQUAINTANCE IN THE HOUSE OF MR. PRATT WAS A FOUNDATION
FOR THE REST, AT ONCE INDISPUTABLE AND ALARMING; AND EDWARD'S
VISIT NEAR PLYMOUTH, HIS MELANCHOLY STATE OF MIND,
HIS DISSATISFACTION AT HIS OWN PROSPECTS, HIS UNCERTAIN
BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS HERSELF, THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE
MISS STEELES AS TO NORLAND AND THEIR FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
WHICH HAD OFTEN SURPRISED HER, THE PICTURE, THE LETTER,
THE RING, FORMED ALTOGETHER SUCH A BODY OF EVIDENCE,
AS OVERCAME EVERY FEAR OF CONDEMNING HIM UNFAIRLY,
AND ESTABLISHED AS A FACT, WHICH NO PARTIALITY COULD
SET ASIDE, HIS ILL-TREATMENT OF HERSELF.--HER RESENTMENT
OF SUCH BEHAVIOUR, HER INDIGNATION AT HAVING BEEN ITS DUPE,
FOR A SHORT TIME MADE HER FEEL ONLY FOR HERSELF;
BUT OTHER IDEAS, OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, SOON AROSE.
HAD EDWARD BEEN INTENTIONALLY DECEIVING HER?  HAD HE FEIGNED
A REGARD FOR HER WHICH HE DID NOT FEEL?  WAS HIS ENGAGEMENT
TO LUCY AN ENGAGEMENT OF THE HEART?  NO; WHATEVER IT MIGHT
ONCE HAVE BEEN, SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT SUCH AT PRESENT.
HIS AFFECTION WAS ALL HER OWN.  SHE COULD NOT BE DECEIVED
IN THAT.  HER MOTHER, SISTERS, FANNY, ALL HAD BEEN
CONSCIOUS OF HIS REGARD FOR HER AT NORLAND; IT WAS NOT
AN ILLUSION OF HER OWN VANITY.  HE CERTAINLY LOVED HER.
WHAT A SOFTENER OF THE HEART WAS THIS PERSUASION!  HOW MUCH
COULD IT NOT TEMPT HER TO FORGIVE!  HE HAD BEEN BLAMABLE,
HIGHLY BLAMABLE, IN REMAINING AT NORLAND AFTER HE FIRST
FELT HER INFLUENCE OVER HIM TO BE MORE THAN IT OUGHT
TO BE.  IN THAT, HE COULD NOT BE DEFENDED; BUT IF HE
HAD INJURED HER, HOW MUCH MORE HAD HE INJURED HIMSELF;
IF HER CASE WERE PITIABLE, HIS WAS HOPELESS.
HIS IMPRUDENCE HAD MADE HER MISERABLE FOR A WHILE; BUT IT
SEEMED TO HAVE DEPRIVED HIMSELF OF ALL CHANCE OF EVER
BEING OTHERWISE.  SHE MIGHT IN TIME REGAIN TRANQUILLITY;
BUT HE, WHAT HAD HE TO LOOK FORWARD TO?  COULD HE
EVER BE TOLERABLY HAPPY WITH LUCY STEELE; COULD HE,
WERE HIS AFFECTION FOR HERSELF OUT OF THE QUESTION,
WITH HIS INTEGRITY, HIS DELICACY, AND WELL-INFORMED MIND,
BE SATISFIED WITH A WIFE LIKE HER--ILLITERATE, ARTFUL,
AND SELFISH?

THE YOUTHFUL INFATUATION OF NINETEEN WOULD NATURALLY
BLIND HIM TO EVERY THING BUT HER BEAUTY AND GOOD NATURE;
BUT THE FOUR SUCCEEDING YEARS--YEARS, WHICH IF RATIONALLY
SPENT, GIVE SUCH IMPROVEMENT TO THE UNDERSTANDING, MUST
HAVE OPENED HIS EYES TO HER DEFECTS OF EDUCATION,
WHILE THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME, SPENT ON HER SIDE
IN INFERIOR SOCIETY AND MORE FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS,
HAD PERHAPS ROBBED HER OF THAT SIMPLICITY WHICH MIGHT
ONCE HAVE GIVEN AN INTERESTING CHARACTER TO HER BEAUTY.

IF IN THE SUPPOSITION OF HIS SEEKING TO MARRY HERSELF,
HIS DIFFICULTIES FROM HIS MOTHER HAD SEEMED GREAT,
HOW MUCH GREATER WERE THEY NOW LIKELY TO BE, WHEN
THE OBJECT OF HIS ENGAGEMENT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY INFERIOR
IN CONNECTIONS, AND PROBABLY INFERIOR IN FORTUNE TO HERSELF.
THESE DIFFICULTIES, INDEED, WITH A HEART SO ALIENATED
FROM LUCY, MIGHT NOT PRESS VERY HARD UPON HIS PATIENCE;
BUT MELANCHOLY WAS THE STATE OF THE PERSON BY WHOM THE
EXPECTATION OF FAMILY OPPOSITION AND UNKINDNESS, COULD
BE FELT AS A RELIEF!

AS THESE CONSIDERATIONS OCCURRED TO HER IN PAINFUL
SUCCESSION, SHE WEPT FOR HIM, MORE THAN FOR HERSELF.
SUPPORTED BY THE CONVICTION OF HAVING DONE NOTHING TO
MERIT HER PRESENT UNHAPPINESS, AND CONSOLED BY THE BELIEF
THAT EDWARD HAD DONE NOTHING TO FORFEIT HER ESTEEM,
SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD EVEN NOW, UNDER THE FIRST SMART
OF THE HEAVY BLOW, COMMAND HERSELF ENOUGH TO GUARD EVERY
SUSPICION OF THE TRUTH FROM HER MOTHER AND SISTERS.
AND SO WELL WAS SHE ABLE TO ANSWER HER OWN EXPECTATIONS,
THAT WHEN SHE JOINED THEM AT DINNER ONLY TWO HOURS
AFTER SHE HAD FIRST SUFFERED THE EXTINCTION OF ALL HER
DEAREST HOPES, NO ONE WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED FROM THE
APPEARANCE OF THE SISTERS, THAT ELINOR WAS MOURNING
IN SECRET OVER OBSTACLES WHICH MUST DIVIDE HER FOR EVER
FROM THE OBJECT OF HER LOVE, AND THAT MARIANNE WAS
INTERNALLY DWELLING ON THE PERFECTIONS OF A MAN, OF WHOSE
WHOLE HEART SHE FELT THOROUGHLY POSSESSED, AND WHOM SHE
EXPECTED TO SEE IN EVERY CARRIAGE WHICH DROVE NEAR THEIR HOUSE.

THE NECESSITY OF CONCEALING FROM HER MOTHER AND
MARIANNE, WHAT HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED IN CONFIDENCE TO HERSELF,
THOUGH IT OBLIGED HER TO UNCEASING EXERTION, WAS NO
AGGRAVATION OF ELINOR'S DISTRESS.  ON THE CONTRARY
IT WAS A RELIEF TO HER, TO BE SPARED THE COMMUNICATION
OF WHAT WOULD GIVE SUCH AFFLICTION TO THEM, AND TO BE
SAVED LIKEWISE FROM HEARING THAT CONDEMNATION OF EDWARD,
WHICH WOULD PROBABLY FLOW FROM THE EXCESS OF THEIR PARTIAL
AFFECTION FOR HERSELF, AND WHICH WAS MORE THAN SHE FELT
EQUAL TO SUPPORT.

FROM THEIR COUNSEL, OR THEIR CONVERSATION, SHE KNEW
SHE COULD RECEIVE NO ASSISTANCE, THEIR TENDERNESS AND
SORROW MUST ADD TO HER DISTRESS, WHILE HER SELF-COMMAND
WOULD NEITHER RECEIVE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THEIR EXAMPLE
NOR FROM THEIR PRAISE.  SHE WAS STRONGER ALONE,
AND HER OWN GOOD SENSE SO WELL SUPPORTED HER, THAT HER
FIRMNESS WAS AS UNSHAKEN, HER APPEARANCE OF CHEERFULNESS
AS INVARIABLE, AS WITH REGRETS SO POIGNANT AND SO FRESH,
IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BE.

MUCH AS SHE HAD SUFFERED FROM HER FIRST CONVERSATION
WITH LUCY ON THE SUBJECT, SHE SOON FELT AN EARNEST WISH
OF RENEWING IT; AND THIS FOR MORE REASONS THAN ONE.
SHE WANTED TO HEAR MANY PARTICULARS OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT
REPEATED AGAIN, SHE WANTED MORE CLEARLY TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT LUCY REALLY FELT FOR EDWARD, WHETHER THERE WERE ANY
SINCERITY IN HER DECLARATION OF TENDER REGARD FOR HIM,
AND SHE PARTICULARLY WANTED TO CONVINCE LUCY, BY HER
READINESS TO ENTER ON THE MATTER AGAIN, AND HER CALMNESS
IN CONVERSING ON IT, THAT SHE WAS NO OTHERWISE INTERESTED
IN IT THAN AS A FRIEND, WHICH SHE VERY MUCH FEARED
HER INVOLUNTARY AGITATION, IN THEIR MORNING DISCOURSE,
MUST HAVE LEFT AT LEAST DOUBTFUL.  THAT LUCY WAS DISPOSED
TO BE JEALOUS OF HER APPEARED VERY PROBABLE: IT WAS PLAIN
THAT EDWARD HAD ALWAYS SPOKEN HIGHLY IN HER PRAISE,
NOT MERELY FROM LUCY'S ASSERTION, BUT FROM HER VENTURING
TO TRUST HER ON SO SHORT A PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE,
WITH A SECRET SO CONFESSEDLY AND EVIDENTLY IMPORTANT.
AND EVEN SIR JOHN'S JOKING INTELLIGENCE MUST HAVE HAD
SOME WEIGHT.  BUT INDEED, WHILE ELINOR REMAINED SO WELL
ASSURED WITHIN HERSELF OF BEING REALLY BELOVED BY EDWARD,
IT REQUIRED NO OTHER CONSIDERATION OF PROBABILITIES
TO MAKE IT NATURAL THAT LUCY SHOULD BE JEALOUS;
AND THAT SHE WAS SO, HER VERY CONFIDENCE WAS A PROOF.
WHAT OTHER REASON FOR THE DISCLOSURE OF THE AFFAIR COULD
THERE BE, BUT THAT ELINOR MIGHT BE INFORMED BY IT OF LUCY'S
SUPERIOR CLAIMS ON EDWARD, AND BE TAUGHT TO AVOID HIM
IN FUTURE?  SHE HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THUS
MUCH OF HER RIVAL'S INTENTIONS, AND WHILE SHE WAS FIRMLY
RESOLVED TO ACT BY HER AS EVERY PRINCIPLE OF HONOUR AND
HONESTY DIRECTED, TO COMBAT HER OWN AFFECTION FOR EDWARD
AND TO SEE HIM AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE; SHE COULD NOT DENY
HERSELF THE COMFORT OF ENDEAVOURING TO CONVINCE LUCY
THAT HER HEART WAS UNWOUNDED.  AND AS SHE COULD NOW HAVE
NOTHING MORE PAINFUL TO HEAR ON THE SUBJECT THAN HAD ALREADY
BEEN TOLD, SHE DID NOT MISTRUST HER OWN ABILITY OF GOING
THROUGH A REPETITION OF PARTICULARS WITH COMPOSURE.

BUT IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY THAT AN OPPORTUNITY
OF DOING SO COULD BE COMMANDED, THOUGH LUCY WAS AS WELL
DISPOSED AS HERSELF TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY THAT OCCURRED;
FOR THE WEATHER WAS NOT OFTEN FINE ENOUGH TO ALLOW
OF THEIR JOINING IN A WALK, WHERE THEY MIGHT MOST EASILY
SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE OTHERS; AND THOUGH THEY
MET AT LEAST EVERY OTHER EVENING EITHER AT THE PARK
OR COTTAGE, AND CHIEFLY AT THE FORMER, THEY COULD
NOT BE SUPPOSED TO MEET FOR THE SAKE OF CONVERSATION.
SUCH A THOUGHT WOULD NEVER ENTER EITHER SIR JOHN OR LADY
MIDDLETON'S HEAD; AND THEREFORE VERY LITTLE LEISURE
WAS EVER GIVEN FOR A GENERAL CHAT, AND NONE AT ALL FOR
PARTICULAR DISCOURSE.  THEY MET FOR THE SAKE OF EATING,
DRINKING, AND LAUGHING TOGETHER, PLAYING AT CARDS,
OR CONSEQUENCES, OR ANY OTHER GAME THAT WAS SUFFICIENTLY NOISY.

ONE OR TWO MEETINGS OF THIS KIND HAD TAKEN PLACE,
WITHOUT AFFORDING ELINOR ANY CHANCE OF ENGAGING LUCY
IN PRIVATE, WHEN SIR JOHN CALLED AT THE COTTAGE ONE MORNING,
TO BEG, IN THE NAME OF CHARITY, THAT THEY WOULD ALL
DINE WITH LADY MIDDLETON THAT DAY, AS HE WAS OBLIGED
TO ATTEND THE CLUB AT EXETER, AND SHE WOULD OTHERWISE BE
QUITE ALONE, EXCEPT HER MOTHER AND THE TWO MISS STEELES.
ELINOR, WHO FORESAW A FAIRER OPENING FOR THE POINT SHE
HAD IN VIEW, IN SUCH A PARTY AS THIS WAS LIKELY TO BE,
MORE AT LIBERTY AMONG THEMSELVES UNDER THE TRANQUIL
AND WELL-BRED DIRECTION OF LADY MIDDLETON THAN WHEN
HER HUSBAND UNITED THEM TOGETHER IN ONE NOISY PURPOSE,
IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION; MARGARET, WITH HER
MOTHER'S PERMISSION, WAS EQUALLY COMPLIANT, AND MARIANNE,
THOUGH ALWAYS UNWILLING TO JOIN ANY OF THEIR PARTIES,
WAS PERSUADED BY HER MOTHER, WHO COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HER
SECLUDE HERSELF FROM ANY CHANCE OF AMUSEMENT, TO GO LIKEWISE.

THE YOUNG LADIES WENT, AND LADY MIDDLETON WAS HAPPILY
PRESERVED FROM THE FRIGHTFUL SOLITUDE WHICH HAD THREATENED HER.
THE INSIPIDITY OF THE MEETING WAS EXACTLY SUCH AS ELINOR
HAD EXPECTED; IT PRODUCED NOT ONE NOVELTY OF THOUGHT
OR EXPRESSION, AND NOTHING COULD BE LESS INTERESTING
THAN THE WHOLE OF THEIR DISCOURSE BOTH IN THE DINING
PARLOUR AND DRAWING ROOM: TO THE LATTER, THE CHILDREN
ACCOMPANIED THEM, AND WHILE THEY REMAINED THERE, SHE WAS
TOO WELL CONVINCED OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ENGAGING LUCY'S
ATTENTION TO ATTEMPT IT.  THEY QUITTED IT ONLY WITH THE
REMOVAL OF THE TEA-THINGS.  THE CARD-TABLE WAS THEN PLACED,
AND ELINOR BEGAN TO WONDER AT HERSELF FOR HAVING EVER
ENTERTAINED A HOPE OF FINDING TIME FOR CONVERSATION
AT THE PARK.  THEY ALL ROSE UP IN PREPARATION FOR A ROUND GAME.

"I AM GLAD," SAID LADY MIDDLETON TO LUCY,
"YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FINISH POOR LITTLE ANNAMARIA'S
BASKET THIS EVENING; FOR I AM SURE IT MUST HURT YOUR
EYES TO WORK FILIGREE BY CANDLELIGHT.  AND WE WILL MAKE
THE DEAR LITTLE LOVE SOME AMENDS FOR HER DISAPPOINTMENT
TO-MORROW, AND THEN I HOPE SHE WILL NOT MUCH MIND IT."

THIS HINT WAS ENOUGH, LUCY RECOLLECTED HERSELF INSTANTLY
AND REPLIED, "INDEED YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN,
LADY MIDDLETON; I AM ONLY WAITING TO KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN
MAKE YOUR PARTY WITHOUT ME, OR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT MY
FILIGREE ALREADY.  I WOULD NOT DISAPPOINT THE LITTLE ANGEL
FOR ALL THE WORLD: AND IF YOU WANT ME AT THE CARD-TABLE NOW,
I AM RESOLVED TO FINISH THE BASKET AFTER SUPPER."

"YOU ARE VERY GOOD, I HOPE IT WON'T HURT YOUR EYES--
WILL YOU RING THE BELL FOR SOME WORKING CANDLES?
MY POOR LITTLE GIRL WOULD BE SADLY DISAPPOINTED, I KNOW,
IF THE BASKET WAS NOT FINISHED TOMORROW, FOR THOUGH I
TOLD HER IT CERTAINLY WOULD NOT, I AM SURE SHE DEPENDS
UPON HAVING IT DONE."

LUCY DIRECTLY DREW HER WORK TABLE NEAR HER
AND RESEATED HERSELF WITH AN ALACRITY AND CHEERFULNESS
WHICH SEEMED TO INFER THAT SHE COULD TASTE NO GREATER
DELIGHT THAN IN MAKING A FILIGREE BASKET FOR A SPOILT CHILD.

LADY MIDDLETON PROPOSED A RUBBER OF CASINO TO THE OTHERS.
NO ONE MADE ANY OBJECTION BUT MARIANNE, WHO WITH HER USUAL
INATTENTION TO THE FORMS OF GENERAL CIVILITY, EXCLAIMED,
"YOUR LADYSHIP WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO EXCUSE ME--YOU
KNOW I DETEST CARDS.  I SHALL GO TO THE PIANO-FORTE;
I HAVE NOT TOUCHED IT SINCE IT WAS TUNED."  AND WITHOUT
FARTHER CEREMONY, SHE TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO THE INSTRUMENT.

LADY MIDDLETON LOOKED AS IF SHE THANKED HEAVEN
THAT SHE HAD NEVER MADE SO RUDE A SPEECH.

"MARIANNE CAN NEVER KEEP LONG FROM THAT INSTRUMENT
YOU KNOW, MA'AM," SAID ELINOR, ENDEAVOURING TO SMOOTH
AWAY THE OFFENCE; "AND I DO NOT MUCH WONDER AT IT; FOR IT
IS THE VERY BEST TONED PIANO-FORTE I EVER HEARD."

THE REMAINING FIVE WERE NOW TO DRAW THEIR CARDS.

"PERHAPS," CONTINUED ELINOR, "IF I SHOULD HAPPEN
TO CUT OUT, I MAY BE OF SOME USE TO MISS LUCY STEELE,
IN ROLLING HER PAPERS FOR HER; AND THERE IS SO MUCH STILL
TO BE DONE TO THE BASKET, THAT IT MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE
I THINK FOR HER LABOUR SINGLY, TO FINISH IT THIS EVENING.
I SHOULD LIKE THE WORK EXCEEDINGLY, IF SHE WOULD ALLOW
ME A SHARE IN IT."

"INDEED I SHALL BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
FOR YOUR HELP," CRIED LUCY, "FOR I FIND THERE IS MORE
TO BE DONE TO IT THAN I THOUGHT THERE WAS; AND IT WOULD
BE A SHOCKING THING TO DISAPPOINT DEAR ANNAMARIA AFTER ALL."

"OH! THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE, INDEED," SAID MISS STEELE--
"DEAR LITTLE SOUL, HOW I DO LOVE HER!"

"YOU ARE VERY KIND," SAID LADY MIDDLETON TO ELINOR;
"AND AS YOU REALLY LIKE THE WORK, PERHAPS YOU WILL BE
AS WELL PLEASED NOT TO CUT IN TILL ANOTHER RUBBER,
OR WILL YOU TAKE YOUR CHANCE NOW?"

ELINOR JOYFULLY PROFITED BY THE FIRST OF THESE PROPOSALS,
AND THUS BY A LITTLE OF THAT ADDRESS WHICH MARIANNE
COULD NEVER CONDESCEND TO PRACTISE, GAINED HER OWN END,
AND PLEASED LADY MIDDLETON AT THE SAME TIME.  LUCY MADE ROOM
FOR HER WITH READY ATTENTION, AND THE TWO FAIR RIVALS WERE
THUS SEATED SIDE BY SIDE AT THE SAME TABLE, AND, WITH THE
UTMOST HARMONY, ENGAGED IN FORWARDING THE SAME WORK.
THE PIANOFORTE AT WHICH MARIANNE, WRAPPED UP IN HER OWN
MUSIC AND HER OWN THOUGHTS, HAD BY THIS TIME FORGOTTEN
THAT ANY BODY WAS IN THE ROOM BESIDES HERSELF, WAS LUCKILY
SO NEAR THEM THAT MISS DASHWOOD NOW JUDGED SHE MIGHT SAFELY,
UNDER THE SHELTER OF ITS NOISE, INTRODUCE THE INTERESTING
SUBJECT, WITHOUT ANY RISK OF BEING HEARD AT THE CARD-TABLE.



CHAPTER 24


IN A FIRM, THOUGH CAUTIOUS TONE, ELINOR THUS BEGAN.

"I SHOULD BE UNDESERVING OF THE CONFIDENCE YOU HAVE
HONOURED ME WITH, IF I FELT NO DESIRE FOR ITS CONTINUANCE,
OR NO FARTHER CURIOSITY ON ITS SUBJECT.  I WILL
NOT APOLOGIZE THEREFORE FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AGAIN."

"THANK YOU," CRIED LUCY WARMLY, "FOR BREAKING
THE ICE; YOU HAVE SET MY HEART AT EASE BY IT; FOR I WAS
SOMEHOW OR OTHER AFRAID I HAD OFFENDED YOU BY WHAT I
TOLD YOU THAT MONDAY."

"OFFENDED ME! HOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE SO? BELIEVE ME,"
AND ELINOR SPOKE IT WITH THE TRUEST SINCERITY,
"NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM MY INTENTION THAN TO GIVE
YOU SUCH AN IDEA.  COULD YOU HAVE A MOTIVE FOR THE TRUST,
THAT WAS NOT HONOURABLE AND FLATTERING TO ME?"

"AND YET I DO ASSURE YOU," REPLIED LUCY, HER LITTLE
SHARP EYES FULL OF MEANING, "THERE SEEMED TO ME TO BE
A COLDNESS AND DISPLEASURE IN YOUR MANNER THAT MADE ME
QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE.  I FELT SURE THAT YOU WAS ANGRY WITH ME;
AND HAVE BEEN QUARRELLING WITH MYSELF EVER SINCE, FOR HAVING
TOOK SUCH A LIBERTY AS TO TROUBLE YOU WITH MY AFFAIRS.
BUT I AM VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS ONLY MY OWN FANCY,
AND THAT YOU REALLY DO NOT BLAME ME.  IF YOU KNEW WHAT A
CONSOLATION IT WAS TO ME TO RELIEVE MY HEART SPEAKING TO YOU
OF WHAT I AM ALWAYS THINKING OF EVERY MOMENT OF MY LIFE,
YOUR COMPASSION WOULD MAKE YOU OVERLOOK EVERY THING ELSE
I AM SURE."

"INDEED, I CAN EASILY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A VERY GREAT
RELIEF TO YOU, TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR SITUATION TO ME, AND BE
ASSURED THAT YOU SHALL NEVER HAVE REASON TO REPENT IT.
YOUR CASE IS A VERY UNFORTUNATE ONE; YOU SEEM TO ME TO
BE SURROUNDED WITH DIFFICULTIES, AND YOU WILL HAVE NEED
OF ALL YOUR MUTUAL AFFECTION TO SUPPORT YOU UNDER THEM.
MR. FERRARS, I BELIEVE, IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON HIS MOTHER."

"HE HAS ONLY TWO THOUSAND POUNDS OF HIS OWN; IT WOULD
BE MADNESS TO MARRY UPON THAT, THOUGH FOR MY OWN PART,
I COULD GIVE UP EVERY PROSPECT OF MORE WITHOUT A SIGH.
I HAVE BEEN ALWAYS USED TO A VERY SMALL INCOME, AND COULD
STRUGGLE WITH ANY POVERTY FOR HIM; BUT I LOVE HIM TOO WELL
TO BE THE SELFISH MEANS OF ROBBING HIM, PERHAPS, OF ALL THAT
HIS MOTHER MIGHT GIVE HIM IF HE MARRIED TO PLEASE HER.
WE MUST WAIT, IT MAY BE FOR MANY YEARS.  WITH ALMOST EVERY
OTHER MAN IN THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE AN ALARMING PROSPECT;
BUT EDWARD'S AFFECTION AND CONSTANCY NOTHING CAN DEPRIVE ME OF
I KNOW."

"THAT CONVICTION MUST BE EVERY THING TO YOU;
AND HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORTED BY THE SAME TRUST IN YOUR'S.
IF THE STRENGTH OF YOUR RECIPROCAL ATTACHMENT HAD FAILED,
AS BETWEEN MANY PEOPLE, AND UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES
IT NATURALLY WOULD DURING A FOUR YEARS' ENGAGEMENT,
YOUR SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN PITIABLE, INDEED."

LUCY HERE LOOKED UP; BUT ELINOR WAS CAREFUL
IN GUARDING HER COUNTENANCE FROM EVERY EXPRESSION
THAT COULD GIVE HER WORDS A SUSPICIOUS TENDENCY.

"EDWARD'S LOVE FOR ME," SAID LUCY, "HAS BEEN PRETTY
WELL PUT TO THE TEST, BY OUR LONG, VERY LONG ABSENCE
SINCE WE WERE FIRST ENGAGED, AND IT HAS STOOD THE TRIAL
SO WELL, THAT I SHOULD BE UNPARDONABLE TO DOUBT IT NOW.
I CAN SAFELY SAY THAT HE HAS NEVER GAVE ME ONE MOMENT'S
ALARM ON THAT ACCOUNT FROM THE FIRST."

ELINOR HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO SMILE OR SIGH
AT THIS ASSERTION.

LUCY WENT ON.  "I AM RATHER OF A JEALOUS TEMPER TOO
BY NATURE, AND FROM OUR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN LIFE,
FROM HIS BEING SO MUCH MORE IN THE WORLD THAN ME, AND OUR
CONTINUAL SEPARATION, I WAS ENOUGH INCLINED FOR SUSPICION,
TO HAVE FOUND OUT THE TRUTH IN AN INSTANT, IF THERE HAD BEEN
THE SLIGHTEST ALTERATION IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME WHEN WE MET,
OR ANY LOWNESS OF SPIRITS THAT I COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR,
OR IF HE HAD TALKED MORE OF ONE LADY THAN ANOTHER,
OR SEEMED IN ANY RESPECT LESS HAPPY AT LONGSTAPLE THAN HE
USED TO BE.  I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT I AM PARTICULARLY
OBSERVANT OR QUICK-SIGHTED IN GENERAL, BUT IN SUCH A CASE
I AM SURE I COULD NOT BE DECEIVED."

"ALL THIS," THOUGHT ELINOR, "IS VERY PRETTY;
BUT IT CAN IMPOSE UPON NEITHER OF US."

"BUT WHAT," SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT SILENCE,
"ARE YOUR VIEWS? OR HAVE YOU NONE BUT THAT OF WAITING FOR
MRS. FERRARS'S DEATH, WHICH IS A MELANCHOLY AND SHOCKING
EXTREMITY?--IS HER SON DETERMINED TO SUBMIT TO THIS,
AND TO ALL THE TEDIOUSNESS OF THE MANY YEARS OF SUSPENSE
IN WHICH IT MAY INVOLVE YOU, RATHER THAN RUN THE RISK
OF HER DISPLEASURE FOR A WHILE BY OWNING THE TRUTH?"

"IF WE COULD BE CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD BE ONLY
FOR A WHILE!  BUT MRS. FERRARS IS A VERY HEADSTRONG
PROUD WOMAN, AND IN HER FIRST FIT OF ANGER UPON HEARING
IT, WOULD VERY LIKELY SECURE EVERY THING TO ROBERT,
AND THE IDEA OF THAT, FOR EDWARD'S SAKE, FRIGHTENS AWAY
ALL MY INCLINATION FOR HASTY MEASURES."

"AND FOR YOUR OWN SAKE TOO, OR YOU ARE CARRYING
YOUR DISINTERESTEDNESS BEYOND REASON."

LUCY LOOKED AT ELINOR AGAIN, AND WAS SILENT.

"DO YOU KNOW MR. ROBERT FERRARS?" ASKED ELINOR.

"NOT AT ALL--I NEVER SAW HIM; BUT I FANCY HE
IS VERY UNLIKE HIS BROTHER--SILLY AND A GREAT COXCOMB."

"A GREAT COXCOMB!" REPEATED MISS STEELE, WHOSE EAR HAD
CAUGHT THOSE WORDS BY A SUDDEN PAUSE IN MARIANNE'S MUSIC.--
"OH, THEY ARE TALKING OF THEIR FAVOURITE BEAUX, I DARE SAY."

"NO SISTER," CRIED LUCY, "YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE, OUR
FAVOURITE BEAUX ARE NOT GREAT COXCOMBS."

"I CAN ANSWER FOR IT THAT MISS DASHWOOD'S IS NOT,"
SAID MRS. JENNINGS, LAUGHING HEARTILY; "FOR HE IS ONE
OF THE MODESTEST, PRETTIEST BEHAVED YOUNG MEN I EVER SAW;
BUT AS FOR LUCY, SHE IS SUCH A SLY LITTLE CREATURE,
THERE IS NO FINDING OUT WHO SHE LIKES."

"OH," CRIED MISS STEELE, LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY ROUND
AT THEM, "I DARE SAY LUCY'S BEAU IS QUITE AS MODEST
AND PRETTY BEHAVED AS MISS DASHWOOD'S."

ELINOR BLUSHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF.  LUCY BIT HER LIP,
AND LOOKED ANGRILY AT HER SISTER.  A MUTUAL SILENCE TOOK
PLACE FOR SOME TIME.  LUCY FIRST PUT AN END TO IT BY SAYING
IN A LOWER TONE, THOUGH MARIANNE WAS THEN GIVING THEM
THE POWERFUL PROTECTION OF A VERY MAGNIFICENT CONCERTO--

"I WILL HONESTLY TELL YOU OF ONE SCHEME WHICH HAS
LATELY COME INTO MY HEAD, FOR BRINGING MATTERS TO BEAR;
INDEED I AM BOUND TO LET YOU INTO THE SECRET, FOR YOU
ARE A PARTY CONCERNED.  I DARE SAY YOU HAVE SEEN ENOUGH
OF EDWARD TO KNOW THAT HE WOULD PREFER THE CHURCH TO EVERY
OTHER PROFESSION; NOW MY PLAN IS THAT HE SHOULD TAKE
ORDERS AS SOON AS HE CAN, AND THEN THROUGH YOUR INTEREST,
WHICH I AM SURE YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO USE OUT OF
FRIENDSHIP FOR HIM, AND I HOPE OUT OF SOME REGARD TO ME,
YOUR BROTHER MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO GIVE HIM NORLAND LIVING;
WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A VERY GOOD ONE, AND THE PRESENT
INCUMBENT NOT LIKELY TO LIVE A GREAT WHILE.  THAT WOULD
BE ENOUGH FOR US TO MARRY UPON, AND WE MIGHT TRUST TO TIME
AND CHANCE FOR THE REST."

"I SHOULD ALWAYS BE HAPPY," REPLIED ELINOR, "TO SHOW
ANY MARK OF MY ESTEEM AND FRIENDSHIP FOR MR. FERRARS;
BUT DO YOU NOT PERCEIVE THAT MY INTEREST ON SUCH AN
OCCASION WOULD BE PERFECTLY UNNECESSARY?  HE IS BROTHER
TO MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD--THAT MUST BE RECOMMENDATION ENOUGH
TO HER HUSBAND."

"BUT MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD WOULD NOT MUCH APPROVE
OF EDWARD'S GOING INTO ORDERS."

"THEN I RATHER SUSPECT THAT MY INTEREST WOULD
DO VERY LITTLE."

THEY WERE AGAIN SILENT FOR MANY MINUTES.  AT LENGTH
LUCY EXCLAIMED WITH A DEEP SIGH,

"I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE THE WISEST WAY TO PUT AN END
TO THE BUSINESS AT ONCE BY DISSOLVING THE ENGAGEMENT.
WE SEEM SO BESET WITH DIFFICULTIES ON EVERY SIDE,
THAT THOUGH IT WOULD MAKE US MISERABLE FOR A TIME,
WE SHOULD BE HAPPIER PERHAPS IN THE END.  BUT YOU WILL
NOT GIVE ME YOUR ADVICE, MISS DASHWOOD?"

"NO," ANSWERED ELINOR, WITH A SMILE, WHICH CONCEALED
VERY AGITATED FEELINGS, "ON SUCH A SUBJECT I CERTAINLY
WILL NOT.  YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT MY OPINION WOULD HAVE
NO WEIGHT WITH YOU, UNLESS IT WERE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR WISHES."

"INDEED YOU WRONG ME," REPLIED LUCY, WITH GREAT
SOLEMNITY; "I KNOW NOBODY OF WHOSE JUDGMENT I THINK
SO HIGHLY AS I DO OF YOURS; AND I DO REALLY BELIEVE,
THAT IF YOU WAS TO SAY TO ME, 'I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS
TO PUT AN END TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH EDWARD FERRARS,
IT WILL BE MORE FOR THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH OF YOU,'
I SHOULD RESOLVE UPON DOING IT IMMEDIATELY."

ELINOR BLUSHED FOR THE INSINCERITY OF EDWARD'S
FUTURE WIFE, AND REPLIED, "THIS COMPLIMENT WOULD EFFECTUALLY
FRIGHTEN ME FROM GIVING ANY OPINION ON THE SUBJECT
HAD I FORMED ONE.  IT RAISES MY INFLUENCE MUCH TOO HIGH;
THE POWER OF DIVIDING TWO PEOPLE SO TENDERLY ATTACHED
IS TOO MUCH FOR AN INDIFFERENT PERSON."

"'TIS BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INDIFFERENT PERSON," SAID LUCY,
WITH SOME PIQUE, AND LAYING A PARTICULAR STRESS ON THOSE WORDS,
"THAT YOUR JUDGMENT MIGHT JUSTLY HAVE SUCH WEIGHT WITH ME.
IF YOU COULD BE SUPPOSED TO BE BIASED IN ANY RESPECT
BY YOUR OWN FEELINGS, YOUR OPINION WOULD NOT BE WORTH HAVING."

ELINOR THOUGHT IT WISEST TO MAKE NO ANSWER TO THIS,
LEST THEY MIGHT PROVOKE EACH OTHER TO AN UNSUITABLE INCREASE
OF EASE AND UNRESERVE; AND WAS EVEN PARTLY DETERMINED
NEVER TO MENTION THE SUBJECT AGAIN.  ANOTHER PAUSE
THEREFORE OF MANY MINUTES' DURATION, SUCCEEDED THIS SPEECH,
AND LUCY WAS STILL THE FIRST TO END IT.

"SHALL YOU BE IN TOWN THIS WINTER, MISS DASHWOOD?"
SAID SHE WITH ALL HER ACCUSTOMARY COMPLACENCY.

"CERTAINLY NOT."

"I AM SORRY FOR THAT," RETURNED THE OTHER,
WHILE HER EYES BRIGHTENED AT THE INFORMATION,
"IT WOULD HAVE GAVE ME SUCH PLEASURE TO MEET YOU THERE!
BUT I DARE SAY YOU WILL GO FOR ALL THAT.  TO BE SURE,
YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER WILL ASK YOU TO COME TO THEM."

"IT WILL NOT BE IN MY POWER TO ACCEPT THEIR INVITATION
IF THEY DO."

"HOW UNLUCKY THAT IS! I HAD QUITE DEPENDED UPON
MEETING YOU THERE.  ANNE AND ME ARE TO GO THE LATTER END
OF JANUARY TO SOME RELATIONS WHO HAVE BEEN WANTING US TO
VISIT THEM THESE SEVERAL YEARS!  BUT I ONLY GO FOR THE SAKE
OF SEEING EDWARD.  HE WILL BE THERE IN FEBRUARY, OTHERWISE
LONDON WOULD HAVE NO CHARMS FOR ME; I HAVE NOT SPIRITS FOR IT."

ELINOR WAS SOON CALLED TO THE CARD-TABLE BY THE
CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST RUBBER, AND THE CONFIDENTIAL
DISCOURSE OF THE TWO LADIES WAS THEREFORE AT AN END,
TO WHICH BOTH OF THEM SUBMITTED WITHOUT ANY RELUCTANCE,
FOR NOTHING HAD BEEN SAID ON EITHER SIDE TO MAKE THEM
DISLIKE EACH OTHER LESS THAN THEY HAD DONE BEFORE;
AND ELINOR SAT DOWN TO THE CARD TABLE WITH THE MELANCHOLY
PERSUASION THAT EDWARD WAS NOT ONLY WITHOUT AFFECTION
FOR THE PERSON WHO WAS TO BE HIS WIFE; BUT THAT HE HAD
NOT EVEN THE CHANCE OF BEING TOLERABLY HAPPY IN MARRIAGE,
WHICH SINCERE AFFECTION ON HER SIDE WOULD HAVE GIVEN,
FOR SELF-INTEREST ALONE COULD INDUCE A WOMAN TO KEEP A MAN
TO AN ENGAGEMENT, OF WHICH SHE SEEMED SO THOROUGHLY AWARE
THAT HE WAS WEARY.

FROM THIS TIME THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER REVIVED BY ELINOR,
AND WHEN ENTERED ON BY LUCY, WHO SELDOM MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY
OF INTRODUCING IT, AND WAS PARTICULARLY CAREFUL TO INFORM
HER CONFIDANTE, OF HER HAPPINESS WHENEVER SHE RECEIVED A LETTER
FROM EDWARD, IT WAS TREATED BY THE FORMER WITH CALMNESS
AND CAUTION, AND DISMISSED AS SOON AS CIVILITY WOULD ALLOW;
FOR SHE FELT SUCH CONVERSATIONS TO BE AN INDULGENCE WHICH
LUCY DID NOT DESERVE, AND WHICH WERE DANGEROUS TO HERSELF.

THE VISIT OF THE MISS STEELES AT BARTON PARK WAS
LENGTHENED FAR BEYOND WHAT THE FIRST INVITATION IMPLIED.
THEIR FAVOUR INCREASED; THEY COULD NOT BE SPARED;
SIR JOHN WOULD NOT HEAR OF THEIR GOING; AND IN SPITE
OF THEIR NUMEROUS AND LONG ARRANGED ENGAGEMENTS IN EXETER,
IN SPITE OF THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF RETURNING TO FULFILL
THEM IMMEDIATELY, WHICH WAS IN FULL FORCE AT THE END
OF EVERY WEEK, THEY WERE PREVAILED ON TO STAY NEARLY TWO
MONTHS AT THE PARK, AND TO ASSIST IN THE DUE CELEBRATION
OF THAT FESTIVAL WHICH REQUIRES A MORE THAN ORDINARY
SHARE OF PRIVATE BALLS AND LARGE DINNERS TO PROCLAIM
ITS IMPORTANCE.



CHAPTER 25


THOUGH MRS. JENNINGS WAS IN THE HABIT OF SPENDING A LARGE
PORTION OF THE YEAR AT THE HOUSES OF HER CHILDREN AND FRIENDS,
SHE WAS NOT WITHOUT A SETTLED HABITATION OF HER OWN.
SINCE THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND, WHO HAD TRADED WITH SUCCESS
IN A LESS ELEGANT PART OF THE TOWN, SHE HAD RESIDED EVERY
WINTER IN A HOUSE IN ONE OF THE STREETS NEAR PORTMAN SQUARE.
TOWARDS THIS HOME, SHE BEGAN ON THE APPROACH OF JANUARY
TO TURN HER THOUGHTS, AND THITHER SHE ONE DAY ABRUPTLY,
AND VERY UNEXPECTEDLY BY THEM, ASKED THE ELDER MISSES
DASHWOOD TO ACCOMPANY HER.  ELINOR, WITHOUT OBSERVING
THE VARYING COMPLEXION OF HER SISTER, AND THE ANIMATED LOOK
WHICH SPOKE NO INDIFFERENCE TO THE PLAN, IMMEDIATELY GAVE
A GRATEFUL BUT ABSOLUTE DENIAL FOR BOTH, IN WHICH SHE
BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE SPEAKING THEIR UNITED INCLINATIONS.
THE REASON ALLEGED WAS THEIR DETERMINED RESOLUTION
OF NOT LEAVING THEIR MOTHER AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR.
MRS. JENNINGS RECEIVED THE REFUSAL WITH SOME SURPRISE,
AND REPEATED HER INVITATION IMMEDIATELY.

"OH, LORD! I AM SURE YOUR MOTHER CAN SPARE YOU
VERY WELL, AND I DO BEG YOU WILL FAVOUR ME WITH
YOUR COMPANY, FOR I'VE QUITE SET MY HEART UPON IT.
DON'T FANCY THAT YOU WILL BE ANY INCONVENIENCE TO ME,
FOR I SHAN'T PUT MYSELF AT ALL OUT OF MY WAY FOR YOU.
IT WILL ONLY BE SENDING BETTY BY THE COACH, AND I
HOPE I CAN AFFORD THAT.  WE THREE SHALL BE ABLE TO GO
VERY WELL IN MY CHAISE; AND WHEN WE ARE IN TOWN,
IF YOU DO NOT LIKE TO GO WHEREVER I DO, WELL AND GOOD,
YOU MAY ALWAYS GO WITH ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS.  I AM SURE
YOUR MOTHER WILL NOT OBJECT TO IT; FOR I HAVE HAD SUCH
GOOD LUCK IN GETTING MY OWN CHILDREN OFF MY HANDS THAT SHE
WILL THINK ME A VERY FIT PERSON TO HAVE THE CHARGE OF YOU;
AND IF I DON'T GET ONE OF YOU AT LEAST WELL MARRIED
BEFORE I HAVE DONE WITH YOU, IT SHALL NOT BE MY FAULT.
I SHALL SPEAK A GOOD WORD FOR YOU TO ALL THE YOUNG MEN,
YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT."

"I HAVE A NOTION," SAID SIR JOHN, "THAT MISS MARIANNE
WOULD NOT OBJECT TO SUCH A SCHEME, IF HER ELDER SISTER
WOULD COME INTO IT.  IT IS VERY HARD INDEED THAT SHE
SHOULD NOT HAVE A LITTLE PLEASURE, BECAUSE MISS DASHWOOD
DOES NOT WISH IT.  SO I WOULD ADVISE YOU TWO, TO SET OFF
FOR TOWN, WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF BARTON, WITHOUT SAYING
A WORD TO MISS DASHWOOD ABOUT IT."

"NAY," CRIED MRS. JENNINGS, "I AM SURE I SHALL BE
MONSTROUS GLAD OF MISS MARIANNE'S COMPANY, WHETHER MISS
DASHWOOD WILL GO OR NOT, ONLY THE MORE THE MERRIER SAY I,
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE FOR THEM TO
BE TOGETHER; BECAUSE, IF THEY GOT TIRED OF ME, THEY MIGHT TALK
TO ONE ANOTHER, AND LAUGH AT MY OLD WAYS BEHIND MY BACK.
BUT ONE OR THE OTHER, IF NOT BOTH OF THEM, I MUST HAVE.
LORD BLESS ME! HOW DO YOU THINK I CAN LIVE POKING BY MYSELF,
I WHO HAVE BEEN ALWAYS USED TILL THIS WINTER TO HAVE
CHARLOTTE WITH ME.  COME, MISS MARIANNE, LET US STRIKE
HANDS UPON THE BARGAIN, AND IF MISS DASHWOOD WILL CHANGE
HER MIND BY AND BYE, WHY SO MUCH THE BETTER."

"I THANK YOU, MA'AM, SINCERELY THANK YOU," SAID MARIANNE,
WITH WARMTH: "YOUR INVITATION HAS INSURED MY GRATITUDE FOR EVER,
AND IT WOULD GIVE ME SUCH HAPPINESS, YES, ALMOST THE GREATEST
HAPPINESS I AM CAPABLE OF, TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT IT.
BUT MY MOTHER, MY DEAREST, KINDEST MOTHER,--I FEEL THE
JUSTICE OF WHAT ELINOR HAS URGED, AND IF SHE WERE TO BE
MADE LESS HAPPY, LESS COMFORTABLE BY OUR ABSENCE--OH! NO,
NOTHING SHOULD TEMPT ME TO LEAVE HER.  IT SHOULD NOT,
MUST NOT BE A STRUGGLE."

MRS. JENNINGS REPEATED HER ASSURANCE THAT MRS. DASHWOOD
COULD SPARE THEM PERFECTLY WELL; AND ELINOR, WHO NOW
UNDERSTOOD HER SISTER, AND SAW TO WHAT INDIFFERENCE TO
ALMOST EVERY THING ELSE SHE WAS CARRIED BY HER EAGERNESS
TO BE WITH WILLOUGHBY AGAIN, MADE NO FARTHER DIRECT
OPPOSITION TO THE PLAN, AND MERELY REFERRED IT TO HER
MOTHER'S DECISION, FROM WHOM HOWEVER SHE SCARCELY EXPECTED
TO RECEIVE ANY SUPPORT IN HER ENDEAVOUR TO PREVENT A VISIT,
WHICH SHE COULD NOT APPROVE OF FOR MARIANNE, AND WHICH
ON HER OWN ACCOUNT SHE HAD PARTICULAR REASONS TO AVOID.
WHATEVER MARIANNE WAS DESIROUS OF, HER MOTHER WOULD BE EAGER
TO PROMOTE--SHE COULD NOT EXPECT TO INFLUENCE THE LATTER
TO CAUTIOUSNESS OF CONDUCT IN AN AFFAIR RESPECTING WHICH SHE
HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO INSPIRE HER WITH DISTRUST; AND SHE
DARED NOT EXPLAIN THE MOTIVE OF HER OWN DISINCLINATION
FOR GOING TO LONDON.  THAT MARIANNE, FASTIDIOUS AS SHE WAS,
THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH MRS. JENNINGS' MANNERS,
AND INVARIABLY DISGUSTED BY THEM, SHOULD OVERLOOK EVERY
INCONVENIENCE OF THAT KIND, SHOULD DISREGARD WHATEVER
MUST BE MOST WOUNDING TO HER IRRITABLE FEELINGS, IN HER
PURSUIT OF ONE OBJECT, WAS SUCH A PROOF, SO STRONG,
SO FULL, OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT OBJECT TO HER, AS ELINOR,
IN SPITE OF ALL THAT HAD PASSED, WAS NOT PREPARED TO WITNESS.

ON BEING INFORMED OF THE INVITATION, MRS. DASHWOOD,
PERSUADED THAT SUCH AN EXCURSION WOULD BE PRODUCTIVE
OF MUCH AMUSEMENT TO BOTH HER DAUGHTERS, AND PERCEIVING
THROUGH ALL HER AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION TO HERSELF,
HOW MUCH THE HEART OF MARIANNE WAS IN IT, WOULD NOT HEAR
OF THEIR DECLINING THE OFFER UPON HER ACCOUNT; INSISTED ON
THEIR BOTH ACCEPTING IT DIRECTLY; AND THEN BEGAN TO FORESEE,
WITH HER USUAL CHEERFULNESS, A VARIETY OF ADVANTAGES THAT
WOULD ACCRUE TO THEM ALL, FROM THIS SEPARATION.

"I AM DELIGHTED WITH THE PLAN," SHE CRIED,
"IT IS EXACTLY WHAT I COULD WISH.  MARGARET AND I SHALL
BE AS MUCH BENEFITED BY IT AS YOURSELVES.  WHEN YOU
AND THE MIDDLETONS ARE GONE, WE SHALL GO ON SO QUIETLY
AND HAPPILY TOGETHER WITH OUR BOOKS AND OUR MUSIC! YOU
WILL FIND MARGARET SO IMPROVED WHEN YOU COME BACK AGAIN!
I HAVE A LITTLE PLAN OF ALTERATION FOR YOUR BEDROOMS TOO,
WHICH MAY NOW BE PERFORMED WITHOUT ANY INCONVENIENCE
TO ANY ONE.  IT IS VERY RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD GO TO TOWN;
I WOULD HAVE EVERY YOUNG WOMAN OF YOUR CONDITION IN LIFE
ACQUAINTED WITH THE MANNERS AND AMUSEMENTS OF LONDON.
YOU WILL BE UNDER THE CARE OF A MOTHERLY GOOD SORT
OF WOMAN, OF WHOSE KINDNESS TO YOU I CAN HAVE NO DOUBT.
AND IN ALL PROBABILITY YOU WILL SEE YOUR BROTHER,
AND WHATEVER MAY BE HIS FAULTS, OR THE FAULTS OF HIS WIFE,
WHEN I CONSIDER WHOSE SON HE IS, I CANNOT BEAR TO HAVE YOU SO
WHOLLY ESTRANGED FROM EACH OTHER."

"THOUGH WITH YOUR USUAL ANXIETY FOR OUR HAPPINESS,"
SAID ELINOR, "YOU HAVE BEEN OBVIATING EVERY IMPEDIMENT
TO THE PRESENT SCHEME WHICH OCCURRED TO YOU, THERE IS
STILL ONE OBJECTION WHICH, IN MY OPINION, CANNOT BE SO
EASILY REMOVED."

MARIANNE'S COUNTENANCE SUNK.

"AND WHAT," SAID MRS. DASHWOOD, "IS MY DEAR PRUDENT
ELINOR GOING TO SUGGEST?  WHAT FORMIDABLE OBSTACLE IS SHE
NOW TO BRING FORWARD?  DO LET ME HEAR A WORD ABOUT THE
EXPENSE OF IT."

"MY OBJECTION IS THIS; THOUGH I THINK VERY WELL OF
MRS. JENNINGS'S HEART, SHE IS NOT A WOMAN WHOSE SOCIETY
CAN AFFORD US PLEASURE, OR WHOSE PROTECTION WILL GIVE
US CONSEQUENCE."

"THAT IS VERY TRUE," REPLIED HER MOTHER, "BUT OF
HER SOCIETY, SEPARATELY FROM THAT OF OTHER PEOPLE,
YOU WILL SCARCELY HAVE ANY THING AT ALL, AND YOU WILL
ALMOST ALWAYS APPEAR IN PUBLIC WITH LADY MIDDLETON."

"IF ELINOR IS FRIGHTENED AWAY BY HER DISLIKE OF
MRS. JENNINGS," SAID MARIANNE, "AT LEAST IT NEED NOT PREVENT
MY ACCEPTING HER INVITATION.  I HAVE NO SUCH SCRUPLES,
AND I AM SURE I COULD PUT UP WITH EVERY UNPLEASANTNESS
OF THAT KIND WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT."

ELINOR COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THIS DISPLAY OF
INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE MANNERS OF A PERSON, TO WHOM SHE
HAD OFTEN HAD DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING MARIANNE TO BEHAVE
WITH TOLERABLE POLITENESS; AND RESOLVED WITHIN HERSELF,
THAT IF HER SISTER PERSISTED IN GOING, SHE WOULD
GO LIKEWISE, AS SHE DID NOT THINK IT PROPER THAT MARIANNE
SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE SOLE GUIDANCE OF HER OWN JUDGMENT,
OR THAT MRS. JENNINGS SHOULD BE ABANDONED TO THE MERCY
OF MARIANNE FOR ALL THE COMFORT OF HER DOMESTIC HOURS.
TO THIS DETERMINATION SHE WAS THE MORE EASILY RECONCILED,
BY RECOLLECTING THAT EDWARD FERRARS, BY LUCY'S ACCOUNT,
WAS NOT TO BE IN TOWN BEFORE FEBRUARY; AND THAT
THEIR VISIT, WITHOUT ANY UNREASONABLE ABRIDGEMENT,
MIGHT BE PREVIOUSLY FINISHED.

"I WILL HAVE YOU BOTH GO," SAID MRS. DASHWOOD;
"THESE OBJECTIONS ARE NONSENSICAL.  YOU WILL HAVE MUCH
PLEASURE IN BEING IN LONDON, AND ESPECIALLY IN BEING TOGETHER;
AND IF ELINOR WOULD EVER CONDESCEND TO ANTICIPATE ENJOYMENT,
SHE WOULD FORESEE IT THERE FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES;
SHE WOULD, PERHAPS, EXPECT SOME FROM IMPROVING HER
ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER SISTER-IN-LAW'S FAMILY."

ELINOR HAD OFTEN WISHED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF
ATTEMPTING TO WEAKEN HER MOTHER'S DEPENDENCE ON THE
ATTACHMENT OF EDWARD AND HERSELF, THAT THE SHOCK MIGHT
BE LESS WHEN THE WHOLE TRUTH WERE REVEALED, AND NOW
ON THIS ATTACK, THOUGH ALMOST HOPELESS OF SUCCESS,
SHE FORCED HERSELF TO BEGIN HER DESIGN BY SAYING,
AS CALMLY AS SHE COULD, "I LIKE EDWARD FERRARS VERY MUCH,
AND SHALL ALWAYS BE GLAD TO SEE HIM; BUT AS TO THE REST
OF THE FAMILY, IT IS A MATTER OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE
TO ME, WHETHER I AM EVER KNOWN TO THEM OR NOT."

MRS. DASHWOOD SMILED, AND SAID NOTHING.
MARIANNE LIFTED UP HER EYES IN ASTONISHMENT, AND ELINOR
CONJECTURED THAT SHE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE HELD HER TONGUE.

AFTER VERY LITTLE FARTHER DISCOURSE, IT WAS FINALLY
SETTLED THAT THE INVITATION SHOULD BE FULLY ACCEPTED.
MRS. JENNINGS RECEIVED THE INFORMATION WITH A GREAT
DEAL OF JOY, AND MANY ASSURANCES OF KINDNESS AND CARE;
NOR WAS IT A MATTER OF PLEASURE MERELY TO HER.  SIR JOHN
WAS DELIGHTED; FOR TO A MAN, WHOSE PREVAILING ANXIETY
WAS THE DREAD OF BEING ALONE, THE ACQUISITION OF TWO,
TO THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS IN LONDON, WAS SOMETHING.
EVEN LADY MIDDLETON TOOK THE TROUBLE OF BEING DELIGHTED,
WHICH WAS PUTTING HERSELF RATHER OUT OF HER WAY;
AND AS FOR THE MISS STEELES, ESPECIALLY LUCY, THEY HAD
NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY IN THEIR LIVES AS THIS INTELLIGENCE
MADE THEM.

ELINOR SUBMITTED TO THE ARRANGEMENT WHICH COUNTERACTED
HER WISHES WITH LESS RELUCTANCE THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED
TO FEEL.  WITH REGARD TO HERSELF, IT WAS NOW A MATTER
OF UNCONCERN WHETHER SHE WENT TO TOWN OR NOT, AND WHEN
SHE SAW HER MOTHER SO THOROUGHLY PLEASED WITH THE PLAN,
AND HER SISTER EXHILARATED BY IT IN LOOK, VOICE, AND MANNER,
RESTORED TO ALL HER USUAL ANIMATION, AND ELEVATED TO MORE
THAN HER USUAL GAIETY, SHE COULD NOT BE DISSATISFIED
WITH THE CAUSE, AND WOULD HARDLY ALLOW HERSELF TO DISTRUST
THE CONSEQUENCE.

MARIANNE'S JOY WAS ALMOST A DEGREE BEYOND HAPPINESS,
SO GREAT WAS THE PERTURBATION OF HER SPIRITS AND HER
IMPATIENCE TO BE GONE.  HER UNWILLINGNESS TO QUIT HER
MOTHER WAS HER ONLY RESTORATIVE TO CALMNESS; AND AT THE
MOMENT OF PARTING HER GRIEF ON THAT SCORE WAS EXCESSIVE.
HER MOTHER'S AFFLICTION WAS HARDLY LESS, AND ELINOR
WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE THREE, WHO SEEMED TO CONSIDER
THE SEPARATION AS ANY THING SHORT OF ETERNAL.

THEIR DEPARTURE TOOK PLACE IN THE FIRST WEEK IN JANUARY.
THE MIDDLETONS WERE TO FOLLOW IN ABOUT A WEEK.  THE MISS
STEELES KEPT THEIR STATION AT THE PARK, AND WERE TO QUIT
IT ONLY WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY.



CHAPTER 26


ELINOR COULD NOT FIND HERSELF IN THE CARRIAGE WITH MRS. JENNINGS,
AND BEGINNING A JOURNEY TO LONDON UNDER HER PROTECTION,
AND AS HER GUEST, WITHOUT WONDERING AT HER OWN SITUATION,
SO SHORT HAD THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THAT LADY BEEN,
SO WHOLLY UNSUITED WERE THEY IN AGE AND DISPOSITION,
AND SO MANY HAD BEEN HER OBJECTIONS AGAINST SUCH A MEASURE
ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE! BUT THESE OBJECTIONS HAD ALL,
WITH THAT HAPPY ARDOUR OF YOUTH WHICH MARIANNE AND HER MOTHER
EQUALLY SHARED, BEEN OVERCOME OR OVERLOOKED; AND ELINOR,
IN SPITE OF EVERY OCCASIONAL DOUBT OF WILLOUGHBY'S CONSTANCY,
COULD NOT WITNESS THE RAPTURE OF DELIGHTFUL EXPECTATION
WHICH FILLED THE WHOLE SOUL AND BEAMED IN THE EYES
OF MARIANNE, WITHOUT FEELING HOW BLANK WAS HER OWN PROSPECT,
HOW CHEERLESS HER OWN STATE OF MIND IN THE COMPARISON,
AND HOW GLADLY SHE WOULD ENGAGE IN THE SOLICITUDE OF
MARIANNE'S SITUATION TO HAVE THE SAME ANIMATING OBJECT
IN VIEW, THE SAME POSSIBILITY OF HOPE.  A SHORT, A VERY
SHORT TIME HOWEVER MUST NOW DECIDE WHAT WILLOUGHBY'S
INTENTIONS WERE; IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WAS ALREADY IN TOWN.
MARIANNE'S EAGERNESS TO BE GONE DECLARED HER DEPENDENCE
ON FINDING HIM THERE; AND ELINOR WAS RESOLVED NOT ONLY UPON
GAINING EVERY NEW LIGHT AS TO HIS CHARACTER WHICH HER
OWN OBSERVATION OR THE INTELLIGENCE OF OTHERS COULD GIVE HER,
BUT LIKEWISE UPON WATCHING HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER SISTER
WITH SUCH ZEALOUS ATTENTION, AS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT HE WAS
AND WHAT HE MEANT, BEFORE MANY MEETINGS HAD TAKEN PLACE.
SHOULD THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS BE UNFAVOURABLE,
SHE WAS DETERMINED AT ALL EVENTS TO OPEN THE EYES
OF HER SISTER; SHOULD IT BE OTHERWISE, HER EXERTIONS
WOULD BE OF A DIFFERENT NATURE--SHE MUST THEN LEARN
TO AVOID EVERY SELFISH COMPARISON, AND BANISH EVERY REGRET
WHICH MIGHT LESSEN HER SATISFACTION IN THE HAPPINESS OF MARIANNE.

THEY WERE THREE DAYS ON THEIR JOURNEY, AND MARIANNE'S
BEHAVIOUR AS THEY TRAVELLED WAS A HAPPY SPECIMEN OF WHAT
FUTURE COMPLAISANCE AND COMPANIONABLENESS TO MRS. JENNINGS
MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO BE.  SHE SAT IN SILENCE ALMOST ALL
THE WAY, WRAPT IN HER OWN MEDITATIONS, AND SCARCELY EVER
VOLUNTARILY SPEAKING, EXCEPT WHEN ANY OBJECT OF PICTURESQUE
BEAUTY WITHIN THEIR VIEW DREW FROM HER AN EXCLAMATION
OF DELIGHT EXCLUSIVELY ADDRESSED TO HER SISTER.  TO ATONE
FOR THIS CONDUCT THEREFORE, ELINOR TOOK IMMEDIATE POSSESSION
OF THE POST OF CIVILITY WHICH SHE HAD ASSIGNED HERSELF,
BEHAVED WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION TO MRS. JENNINGS,
TALKED WITH HER, LAUGHED WITH HER, AND LISTENED TO HER
WHENEVER SHE COULD; AND MRS. JENNINGS ON HER SIDE
TREATED THEM BOTH WITH ALL POSSIBLE KINDNESS, WAS SOLICITOUS
ON EVERY OCCASION FOR THEIR EASE AND ENJOYMENT, AND ONLY
DISTURBED THAT SHE COULD NOT MAKE THEM CHOOSE THEIR OWN
DINNERS AT THE INN, NOR EXTORT A CONFESSION OF THEIR
PREFERRING SALMON TO COD, OR BOILED FOWLS TO VEAL CUTLETS.
THEY REACHED TOWN BY THREE O'CLOCK THE THIRD DAY, GLAD TO
BE RELEASED, AFTER SUCH A JOURNEY, FROM THE CONFINEMENT
OF A CARRIAGE, AND READY TO ENJOY ALL THE LUXURY OF A GOOD FIRE.

THE HOUSE WAS HANDSOME, AND HANDSOMELY FITTED UP,
AND THE YOUNG LADIES WERE IMMEDIATELY PUT IN POSSESSION
OF A VERY COMFORTABLE APARTMENT.  IT HAD FORMERLY
BEEN CHARLOTTE'S, AND OVER THE MANTELPIECE STILL HUNG
A LANDSCAPE IN COLOURED SILKS OF HER PERFORMANCE,
IN PROOF OF HER HAVING SPENT SEVEN YEARS AT A GREAT SCHOOL
IN TOWN TO SOME EFFECT.

AS DINNER WAS NOT TO BE READY IN LESS THAN TWO
HOURS FROM THEIR ARRIVAL, ELINOR DETERMINED TO EMPLOY
THE INTERVAL IN WRITING TO HER MOTHER, AND SAT DOWN FOR
THAT PURPOSE.  IN A FEW MOMENTS MARIANNE DID THE SAME.
"I AM WRITING HOME, MARIANNE," SAID ELINOR; "HAD NOT YOU
BETTER DEFER YOUR LETTER FOR A DAY OR TWO?"

"I AM NOT GOING TO WRITE TO MY MOTHER,"
REPLIED MARIANNE, HASTILY, AND AS IF WISHING TO AVOID
ANY FARTHER INQUIRY.  ELINOR SAID NO MORE; IT IMMEDIATELY
STRUCK HER THAT SHE MUST THEN BE WRITING TO WILLOUGHBY;
AND THE CONCLUSION WHICH AS INSTANTLY FOLLOWED WAS,
THAT, HOWEVER MYSTERIOUSLY THEY MIGHT WISH TO CONDUCT
THE AFFAIR, THEY MUST BE ENGAGED.  THIS CONVICTION,
THOUGH NOT ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY, GAVE HER PLEASURE,
AND SHE CONTINUED HER LETTER WITH GREATER ALACRITY.
MARIANNE'S WAS FINISHED IN A VERY FEW MINUTES;
IN LENGTH IT COULD BE NO MORE THAN A NOTE; IT WAS THEN
FOLDED UP, SEALED, AND DIRECTED WITH EAGER RAPIDITY.
ELINOR THOUGHT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH A LARGE W IN
THE DIRECTION; AND NO SOONER WAS IT COMPLETE THAN MARIANNE,
RINGING THE BELL, REQUESTED THE FOOTMAN WHO ANSWERED IT
TO GET THAT LETTER CONVEYED FOR HER TO THE TWO-PENNY POST.
THIS DECIDED THE MATTER AT ONCE.

HER SPIRITS STILL CONTINUED VERY HIGH; BUT THERE
WAS A FLUTTER IN THEM WHICH PREVENTED THEIR GIVING MUCH
PLEASURE TO HER SISTER, AND THIS AGITATION INCREASED AS
THE EVENING DREW ON.  SHE COULD SCARCELY EAT ANY DINNER,
AND WHEN THEY AFTERWARDS RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM,
SEEMED ANXIOUSLY LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF EVERY CARRIAGE.

IT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION TO ELINOR THAT MRS. JENNINGS,
BY BEING MUCH ENGAGED IN HER OWN ROOM, COULD SEE LITTLE
OF WHAT WAS PASSING.  THE TEA THINGS WERE BROUGHT IN,
AND ALREADY HAD MARIANNE BEEN DISAPPOINTED MORE THAN ONCE
BY A RAP AT A NEIGHBOURING DOOR, WHEN A LOUD ONE WAS SUDDENLY
HEARD WHICH COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR ONE AT ANY OTHER HOUSE,
ELINOR FELT SECURE OF ITS ANNOUNCING WILLOUGHBY'S APPROACH,
AND MARIANNE, STARTING UP, MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR.
EVERY THING WAS SILENT; THIS COULD NOT BE BORNE MANY SECONDS;
SHE OPENED THE DOOR, ADVANCED A FEW STEPS TOWARDS THE STAIRS,
AND AFTER LISTENING HALF A MINUTE, RETURNED INTO THE ROOM
IN ALL THE AGITATION WHICH A CONVICTION OF HAVING HEARD
HIM WOULD NATURALLY PRODUCE; IN THE ECSTASY OF HER
FEELINGS AT THAT INSTANT SHE COULD NOT HELP EXCLAIMING,
"OH, ELINOR, IT IS WILLOUGHBY, INDEED IT IS!" AND SEEMED
ALMOST READY TO THROW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS, WHEN COLONEL
BRANDON APPEARED.

IT WAS TOO GREAT A SHOCK TO BE BORNE WITH CALMNESS,
AND SHE IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE ROOM.  ELINOR WAS DISAPPOINTED TOO;
BUT AT THE SAME TIME HER REGARD FOR COLONEL BRANDON ENSURED
HIS WELCOME WITH HER; AND SHE FELT PARTICULARLY HURT THAT
A MAN SO PARTIAL TO HER SISTER SHOULD PERCEIVE THAT SHE
EXPERIENCED NOTHING BUT GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT IN SEEING HIM.
SHE INSTANTLY SAW THAT IT WAS NOT UNNOTICED BY HIM,
THAT HE EVEN OBSERVED MARIANNE AS SHE QUITTED THE ROOM,
WITH SUCH ASTONISHMENT AND CONCERN, AS HARDLY LEFT HIM
THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT CIVILITY DEMANDED TOWARDS HERSELF.

"IS YOUR SISTER ILL?" SAID HE.

ELINOR ANSWERED IN SOME DISTRESS THAT SHE WAS,
AND THEN TALKED OF HEAD-ACHES, LOW SPIRITS, AND OVER FATIGUES;
AND OF EVERY THING TO WHICH SHE COULD DECENTLY ATTRIBUTE
HER SISTER'S BEHAVIOUR.

HE HEARD HER WITH THE MOST EARNEST ATTENTION,
BUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF, SAID NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT,
AND BEGAN DIRECTLY TO SPEAK OF HIS PLEASURE AT SEEING THEM
IN LONDON, MAKING THE USUAL INQUIRIES ABOUT THEIR JOURNEY,
AND THE FRIENDS THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND.

IN THIS CALM KIND OF WAY, WITH VERY LITTLE INTEREST
ON EITHER SIDE, THEY CONTINUED TO TALK, BOTH OF THEM OUT
OF SPIRITS, AND THE THOUGHTS OF BOTH ENGAGED ELSEWHERE.
ELINOR WISHED VERY MUCH TO ASK WHETHER WILLOUGHBY WERE
THEN IN TOWN, BUT SHE WAS AFRAID OF GIVING HIM PAIN
BY ANY ENQUIRY AFTER HIS RIVAL; AND AT LENGTH, BY WAY
OF SAYING SOMETHING, SHE ASKED IF HE HAD BEEN IN LONDON
EVER SINCE SHE HAD SEEN HIM LAST.  "YES," HE REPLIED,
WITH SOME EMBARRASSMENT, "ALMOST EVER SINCE; I HAVE BEEN
ONCE OR TWICE AT DELAFORD FOR A FEW DAYS, BUT IT HAS NEVER
BEEN IN MY POWER TO RETURN TO BARTON."

THIS, AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS SAID,
IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT BACK TO HER REMEMBRANCE ALL THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS QUITTING THAT PLACE, WITH THE
UNEASINESS AND SUSPICIONS THEY HAD CAUSED TO MRS. JENNINGS,
AND SHE WAS FEARFUL THAT HER QUESTION HAD IMPLIED
MUCH MORE CURIOSITY ON THE SUBJECT THAN SHE HAD EVER FELT.

MRS. JENNINGS SOON CAME IN.  "OH! COLONEL," SAID SHE,
WITH HER USUAL NOISY CHEERFULNESS, "I AM MONSTROUS GLAD
TO SEE YOU--SORRY I COULD NOT COME BEFORE--BEG YOUR
PARDON, BUT I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LOOK ABOUT ME A LITTLE,
AND SETTLE MY MATTERS; FOR IT IS A LONG WHILE SINCE I
HAVE BEEN AT HOME, AND YOU KNOW ONE HAS ALWAYS A WORLD
OF LITTLE ODD THINGS TO DO AFTER ONE HAS BEEN AWAY FOR
ANY TIME; AND THEN I HAVE HAD CARTWRIGHT TO SETTLE WITH--
LORD, I HAVE BEEN AS BUSY AS A BEE EVER SINCE DINNER!
BUT PRAY, COLONEL, HOW CAME YOU TO CONJURE OUT THAT I SHOULD
BE IN TOWN TODAY?"

"I HAD THE PLEASURE OF HEARING IT AT MR. PALMER'S,
WHERE I HAVE BEEN DINING."

"OH, YOU DID; WELL, AND HOW DO THEY ALL DO AT THEIR
HOUSE?  HOW DOES CHARLOTTE DO?  I WARRANT YOU SHE IS A FINE
SIZE BY THIS TIME."

"MRS. PALMER APPEARED QUITE WELL, AND I AM COMMISSIONED
TO TELL YOU, THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY SEE HER TO-MORROW."

"AY, TO BE SURE, I THOUGHT AS MUCH.  WELL, COLONEL,
I HAVE BROUGHT TWO YOUNG LADIES WITH ME, YOU SEE--THAT IS,
YOU SEE BUT ONE OF THEM NOW, BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SOMEWHERE.
YOUR FRIEND, MISS MARIANNE, TOO--WHICH YOU WILL NOT BE
SORRY TO HEAR.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU AND MR. WILLOUGHBY
WILL DO BETWEEN YOU ABOUT HER.  AY, IT IS A FINE THING
TO BE YOUNG AND HANDSOME.  WELL! I WAS YOUNG ONCE, BUT I
NEVER WAS VERY HANDSOME--WORSE LUCK FOR ME.  HOWEVER, I GOT
A VERY GOOD HUSBAND, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE GREATEST
BEAUTY CAN DO MORE.  AH! POOR MAN! HE HAS BEEN DEAD
THESE EIGHT YEARS AND BETTER.  BUT COLONEL, WHERE HAVE
YOU BEEN TO SINCE WE PARTED?  AND HOW DOES YOUR BUSINESS
GO ON?  COME, COME, LET'S HAVE NO SECRETS AMONG FRIENDS."

HE REPLIED WITH HIS ACCUSTOMARY MILDNESS TO ALL
HER INQUIRIES, BUT WITHOUT SATISFYING HER IN ANY.
ELINOR NOW BEGAN TO MAKE THE TEA, AND MARIANNE WAS
OBLIGED TO APPEAR AGAIN.

AFTER HER ENTRANCE, COLONEL BRANDON BECAME
MORE THOUGHTFUL AND SILENT THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE,
AND MRS. JENNINGS COULD NOT PREVAIL ON HIM TO STAY LONG.
NO OTHER VISITOR APPEARED THAT EVENING, AND THE LADIES
WERE UNANIMOUS IN AGREEING TO GO EARLY TO BED.

MARIANNE ROSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH RECOVERED SPIRITS
AND HAPPY LOOKS.  THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE EVENING BEFORE
SEEMED FORGOTTEN IN THE EXPECTATION OF WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN
THAT DAY.  THEY HAD NOT LONG FINISHED THEIR BREAKFAST BEFORE
MRS. PALMER'S BAROUCHE STOPPED AT THE DOOR, AND IN A FEW
MINUTES SHE CAME LAUGHING INTO THE ROOM: SO DELIGHTED
TO SEE THEM ALL, THAT IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHETHER SHE
RECEIVED MOST PLEASURE FROM MEETING HER MOTHER OR THE MISS
DASHWOODS AGAIN.  SO SURPRISED AT THEIR COMING TO TOWN,
THOUGH IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD RATHER EXPECTED ALL ALONG;
SO ANGRY AT THEIR ACCEPTING HER MOTHER'S INVITATION
AFTER HAVING DECLINED HER OWN, THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME
SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE FORGIVEN THEM IF THEY HAD NOT COME!

"MR. PALMER WILL BE SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU,"
SAID SHE; "WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID WHEN HE HEARD
OF YOUR COMING WITH MAMMA?  I FORGET WHAT IT WAS NOW,
BUT IT WAS SOMETHING SO DROLL!"

AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO SPENT IN WHAT HER MOTHER CALLED
COMFORTABLE CHAT, OR IN OTHER WORDS, IN EVERY VARIETY OF INQUIRY
CONCERNING ALL THEIR ACQUAINTANCE ON MRS. JENNINGS'S SIDE,
AND IN LAUGHTER WITHOUT CAUSE ON MRS. PALMER'S, IT WAS
PROPOSED BY THE LATTER THAT THEY SHOULD ALL ACCOMPANY
HER TO SOME SHOPS WHERE SHE HAD BUSINESS THAT MORNING,
TO WHICH MRS. JENNINGS AND ELINOR READILY CONSENTED,
AS HAVING LIKEWISE SOME PURCHASES TO MAKE THEMSELVES;
AND MARIANNE, THOUGH DECLINING IT AT FIRST WAS INDUCED
TO GO LIKEWISE.

WHEREVER THEY WENT, SHE WAS EVIDENTLY ALWAYS ON
THE WATCH.  IN BOND STREET ESPECIALLY, WHERE MUCH OF
THEIR BUSINESS LAY, HER EYES WERE IN CONSTANT INQUIRY;
AND IN WHATEVER SHOP THE PARTY WERE ENGAGED, HER MIND WAS
EQUALLY ABSTRACTED FROM EVERY THING ACTUALLY BEFORE THEM,
FROM ALL THAT INTERESTED AND OCCUPIED THE OTHERS.
RESTLESS AND DISSATISFIED EVERY WHERE, HER SISTER COULD
NEVER OBTAIN HER OPINION OF ANY ARTICLE OF PURCHASE,
HOWEVER IT MIGHT EQUALLY CONCERN THEM BOTH: SHE RECEIVED
NO PLEASURE FROM ANYTHING; WAS ONLY IMPATIENT TO BE AT
HOME AGAIN, AND COULD WITH DIFFICULTY GOVERN HER VEXATION
AT THE TEDIOUSNESS OF MRS. PALMER, WHOSE EYE WAS CAUGHT
BY EVERY THING PRETTY, EXPENSIVE, OR NEW; WHO WAS WILD
TO BUY ALL, COULD DETERMINE ON NONE, AND DAWDLED AWAY HER
TIME IN RAPTURE AND INDECISION.

IT WAS LATE IN THE MORNING BEFORE THEY RETURNED HOME;
AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE THAN MARIANNE FLEW
EAGERLY UP STAIRS, AND WHEN ELINOR FOLLOWED, SHE FOUND
HER TURNING FROM THE TABLE WITH A SORROWFUL COUNTENANCE,
WHICH DECLARED THAT NO WILLOUGHBY HAD BEEN THERE.

"HAS NO LETTER BEEN LEFT HERE FOR ME SINCE WE WENT OUT?"
SAID SHE TO THE FOOTMAN WHO THEN ENTERED WITH THE PARCELS.
SHE WAS ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE.  "ARE YOU QUITE SURE
OF IT?" SHE REPLIED.  "ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT NO SERVANT,
NO PORTER HAS LEFT ANY LETTER OR NOTE?"

THE MAN REPLIED THAT NONE HAD.

"HOW VERY ODD!" SAID SHE, IN A LOW AND DISAPPOINTED
VOICE, AS SHE TURNED AWAY TO THE WINDOW.

"HOW ODD, INDEED!" REPEATED ELINOR WITHIN HERSELF,
REGARDING HER SISTER WITH UNEASINESS.  "IF SHE HAD NOT
KNOWN HIM TO BE IN TOWN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM,
AS SHE DID; SHE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO COMBE MAGNA;
AND IF HE IS IN TOWN, HOW ODD THAT HE SHOULD NEITHER
COME NOR WRITE!  OH! MY DEAR MOTHER, YOU MUST BE WRONG
IN PERMITTING AN ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN A DAUGHTER SO YOUNG,
A MAN SO LITTLE KNOWN, TO BE CARRIED ON IN SO DOUBTFUL,
SO MYSTERIOUS A MANNER!  I LONG TO INQUIRE; AND HOW WILL MY
INTERFERENCE BE BORNE."

SHE DETERMINED, AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION, THAT IF
APPEARANCES CONTINUED MANY DAYS LONGER AS UNPLEASANT AS THEY
NOW WERE, SHE WOULD REPRESENT IN THE STRONGEST MANNER
TO HER MOTHER THE NECESSITY OF SOME SERIOUS ENQUIRY INTO THE
AFFAIR.

MRS. PALMER AND TWO ELDERLY LADIES OF MRS. JENNINGS'S
INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE, WHOM SHE HAD MET AND INVITED
IN THE MORNING, DINED WITH THEM.  THE FORMER LEFT THEM
SOON AFTER TEA TO FULFILL HER EVENING ENGAGEMENTS;
AND ELINOR WAS OBLIGED TO ASSIST IN MAKING A WHIST TABLE
FOR THE OTHERS.  MARIANNE WAS OF NO USE ON THESE OCCASIONS,
AS SHE WOULD NEVER LEARN THE GAME; BUT THOUGH HER TIME
WAS THEREFORE AT HER OWN DISPOSAL, THE EVENING WAS BY NO
MEANS MORE PRODUCTIVE OF PLEASURE TO HER THAN TO ELINOR,
FOR IT WAS SPENT IN ALL THE ANXIETY OF EXPECTATION AND THE
PAIN OF DISAPPOINTMENT.  SHE SOMETIMES ENDEAVOURED FOR A
FEW MINUTES TO READ; BUT THE BOOK WAS SOON THROWN ASIDE,
AND SHE RETURNED TO THE MORE INTERESTING EMPLOYMENT
OF WALKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ACROSS THE ROOM,
PAUSING FOR A MOMENT WHENEVER SHE CAME TO THE WINDOW,
IN HOPES OF DISTINGUISHING THE LONG-EXPECTED RAP.



CHAPTER 27


"IF THIS OPEN WEATHER HOLDS MUCH LONGER," SAID MRS. JENNINGS,
WHEN THEY MET AT BREAKFAST THE FOLLOWING MORNING,
"SIR JOHN WILL NOT LIKE LEAVING BARTON NEXT WEEK;
'TIS A SAD THING FOR SPORTSMEN TO LOSE A DAY'S PLEASURE.
POOR SOULS!  I ALWAYS PITY THEM WHEN THEY DO; THEY SEEM
TO TAKE IT SO MUCH TO HEART."

"THAT IS TRUE," CRIED MARIANNE, IN A CHEERFUL VOICE,
AND WALKING TO THE WINDOW AS SHE SPOKE, TO EXAMINE THE DAY.
"I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT.  THIS WEATHER WILL KEEP MANY
SPORTSMEN IN THE COUNTRY."

IT WAS A LUCKY RECOLLECTION, ALL HER GOOD SPIRITS WERE
RESTORED BY IT.  "IT IS CHARMING WEATHER FOR THEM INDEED,"
SHE CONTINUED, AS SHE SAT DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST TABLE
WITH A HAPPY COUNTENANCE.  "HOW MUCH THEY MUST ENJOY
IT! BUT" (WITH A LITTLE RETURN OF ANXIETY) "IT CANNOT
BE EXPECTED TO LAST LONG.  AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR,
AND AFTER SUCH A SERIES OF RAIN, WE SHALL CERTAINLY
HAVE VERY LITTLE MORE OF IT.  FROSTS WILL SOON SET IN,
AND IN ALL PROBABILITY WITH SEVERITY.  IN ANOTHER DAY
OR TWO PERHAPS; THIS EXTREME MILDNESS CAN HARDLY LAST
LONGER--NAY, PERHAPS IT MAY FREEZE TONIGHT!"

"AT ANY RATE," SAID ELINOR, WISHING TO PREVENT
MRS. JENNINGS FROM SEEING HER SISTER'S THOUGHTS AS CLEARLY
AS SHE DID, "I DARE SAY WE SHALL HAVE SIR JOHN AND LADY
MIDDLETON IN TOWN BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK."

"AY, MY DEAR, I'LL WARRANT YOU WE DO.  MARY ALWAYS
HAS HER OWN WAY."

"AND NOW," SILENTLY CONJECTURED ELINOR, "SHE WILL
WRITE TO COMBE BY THIS DAY'S POST."

BUT IF SHE DID, THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND SENT AWAY
WITH A PRIVACY WHICH ELUDED ALL HER WATCHFULNESS TO ASCERTAIN
THE FACT.  WHATEVER THE TRUTH OF IT MIGHT BE, AND FAR
AS ELINOR WAS FROM FEELING THOROUGH CONTENTMENT ABOUT IT,
YET WHILE SHE SAW MARIANNE IN SPIRITS, SHE COULD NOT BE
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE HERSELF.  AND MARIANNE WAS IN SPIRITS;
HAPPY IN THE MILDNESS OF THE WEATHER, AND STILL HAPPIER
IN HER EXPECTATION OF A FROST.

THE MORNING WAS CHIEFLY SPENT IN LEAVING CARDS AT
THE HOUSES OF MRS. JENNINGS'S ACQUAINTANCE TO INFORM
THEM OF HER BEING IN TOWN; AND MARIANNE WAS ALL THE TIME
BUSY IN OBSERVING THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND, WATCHING THE
VARIATIONS OF THE SKY AND IMAGINING AN ALTERATION IN THE AIR.

"DON'T YOU FIND IT COLDER THAN IT WAS IN THE MORNING,
ELINOR? THERE SEEMS TO ME A VERY DECIDED DIFFERENCE.
I CAN HARDLY KEEP MY HANDS WARM EVEN IN MY MUFF.  IT WAS
NOT SO YESTERDAY, I THINK.  THE CLOUDS SEEM PARTING TOO,
THE SUN WILL BE OUT IN A MOMENT, AND WE SHALL HAVE A
CLEAR AFTERNOON."

ELINOR WAS ALTERNATELY DIVERTED AND PAINED;
BUT MARIANNE PERSEVERED, AND SAW EVERY NIGHT IN THE
BRIGHTNESS OF THE FIRE, AND EVERY MORNING IN THE APPEARANCE
OF THE ATMOSPHERE, THE CERTAIN SYMPTOMS OF APPROACHING FROST.

THE MISS DASHWOODS HAD NO GREATER REASON TO BE
DISSATISFIED WITH MRS. JENNINGS'S STYLE OF LIVING, AND SET
OF ACQUAINTANCE, THAN WITH HER BEHAVIOUR TO THEMSELVES,
WHICH WAS INVARIABLY KIND.  EVERY THING IN HER HOUSEHOLD
ARRANGEMENTS WAS CONDUCTED ON THE MOST LIBERAL PLAN,
AND EXCEPTING A FEW OLD CITY FRIENDS, WHOM, TO LADY
MIDDLETON'S REGRET, SHE HAD NEVER DROPPED, SHE VISITED
NO ONE TO WHOM AN INTRODUCTION COULD AT ALL DISCOMPOSE
THE FEELINGS OF HER YOUNG COMPANIONS.  PLEASED TO FIND
HERSELF MORE COMFORTABLY SITUATED IN THAT PARTICULAR THAN
SHE HAD EXPECTED, ELINOR WAS VERY WILLING TO COMPOUND
FOR THE WANT OF MUCH REAL ENJOYMENT FROM ANY OF THEIR
EVENING PARTIES, WHICH, WHETHER AT HOME OR ABROAD,
FORMED ONLY FOR CARDS, COULD HAVE LITTLE TO AMUSE HER.

COLONEL BRANDON, WHO HAD A GENERAL INVITATION
TO THE HOUSE, WAS WITH THEM ALMOST EVERY DAY; HE CAME
TO LOOK AT MARIANNE AND TALK TO ELINOR, WHO OFTEN DERIVED
MORE SATISFACTION FROM CONVERSING WITH HIM THAN FROM ANY
OTHER DAILY OCCURRENCE, BUT WHO SAW AT THE SAME TIME
WITH MUCH CONCERN HIS CONTINUED REGARD FOR HER SISTER.
SHE FEARED IT WAS A STRENGTHENING REGARD.  IT GRIEVED HER
TO SEE THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH HE OFTEN WATCHED MARIANNE,
AND HIS SPIRITS WERE CERTAINLY WORSE THAN WHEN AT BARTON.

ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL, IT BECAME
CERTAIN THAT WILLOUGHBY WAS ALSO ARRIVED.  HIS CARD
WAS ON THE TABLE WHEN THEY CAME IN FROM THE MORNING'S DRIVE.

"GOOD GOD!" CRIED MARIANNE, "HE HAS BEEN HERE WHILE
WE WERE OUT."  ELINOR, REJOICED TO BE ASSURED OF HIS
BEING IN LONDON, NOW VENTURED TO SAY, "DEPEND UPON IT,
HE WILL CALL AGAIN TOMORROW."  BUT MARIANNE SEEMED
HARDLY TO HEAR HER, AND ON MRS. JENNING'S ENTRANCE,
ESCAPED WITH THE PRECIOUS CARD.

THIS EVENT, WHILE IT RAISED THE SPIRITS OF ELINOR,
RESTORED TO THOSE OF HER SISTER ALL, AND MORE THAN ALL,
THEIR FORMER AGITATION.  FROM THIS MOMENT HER MIND WAS
NEVER QUIET; THE EXPECTATION OF SEEING HIM EVERY HOUR
OF THE DAY, MADE HER UNFIT FOR ANY THING.  SHE INSISTED
ON BEING LEFT BEHIND, THE NEXT MORNING, WHEN THE OTHERS
WENT OUT.

ELINOR'S THOUGHTS WERE FULL OF WHAT MIGHT BE PASSING
IN BERKELEY STREET DURING THEIR ABSENCE; BUT A MOMENT'S
GLANCE AT HER SISTER WHEN THEY RETURNED WAS ENOUGH TO
INFORM HER, THAT WILLOUGHBY HAD PAID NO SECOND VISIT THERE.
A NOTE WAS JUST THEN BROUGHT IN, AND LAID ON THE TABLE,

"FOR ME!" CRIED MARIANNE, STEPPING HASTILY FORWARD.

"NO, MA'AM, FOR MY MISTRESS."

BUT MARIANNE, NOT CONVINCED, TOOK IT INSTANTLY UP.

"IT IS INDEED FOR MRS. JENNINGS; HOW PROVOKING!"

"YOU ARE EXPECTING A LETTER, THEN?" SAID ELINOR,
UNABLE TO BE LONGER SILENT.

"YES, A LITTLE--NOT MUCH."

AFTER A SHORT PAUSE.  "YOU HAVE NO CONFIDENCE
IN ME, MARIANNE."

"NAY, ELINOR, THIS REPROACH FROM YOU--YOU WHO HAVE
CONFIDENCE IN NO ONE!"

"ME!" RETURNED ELINOR IN SOME CONFUSION; "INDEED,
MARIANNE, I HAVE NOTHING TO TELL."

"NOR I," ANSWERED MARIANNE WITH ENERGY, "OUR SITUATIONS
THEN ARE ALIKE.  WE HAVE NEITHER OF US ANY THING TO TELL;
YOU, BECAUSE YOU DO NOT COMMUNICATE, AND I, BECAUSE
I CONCEAL NOTHING."

ELINOR, DISTRESSED BY THIS CHARGE OF RESERVE IN HERSELF,
WHICH SHE WAS NOT AT LIBERTY TO DO AWAY, KNEW NOT HOW,
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, TO PRESS FOR GREATER OPENNESS
IN MARIANNE.

MRS. JENNINGS SOON APPEARED, AND THE NOTE BEING
GIVEN HER, SHE READ IT ALOUD.  IT WAS FROM LADY MIDDLETON,
ANNOUNCING THEIR ARRIVAL IN CONDUIT STREET THE NIGHT BEFORE,
AND REQUESTING THE COMPANY OF HER MOTHER AND COUSINS
THE FOLLOWING EVENING.  BUSINESS ON SIR JOHN'S PART,
AND A VIOLENT COLD ON HER OWN, PREVENTED THEIR CALLING
IN BERKELEY STREET.  THE INVITATION WAS ACCEPTED;
BUT WHEN THE HOUR OF APPOINTMENT DREW NEAR, NECESSARY AS
IT WAS IN COMMON CIVILITY TO MRS. JENNINGS, THAT THEY
SHOULD BOTH ATTEND HER ON SUCH A VISIT, ELINOR HAD SOME
DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING HER SISTER TO GO, FOR STILL
SHE HAD SEEN NOTHING OF WILLOUGHBY; AND THEREFORE WAS
NOT MORE INDISPOSED FOR AMUSEMENT ABROAD, THAN UNWILLING
TO RUN THE RISK OF HIS CALLING AGAIN IN HER ABSENCE.

ELINOR FOUND, WHEN THE EVENING WAS OVER,
THAT DISPOSITION IS NOT MATERIALLY ALTERED BY A CHANGE
OF ABODE, FOR ALTHOUGH SCARCELY SETTLED IN TOWN,
SIR JOHN HAD CONTRIVED TO COLLECT AROUND HIM, NEARLY TWENTY
YOUNG PEOPLE, AND TO AMUSE THEM WITH A BALL.  THIS WAS
AN AFFAIR, HOWEVER, OF WHICH LADY MIDDLETON DID NOT APPROVE.
IN THE COUNTRY, AN UNPREMEDITATED DANCE WAS VERY ALLOWABLE;
BUT IN LONDON, WHERE THE REPUTATION OF ELEGANCE WAS MORE
IMPORTANT AND LESS EASILY ATTAINED, IT WAS RISKING TOO MUCH
FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF A FEW GIRLS, TO HAVE IT KNOWN THAT
LADY MIDDLETON HAD GIVEN A SMALL DANCE OF EIGHT OR NINE COUPLE,
WITH TWO VIOLINS, AND A MERE SIDE-BOARD COLLATION.

MR. AND MRS. PALMER WERE OF THE PARTY; FROM THE FORMER,
WHOM THEY HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE SINCE THEIR ARRIVAL IN TOWN,
AS HE WAS CAREFUL TO AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF ANY ATTENTION
TO HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW, AND THEREFORE NEVER CAME NEAR HER,
THEY RECEIVED NO MARK OF RECOGNITION ON THEIR ENTRANCE.
HE LOOKED AT THEM SLIGHTLY, WITHOUT SEEMING TO KNOW
WHO THEY WERE, AND MERELY NODDED TO MRS. JENNINGS FROM
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.  MARIANNE GAVE ONE GLANCE
ROUND THE APARTMENT AS SHE ENTERED: IT WAS ENOUGH--HE
WAS NOT THERE--AND SHE SAT DOWN, EQUALLY ILL-DISPOSED
TO RECEIVE OR COMMUNICATE PLEASURE.  AFTER THEY HAD BEEN
ASSEMBLED ABOUT AN HOUR, MR. PALMER SAUNTERED TOWARDS
THE MISS DASHWOODS TO EXPRESS HIS SURPRISE ON SEEING THEM
IN TOWN, THOUGH COLONEL BRANDON HAD BEEN FIRST INFORMED
OF THEIR ARRIVAL AT HIS HOUSE, AND HE HAD HIMSELF SAID
SOMETHING VERY DROLL ON HEARING THAT THEY WERE TO COME.

"I THOUGHT YOU WERE BOTH IN DEVONSHIRE," SAID HE.

"DID YOU?" REPLIED ELINOR.

"WHEN DO YOU GO BACK AGAIN?"

"I DO NOT KNOW." AND THUS ENDED THEIR DISCOURSE.

NEVER HAD MARIANNE BEEN SO UNWILLING TO DANCE
IN HER LIFE, AS SHE WAS THAT EVENING, AND NEVER SO MUCH
FATIGUED BY THE EXERCISE.  SHE COMPLAINED OF IT
AS THEY RETURNED TO BERKELEY STREET.

"AYE, AYE," SAID MRS. JENNINGS, "WE KNOW THE REASON
OF ALL THAT VERY WELL; IF A CERTAIN PERSON WHO SHALL
BE NAMELESS, HAD BEEN THERE, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A
BIT TIRED: AND TO SAY THE TRUTH IT WAS NOT VERY PRETTY
OF HIM NOT TO GIVE YOU THE MEETING WHEN HE WAS INVITED."

"INVITED!" CRIED MARIANNE.

"SO MY DAUGHTER MIDDLETON TOLD ME, FOR IT SEEMS SIR
JOHN MET HIM SOMEWHERE IN THE STREET THIS MORNING."
MARIANNE SAID NO MORE, BUT LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY HURT.
IMPATIENT IN THIS SITUATION TO BE DOING SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT LEAD TO HER SISTER'S RELIEF, ELINOR RESOLVED
TO WRITE THE NEXT MORNING TO HER MOTHER, AND HOPED
BY AWAKENING HER FEARS FOR THE HEALTH OF MARIANNE,
TO PROCURE THOSE INQUIRIES WHICH HAD BEEN SO LONG DELAYED;
AND SHE WAS STILL MORE EAGERLY BENT ON THIS MEASURE
BY PERCEIVING AFTER BREAKFAST ON THE MORROW, THAT MARIANNE
WAS AGAIN WRITING TO WILLOUGHBY, FOR SHE COULD NOT SUPPOSE
IT TO BE TO ANY OTHER PERSON.

ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, MRS. JENNINGS WENT OUT BY
HERSELF ON BUSINESS, AND ELINOR BEGAN HER LETTER DIRECTLY,
WHILE MARIANNE, TOO RESTLESS FOR EMPLOYMENT, TOO ANXIOUS
FOR CONVERSATION, WALKED FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER,
OR SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE IN MELANCHOLY MEDITATION.
ELINOR WAS VERY EARNEST IN HER APPLICATION TO HER MOTHER,
RELATING ALL THAT HAD PASSED, HER SUSPICIONS OF
WILLOUGHBY'S INCONSTANCY, URGING HER BY EVERY PLEA
OF DUTY AND AFFECTION TO DEMAND FROM MARIANNE AN ACCOUNT
OF HER REAL SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO HIM.

HER LETTER WAS SCARCELY FINISHED, WHEN A RAP
FORETOLD A VISITOR, AND COLONEL BRANDON WAS ANNOUNCED.
MARIANNE, WHO HAD SEEN HIM FROM THE WINDOW, AND WHO HATED
COMPANY OF ANY KIND, LEFT THE ROOM BEFORE HE ENTERED IT.
HE LOOKED MORE THAN USUALLY GRAVE, AND THOUGH EXPRESSING
SATISFACTION AT FINDING MISS DASHWOOD ALONE, AS IF HE
HAD SOMEWHAT IN PARTICULAR TO TELL HER, SAT FOR SOME
TIME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD.  ELINOR, PERSUADED THAT HE
HAD SOME COMMUNICATION TO MAKE IN WHICH HER SISTER
WAS CONCERNED, IMPATIENTLY EXPECTED ITS OPENING.
IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME OF HER FEELING THE SAME KIND
OF CONVICTION; FOR, MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE, BEGINNING WITH
THE OBSERVATION OF "YOUR SISTER LOOKS UNWELL TO-DAY,"
OR "YOUR SISTER SEEMS OUT OF SPIRITS," HE HAD APPEARED
ON THE POINT, EITHER OF DISCLOSING, OR OF INQUIRING,
SOMETHING PARTICULAR ABOUT HER.  AFTER A PAUSE OF SEVERAL
MINUTES, THEIR SILENCE WAS BROKEN, BY HIS ASKING HER
IN A VOICE OF SOME AGITATION, WHEN HE WAS TO CONGRATULATE
HER ON THE ACQUISITION OF A BROTHER?  ELINOR WAS NOT
PREPARED FOR SUCH A QUESTION, AND HAVING NO ANSWER READY,
WAS OBLIGED TO ADOPT THE SIMPLE AND COMMON EXPEDIENT,
OF ASKING WHAT HE MEANT?  HE TRIED TO SMILE AS HE REPLIED,
"YOUR SISTER'S ENGAGEMENT TO MR. WILLOUGHBY IS VERY GENERALLY
KNOWN."

"IT CANNOT BE GENERALLY KNOWN," RETURNED ELINOR,
"FOR HER OWN FAMILY DO NOT KNOW IT."

HE LOOKED SURPRISED AND SAID, "I BEG YOUR PARDON,
I AM AFRAID MY INQUIRY HAS BEEN IMPERTINENT; BUT I HAD NOT
SUPPOSED ANY SECRECY INTENDED, AS THEY OPENLY CORRESPOND,
AND THEIR MARRIAGE IS UNIVERSALLY TALKED OF."

"HOW CAN THAT BE? BY WHOM CAN YOU HAVE HEARD
IT MENTIONED?"

"BY MANY--BY SOME OF WHOM YOU KNOW NOTHING, BY OTHERS
WITH WHOM YOU ARE MOST INTIMATE, MRS. JENNINGS, MRS. PALMER,
AND THE MIDDLETONS.  BUT STILL I MIGHT NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT,
FOR WHERE THE MIND IS PERHAPS RATHER UNWILLING TO
BE CONVINCED, IT WILL ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO SUPPORT
ITS DOUBTS, IF I HAD NOT, WHEN THE SERVANT LET ME IN TODAY,
ACCIDENTALLY SEEN A LETTER IN HIS HAND, DIRECTED TO
MR. WILLOUGHBY IN YOUR SISTER'S WRITING.  I CAME TO INQUIRE,
BUT I WAS CONVINCED BEFORE I COULD ASK THE QUESTION.
IS EVERY THING FINALLY SETTLED?  IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO-?
BUT I HAVE NO RIGHT, AND I COULD HAVE NO CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING.
EXCUSE ME, MISS DASHWOOD.  I BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN WRONG
IN SAYING SO MUCH, BUT I HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO DO, AND ON
YOUR PRUDENCE I HAVE THE STRONGEST DEPENDENCE.  TELL ME
THAT IT IS ALL ABSOLUTELY RESOLVED ON, THAT ANY ATTEMPT,
THAT IN SHORT CONCEALMENT, IF CONCEALMENT BE POSSIBLE,
IS ALL THAT REMAINS."

THESE WORDS, WHICH CONVEYED TO ELINOR A DIRECT AVOWAL
OF HIS LOVE FOR HER SISTER, AFFECTED HER VERY MUCH.
SHE WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING, AND EVEN
WHEN HER SPIRITS WERE RECOVERED, SHE DEBATED FOR A SHORT
TIME, ON THE ANSWER IT WOULD BE MOST PROPER TO GIVE.
THE REAL STATE OF THINGS BETWEEN WILLOUGHBY AND HER SISTER
WAS SO LITTLE KNOWN TO HERSELF, THAT IN ENDEAVOURING
TO EXPLAIN IT, SHE MIGHT BE AS LIABLE TO SAY TOO MUCH
AS TOO LITTLE.  YET AS SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT MARIANNE'S
AFFECTION FOR WILLOUGHBY, COULD LEAVE NO HOPE OF COLONEL
BRANDON'S SUCCESS, WHATEVER THE EVENT OF THAT AFFECTION
MIGHT BE, AND AT THE SAME TIME WISHED TO SHIELD HER CONDUCT
FROM CENSURE, SHE THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT AND KIND,
AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION, TO SAY MORE THAN SHE REALLY KNEW
OR BELIEVED.  SHE ACKNOWLEDGED, THEREFORE, THAT THOUGH
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN INFORMED BY THEMSELVES OF THE TERMS
ON WHICH THEY STOOD WITH EACH OTHER, OF THEIR MUTUAL
AFFECTION SHE HAD NO DOUBT, AND OF THEIR CORRESPONDENCE
SHE WAS NOT ASTONISHED TO HEAR.

HE LISTENED TO HER WITH SILENT ATTENTION, AND ON
HER CEASING TO SPEAK, ROSE DIRECTLY FROM HIS SEAT,
AND AFTER SAYING IN A VOICE OF EMOTION, "TO YOUR SISTER
I WISH ALL IMAGINABLE HAPPINESS; TO WILLOUGHBY THAT HE
MAY ENDEAVOUR TO DESERVE HER,"--TOOK LEAVE, AND WENT AWAY.

ELINOR DERIVED NO COMFORTABLE FEELINGS FROM THIS
CONVERSATION, TO LESSEN THE UNEASINESS OF HER MIND ON
OTHER POINTS; SHE WAS LEFT, ON THE CONTRARY, WITH A
MELANCHOLY IMPRESSION OF COLONEL BRANDON'S UNHAPPINESS,
AND WAS PREVENTED EVEN FROM WISHING IT REMOVED,
BY HER ANXIETY FOR THE VERY EVENT THAT MUST CONFIRM IT.



CHAPTER 28


NOTHING OCCURRED DURING THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR DAYS,
TO MAKE ELINOR REGRET WHAT SHE HAD DONE, IN APPLYING
TO HER MOTHER; FOR WILLOUGHBY NEITHER CAME NOR WROTE.
THEY WERE ENGAGED ABOUT THE END OF THAT TIME TO ATTEND
LADY MIDDLETON TO A PARTY, FROM WHICH MRS. JENNINGS WAS
KEPT AWAY BY THE INDISPOSITION OF HER YOUNGEST DAUGHTER;
AND FOR THIS PARTY, MARIANNE, WHOLLY DISPIRITED,
CARELESS OF HER APPEARANCE, AND SEEMING EQUALLY INDIFFERENT
WHETHER SHE WENT OR STAID, PREPARED, WITHOUT ONE LOOK
OF HOPE OR ONE EXPRESSION OF PLEASURE.  SHE SAT BY THE
DRAWING-ROOM FIRE AFTER TEA, TILL THE MOMENT OF LADY
MIDDLETON'S ARRIVAL, WITHOUT ONCE STIRRING FROM HER SEAT,
OR ALTERING HER ATTITUDE, LOST IN HER OWN THOUGHTS,
AND INSENSIBLE OF HER SISTER'S PRESENCE; AND WHEN AT
LAST THEY WERE TOLD THAT LADY MIDDLETON WAITED FOR THEM
AT THE DOOR, SHE STARTED AS IF SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT
ANY ONE WAS EXPECTED.

THEY ARRIVED IN DUE TIME AT THE PLACE OF DESTINATION,
AND AS SOON AS THE STRING OF CARRIAGES BEFORE THEM
WOULD ALLOW, ALIGHTED, ASCENDED THE STAIRS, HEARD THEIR
NAMES ANNOUNCED FROM ONE LANDING-PLACE TO ANOTHER IN AN
AUDIBLE VOICE, AND ENTERED A ROOM SPLENDIDLY LIT UP,
QUITE FULL OF COMPANY, AND INSUFFERABLY HOT.  WHEN THEY HAD
PAID THEIR TRIBUTE OF POLITENESS BY CURTSYING TO THE LADY
OF THE HOUSE, THEY WERE PERMITTED TO MINGLE IN THE CROWD,
AND TAKE THEIR SHARE OF THE HEAT AND INCONVENIENCE, TO
WHICH THEIR ARRIVAL MUST NECESSARILY ADD.  AFTER SOME TIME
SPENT IN SAYING LITTLE OR DOING LESS, LADY MIDDLETON SAT
DOWN TO CASSINO, AND AS MARIANNE WAS NOT IN SPIRITS FOR
MOVING ABOUT, SHE AND ELINOR LUCKILY SUCCEEDING TO CHAIRS,
PLACED THEMSELVES AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE TABLE.

THEY HAD NOT REMAINED IN THIS MANNER LONG, BEFORE ELINOR
PERCEIVED WILLOUGHBY, STANDING WITHIN A FEW YARDS
OF THEM, IN EARNEST CONVERSATION WITH A VERY FASHIONABLE
LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN.  SHE SOON CAUGHT HIS EYE, AND HE
IMMEDIATELY BOWED, BUT WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO SPEAK TO HER,
OR TO APPROACH MARIANNE, THOUGH HE COULD NOT BUT SEE HER;
AND THEN CONTINUED HIS DISCOURSE WITH THE SAME LADY.
ELINOR TURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO MARIANNE, TO SEE WHETHER
IT COULD BE UNOBSERVED BY HER.  AT THAT MOMENT SHE FIRST
PERCEIVED HIM, AND HER WHOLE COUNTENANCE GLOWING WITH
SUDDEN DELIGHT, SHE WOULD HAVE MOVED TOWARDS HIM INSTANTLY,
HAD NOT HER SISTER CAUGHT HOLD OF HER.

"GOOD HEAVENS!" SHE EXCLAIMED, "HE IS THERE--HE
IS THERE--OH! WHY DOES HE NOT LOOK AT ME? WHY CANNOT
I SPEAK TO HIM?"

"PRAY, PRAY BE COMPOSED," CRIED ELINOR, "AND DO
NOT BETRAY WHAT YOU FEEL TO EVERY BODY PRESENT.
PERHAPS HE HAS NOT OBSERVED YOU YET."

THIS HOWEVER WAS MORE THAN SHE COULD BELIEVE HERSELF;
AND TO BE COMPOSED AT SUCH A MOMENT WAS NOT ONLY BEYOND
THE REACH OF MARIANNE, IT WAS BEYOND HER WISH.  SHE SAT
IN AN AGONY OF IMPATIENCE WHICH AFFECTED EVERY FEATURE.

AT LAST HE TURNED ROUND AGAIN, AND REGARDED THEM BOTH;
SHE STARTED UP, AND PRONOUNCING HIS NAME IN A TONE
OF AFFECTION, HELD OUT HER HAND TO HIM.  HE APPROACHED,
AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF RATHER TO ELINOR THAN MARIANNE,
AS IF WISHING TO AVOID HER EYE, AND DETERMINED NOT TO
OBSERVE HER ATTITUDE, INQUIRED IN A HURRIED MANNER AFTER
MRS. DASHWOOD, AND ASKED HOW LONG THEY HAD BEEN IN TOWN.
ELINOR WAS ROBBED OF ALL PRESENCE OF MIND BY SUCH AN ADDRESS,
AND WAS UNABLE TO SAY A WORD.  BUT THE FEELINGS OF HER SISTER
WERE INSTANTLY EXPRESSED.  HER FACE WAS CRIMSONED OVER,
AND SHE EXCLAIMED, IN A VOICE OF THE GREATEST EMOTION,
"GOOD GOD! WILLOUGHBY, WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?
HAVE YOU NOT RECEIVED MY LETTERS?  WILL YOU NOT SHAKE
HANDS WITH ME?"

HE COULD NOT THEN AVOID IT, BUT HER TOUCH SEEMED
PAINFUL TO HIM, AND HE HELD HER HAND ONLY FOR A MOMENT.
DURING ALL THIS TIME HE WAS EVIDENTLY STRUGGLING FOR COMPOSURE.
ELINOR WATCHED HIS COUNTENANCE AND SAW ITS EXPRESSION
BECOMING MORE TRANQUIL.  AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE, HE SPOKE
WITH CALMNESS.

"I DID MYSELF THE HONOUR OF CALLING IN BERKELEY
STREET LAST TUESDAY, AND VERY MUCH REGRETTED THAT I WAS
NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND YOURSELVES AND MRS. JENNINGS
AT HOME.  MY CARD WAS NOT LOST, I HOPE."

"BUT HAVE YOU NOT RECEIVED MY NOTES?" CRIED MARIANNE
IN THE WILDEST ANXIETY.  "HERE IS SOME MISTAKE I AM
SURE--SOME DREADFUL MISTAKE.  WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING
OF IT?  TELL ME, WILLOUGHBY; FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TELL ME,
WHAT IS THE MATTER?"

HE MADE NO REPLY; HIS COMPLEXION CHANGED AND ALL HIS
EMBARRASSMENT RETURNED; BUT AS IF, ON CATCHING THE EYE
OF THE YOUNG LADY WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY TALKING,
HE FELT THE NECESSITY OF INSTANT EXERTION, HE RECOVERED
HIMSELF AGAIN, AND AFTER SAYING, "YES, I HAD THE PLEASURE
OF RECEIVING THE INFORMATION OF YOUR ARRIVAL IN TOWN,
WHICH YOU WERE SO GOOD AS TO SEND ME," TURNED HASTILY AWAY
WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND JOINED HIS FRIEND.

MARIANNE, NOW LOOKING DREADFULLY WHITE, AND UNABLE
TO STAND, SUNK INTO HER CHAIR, AND ELINOR, EXPECTING EVERY
MOMENT TO SEE HER FAINT, TRIED TO SCREEN HER FROM THE
OBSERVATION OF OTHERS, WHILE REVIVING HER WITH LAVENDER WATER.

"GO TO HIM, ELINOR," SHE CRIED, AS SOON AS SHE
COULD SPEAK, "AND FORCE HIM TO COME TO ME.  TELL HIM
I MUST SEE HIM AGAIN--MUST SPEAK TO HIM INSTANTLY.--
I CANNOT REST--I SHALL NOT HAVE A MOMENT'S PEACE TILL THIS
IS EXPLAINED--SOME DREADFUL MISAPPREHENSION OR OTHER.--
OH GO TO HIM THIS MOMENT."

"HOW CAN THAT BE DONE? NO, MY DEAREST MARIANNE,
YOU MUST WAIT.  THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR EXPLANATIONS.
WAIT ONLY TILL TOMORROW."

WITH DIFFICULTY HOWEVER COULD SHE PREVENT HER
FROM FOLLOWING HIM HERSELF; AND TO PERSUADE HER TO CHECK
HER AGITATION, TO WAIT, AT LEAST, WITH THE APPEARANCE
OF COMPOSURE, TILL SHE MIGHT SPEAK TO HIM WITH MORE PRIVACY
AND MORE EFFECT, WAS IMPOSSIBLE; FOR MARIANNE CONTINUED
INCESSANTLY TO GIVE WAY IN A LOW VOICE TO THE MISERY
OF HER FEELINGS, BY EXCLAMATIONS OF WRETCHEDNESS.
IN A SHORT TIME ELINOR SAW WILLOUGHBY QUIT THE ROOM BY THE
DOOR TOWARDS THE STAIRCASE, AND TELLING MARIANNE THAT HE
WAS GONE, URGED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SPEAKING TO HIM AGAIN
THAT EVENING, AS A FRESH ARGUMENT FOR HER TO BE CALM.
SHE INSTANTLY BEGGED HER SISTER WOULD ENTREAT LADY
MIDDLETON TO TAKE THEM HOME, AS SHE WAS TOO MISERABLE
TO STAY A MINUTE LONGER.

LADY MIDDLETON, THOUGH IN THE MIDDLE OF A RUBBER,
ON BEING INFORMED THAT MARIANNE WAS UNWELL, WAS TOO
POLITE TO OBJECT FOR A MOMENT TO HER WISH OF GOING AWAY,
AND MAKING OVER HER CARDS TO A FRIEND, THEY DEPARTED
AS SOON THE CARRIAGE COULD BE FOUND.  SCARCELY A WORD
WAS SPOKEN DURING THEIR RETURN TO BERKELEY STREET.
MARIANNE WAS IN A SILENT AGONY, TOO MUCH OPPRESSED EVEN
FOR TEARS; BUT AS MRS. JENNINGS WAS LUCKILY NOT COME HOME,
THEY COULD GO DIRECTLY TO THEIR OWN ROOM, WHERE HARTSHORN
RESTORED HER A LITTLE TO HERSELF.  SHE WAS SOON UNDRESSED
AND IN BED, AND AS SHE SEEMED DESIROUS OF BEING ALONE,
HER SISTER THEN LEFT HER, AND WHILE SHE WAITED THE RETURN
OF MRS. JENNINGS, HAD LEISURE ENOUGH FOR THINKING OVER
THE PAST.

THAT SOME KIND OF ENGAGEMENT HAD SUBSISTED
BETWEEN WILLOUGHBY AND MARIANNE SHE COULD NOT DOUBT,
AND THAT WILLOUGHBY WAS WEARY OF IT, SEEMED EQUALLY CLEAR;
FOR HOWEVER MARIANNE MIGHT STILL FEED HER OWN WISHES,
SHE COULD NOT ATTRIBUTE SUCH BEHAVIOUR TO MISTAKE
OR MISAPPREHENSION OF ANY KIND.  NOTHING BUT A THOROUGH
CHANGE OF SENTIMENT COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT.  HER INDIGNATION
WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL STRONGER THAN IT WAS, HAD SHE
NOT WITNESSED THAT EMBARRASSMENT WHICH SEEMED TO SPEAK
A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN MISCONDUCT, AND PREVENTED
HER FROM BELIEVING HIM SO UNPRINCIPLED AS TO HAVE BEEN
SPORTING WITH THE AFFECTIONS OF HER SISTER FROM THE FIRST,
WITHOUT ANY DESIGN THAT WOULD BEAR INVESTIGATION.
ABSENCE MIGHT HAVE WEAKENED HIS REGARD, AND CONVENIENCE
MIGHT HAVE DETERMINED HIM TO OVERCOME IT, BUT THAT SUCH
A REGARD HAD FORMERLY EXISTED SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF
TO DOUBT.

AS FOR MARIANNE, ON THE PANGS WHICH SO UNHAPPY A MEETING
MUST ALREADY HAVE GIVEN HER, AND ON THOSE STILL MORE
SEVERE WHICH MIGHT AWAIT HER IN ITS PROBABLE CONSEQUENCE,
SHE COULD NOT REFLECT WITHOUT THE DEEPEST CONCERN.
HER OWN SITUATION GAINED IN THE COMPARISON; FOR WHILE SHE
COULD ESTEEM EDWARD AS MUCH AS EVER, HOWEVER THEY MIGHT BE
DIVIDED IN FUTURE, HER MIND MIGHT BE ALWAYS SUPPORTED.
BUT EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT COULD EMBITTER SUCH AN EVIL
SEEMED UNITING TO HEIGHTEN THE MISERY OF MARIANNE
IN A FINAL SEPARATION FROM WILLOUGHBY--IN AN IMMEDIATE
AND IRRECONCILABLE RUPTURE WITH HIM.



CHAPTER 29


BEFORE THE HOUSE-MAID HAD LIT THEIR FIRE THE NEXT DAY,
OR THE SUN GAINED ANY POWER OVER A COLD, GLOOMY MORNING
IN JANUARY, MARIANNE, ONLY HALF DRESSED, WAS KNEELING
AGAINST ONE OF THE WINDOW-SEATS FOR THE SAKE OF ALL
THE LITTLE LIGHT SHE COULD COMMAND FROM IT, AND WRITING
AS FAST AS A CONTINUAL FLOW OF TEARS WOULD PERMIT HER.
IN THIS SITUATION, ELINOR, ROUSED FROM SLEEP BY HER AGITATION
AND SOBS, FIRST PERCEIVED HER; AND AFTER OBSERVING HER
FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITH SILENT ANXIETY, SAID, IN A TONE
OF THE MOST CONSIDERATE GENTLENESS,

"MARIANNE, MAY I ASK-?"

"NO, ELINOR," SHE REPLIED, "ASK NOTHING; YOU WILL
SOON KNOW ALL."

THE SORT OF DESPERATE CALMNESS WITH WHICH THIS WAS SAID,
LASTED NO LONGER THAN WHILE SHE SPOKE, AND WAS IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWED BY A RETURN OF THE SAME EXCESSIVE AFFLICTION.
IT WAS SOME MINUTES BEFORE SHE COULD GO ON WITH HER LETTER,
AND THE FREQUENT BURSTS OF GRIEF WHICH STILL OBLIGED HER,
AT INTERVALS, TO WITHHOLD HER PEN, WERE PROOFS ENOUGH OF HER
FEELING HOW MORE THAN PROBABLE IT WAS THAT SHE WAS WRITING
FOR THE LAST TIME TO WILLOUGHBY.

ELINOR PAID HER EVERY QUIET AND UNOBTRUSIVE ATTENTION
IN HER POWER; AND SHE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO SOOTH AND
TRANQUILIZE HER STILL MORE, HAD NOT MARIANNE ENTREATED HER,
WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS OF THE MOST NERVOUS IRRITABILITY,
NOT TO SPEAK TO HER FOR THE WORLD.  IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES,
IT WAS BETTER FOR BOTH THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE LONG TOGETHER;
AND THE RESTLESS STATE OF MARIANNE'S MIND NOT ONLY PREVENTED
HER FROM REMAINING IN THE ROOM A MOMENT AFTER SHE WAS DRESSED,
BUT REQUIRING AT ONCE SOLITUDE AND CONTINUAL CHANGE OF PLACE,
MADE HER WANDER ABOUT THE HOUSE TILL BREAKFAST TIME, AVOIDING
THE SIGHT OF EVERY BODY.

AT BREAKFAST SHE NEITHER ATE, NOR ATTEMPTED TO EAT
ANY THING; AND ELINOR'S ATTENTION WAS THEN ALL EMPLOYED,
NOT IN URGING HER, NOT IN PITYING HER, NOR IN APPEARING
TO REGARD HER, BUT IN ENDEAVOURING TO ENGAGE MRS. JENNING'S
NOTICE ENTIRELY TO HERSELF.

AS THIS WAS A FAVOURITE MEAL WITH MRS. JENNINGS,
IT LASTED A CONSIDERABLE TIME, AND THEY WERE JUST SETTING
THEMSELVES, AFTER IT, ROUND THE COMMON WORKING TABLE, WHEN A
LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO MARIANNE, WHICH SHE EAGERLY CAUGHT
FROM THE SERVANT, AND, TURNING OF A DEATH-LIKE PALENESS,
INSTANTLY RAN OUT OF THE ROOM.  ELINOR, WHO SAW AS PLAINLY
BY THIS, AS IF SHE HAD SEEN THE DIRECTION, THAT IT MUST
COME FROM WILLOUGHBY, FELT IMMEDIATELY SUCH A SICKNESS
AT HEART AS MADE HER HARDLY ABLE TO HOLD UP HER HEAD,
AND SAT IN SUCH A GENERAL TREMOUR AS MADE HER FEAR IT
IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE MRS. JENNING'S NOTICE.  THAT GOOD LADY,
HOWEVER, SAW ONLY THAT MARIANNE HAD RECEIVED A LETTER
FROM WILLOUGHBY, WHICH APPEARED TO HER A VERY GOOD JOKE,
AND WHICH SHE TREATED ACCORDINGLY, BY HOPING, WITH A LAUGH,
THAT SHE WOULD FIND IT TO HER LIKING.  OF ELINOR'S DISTRESS,
SHE WAS TOO BUSILY EMPLOYED IN MEASURING LENGTHS OF WORSTED
FOR HER RUG, TO SEE ANY THING AT ALL; AND CALMLY CONTINUING
HER TALK, AS SOON AS MARIANNE DISAPPEARED, SHE SAID,

"UPON MY WORD, I NEVER SAW A YOUNG WOMAN SO
DESPERATELY IN LOVE IN MY LIFE!  MY GIRLS WERE NOTHING
TO HER, AND YET THEY USED TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH; BUT AS
FOR MISS MARIANNE, SHE IS QUITE AN ALTERED CREATURE.
I HOPE, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, HE WON'T KEEP HER
WAITING MUCH LONGER, FOR IT IS QUITE GRIEVOUS TO SEE HER
LOOK SO ILL AND FORLORN.  PRAY, WHEN ARE THEY TO BE MARRIED?"

ELINOR, THOUGH NEVER LESS DISPOSED TO SPEAK THAN AT
THAT MOMENT, OBLIGED HERSELF TO ANSWER SUCH AN ATTACK
AS THIS, AND, THEREFORE, TRYING TO SMILE, REPLIED, "AND HAVE
YOU REALLY, MA'AM, TALKED YOURSELF INTO A PERSUASION
OF MY SISTER'S BEING ENGAGED TO MR. WILLOUGHBY?  I THOUGHT
IT HAD BEEN ONLY A JOKE, BUT SO SERIOUS A QUESTION SEEMS
TO IMPLY MORE; AND I MUST BEG, THEREFORE, THAT YOU WILL NOT
DECEIVE YOURSELF ANY LONGER.  I DO ASSURE YOU THAT NOTHING
WOULD SURPRISE ME MORE THAN TO HEAR OF THEIR BEING GOING
TO BE MARRIED."

"FOR SHAME, FOR SHAME, MISS DASHWOOD! HOW CAN YOU
TALK SO?  DON'T WE ALL KNOW THAT IT MUST BE A MATCH, THAT
THEY WERE OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER FROM
THE FIRST MOMENT THEY MET?  DID NOT I SEE THEM TOGETHER
IN DEVONSHIRE EVERY DAY, AND ALL DAY LONG; AND DID NOT I
KNOW THAT YOUR SISTER CAME TO TOWN WITH ME ON PURPOSE
TO BUY WEDDING CLOTHES?  COME, COME, THIS WON'T DO.
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO SLY ABOUT IT YOURSELF, YOU THINK NOBODY
ELSE HAS ANY SENSES; BUT IT IS NO SUCH THING, I CAN TELL YOU,
FOR IT HAS BEEN KNOWN ALL OVER TOWN THIS EVER SO LONG.
I TELL EVERY BODY OF IT AND SO DOES CHARLOTTE."

"INDEED, MA'AM," SAID ELINOR, VERY SERIOUSLY,
"YOU ARE MISTAKEN.  INDEED, YOU ARE DOING A VERY UNKIND THING
IN SPREADING THE REPORT, AND YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU HAVE
THOUGH YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE ME NOW."

MRS. JENNINGS LAUGHED AGAIN, BUT ELINOR HAD NOT
SPIRITS TO SAY MORE, AND EAGER AT ALL EVENTS TO KNOW
WHAT WILLOUGHBY HAD WRITTEN, HURRIED AWAY TO THEIR ROOM,
WHERE, ON OPENING THE DOOR, SHE SAW MARIANNE STRETCHED ON
THE BED, ALMOST CHOKED BY GRIEF, ONE LETTER IN HER HAND,
AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS LAYING BY HER.  ELINOR DREW NEAR,
BUT WITHOUT SAYING A WORD; AND SEATING HERSELF ON THE BED,
TOOK HER HAND, KISSED HER AFFECTIONATELY SEVERAL TIMES,
AND THEN GAVE WAY TO A BURST OF TEARS, WHICH AT FIRST
WAS SCARCELY LESS VIOLENT THAN MARIANNE'S. THE LATTER,
THOUGH UNABLE TO SPEAK, SEEMED TO FEEL ALL THE TENDERNESS
OF THIS BEHAVIOUR, AND AFTER SOME TIME THUS SPENT IN
JOINT AFFLICTION, SHE PUT ALL THE LETTERS INTO ELINOR'S HANDS;
AND THEN COVERING HER FACE WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF,
ALMOST SCREAMED WITH AGONY.  ELINOR, WHO KNEW THAT SUCH GRIEF,
SHOCKING AS IT WAS TO WITNESS IT, MUST HAVE ITS COURSE,
WATCHED BY HER TILL THIS EXCESS OF SUFFERING HAD SOMEWHAT
SPENT ITSELF, AND THEN TURNING EAGERLY TO WILLOUGHBY'S LETTER,
READ AS FOLLOWS:

                              "BOND STREET, JANUARY.
     "MY DEAR MADAM,

     "I HAVE JUST HAD THE HONOUR OF RECEIVING YOUR
     LETTER, FOR WHICH I BEG TO RETURN MY SINCERE
     ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.  I AM MUCH CONCERNED TO FIND THERE
     WAS ANYTHING IN MY BEHAVIOUR LAST NIGHT THAT DID
     NOT MEET YOUR APPROBATION; AND THOUGH I AM QUITE AT
     A LOSS TO DISCOVER IN WHAT POINT I COULD BE SO
     UNFORTUNATE AS TO OFFEND YOU, I ENTREAT YOUR
     FORGIVENESS OF WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU TO HAVE BEEN
     PERFECTLY UNINTENTIONAL.  I SHALL NEVER REFLECT ON
     MY FORMER ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR FAMILY IN DEVONSHIRE
     WITHOUT THE MOST GRATEFUL PLEASURE, AND FLATTER
     MYSELF IT WILL NOT BE BROKEN BY ANY MISTAKE OR
     MISAPPREHENSION OF MY ACTIONS.  MY ESTEEM FOR YOUR
     WHOLE FAMILY IS VERY SINCERE; BUT IF I HAVE BEEN SO
     UNFORTUNATE AS TO GIVE RISE TO A BELIEF OF MORE THAN
     I FELT, OR MEANT TO EXPRESS, I SHALL REPROACH MYSELF
     FOR NOT HAVING BEEN MORE GUARDED IN MY PROFESSIONS
     OF THAT ESTEEM.  THAT I SHOULD EVER HAVE MEANT MORE
     YOU WILL ALLOW TO BE IMPOSSIBLE, WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND
     THAT MY AFFECTIONS HAVE BEEN LONG ENGAGED ELSEWHERE,
     AND IT WILL NOT BE MANY WEEKS, I BELIEVE, BEFORE
     THIS ENGAGEMENT IS FULFILLED.  IT IS WITH GREAT
     REGRET THAT I OBEY YOUR COMMANDS IN RETURNING THE
     LETTERS WITH WHICH I HAVE BEEN HONOURED FROM YOU,
     AND THE LOCK OF HAIR, WHICH YOU SO OBLIGINGLY BESTOWED
     ON ME.

     "I AM, DEAR MADAM,
               "YOUR MOST OBEDIENT
                    "HUMBLE SERVANT,
                                        "JOHN WILLOUGHBY."


WITH WHAT INDIGNATION SUCH A LETTER AS THIS MUST
BE READ BY MISS DASHWOOD, MAY BE IMAGINED.  THOUGH AWARE,
BEFORE SHE BEGAN IT, THAT IT MUST BRING A CONFESSION
OF HIS INCONSTANCY, AND CONFIRM THEIR SEPARATION FOR EVER,
SHE WAS NOT AWARE THAT SUCH LANGUAGE COULD BE SUFFERED
TO ANNOUNCE IT; NOR COULD SHE HAVE SUPPOSED WILLOUGHBY
CAPABLE OF DEPARTING SO FAR FROM THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY
HONOURABLE AND DELICATE FEELING--SO FAR FROM THE COMMON
DECORUM OF A GENTLEMAN, AS TO SEND A LETTER SO IMPUDENTLY
CRUEL: A LETTER WHICH, INSTEAD OF BRINGING WITH HIS DESIRE
OF A RELEASE ANY PROFESSIONS OF REGRET, ACKNOWLEDGED NO
BREACH OF FAITH, DENIED ALL PECULIAR AFFECTION WHATEVER--
A LETTER OF WHICH EVERY LINE WAS AN INSULT, AND WHICH
PROCLAIMED ITS WRITER TO BE DEEP IN HARDENED VILLAINY.

SHE PAUSED OVER IT FOR SOME TIME WITH INDIGNANT
ASTONISHMENT; THEN READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN; BUT EVERY
PERUSAL ONLY SERVED TO INCREASE HER ABHORRENCE OF THE MAN,
AND SO BITTER WERE HER FEELINGS AGAINST HIM, THAT SHE
DARED NOT TRUST HERSELF TO SPEAK, LEST SHE MIGHT WOUND
MARIANNE STILL DEEPER BY TREATING THEIR DISENGAGEMENT,
NOT AS A LOSS TO HER OF ANY POSSIBLE GOOD BUT AS AN
ESCAPE FROM THE WORST AND MOST IRREMEDIABLE OF ALL
EVILS, A CONNECTION, FOR LIFE, WITH AN UNPRINCIPLED MAN,
AS A DELIVERANCE THE MOST REAL, A BLESSING THE MOST IMPORTANT.

IN HER EARNEST MEDITATIONS ON THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER,
ON THE DEPRAVITY OF THAT MIND WHICH COULD DICTATE IT,
AND PROBABLY, ON THE VERY DIFFERENT MIND OF A VERY DIFFERENT
PERSON, WHO HAD NO OTHER CONNECTION WHATEVER WITH THE AFFAIR
THAN WHAT HER HEART GAVE HIM WITH EVERY THING THAT PASSED,
ELINOR FORGOT THE IMMEDIATE DISTRESS OF HER SISTER,
FORGOT THAT SHE HAD THREE LETTERS ON HER LAP YET UNREAD,
AND SO ENTIRELY FORGOT HOW LONG SHE HAD BEEN IN THE ROOM,
THAT WHEN ON HEARING A CARRIAGE DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR,
SHE WENT TO THE WINDOW TO SEE WHO COULD BE COMING SO
UNREASONABLY EARLY, SHE WAS ALL ASTONISHMENT TO PERCEIVE
MRS. JENNINGS'S CHARIOT, WHICH SHE KNEW HAD NOT BEEN
ORDERED TILL ONE.  DETERMINED NOT TO QUIT MARIANNE,
THOUGH HOPELESS OF CONTRIBUTING, AT PRESENT, TO HER EASE,
SHE HURRIED AWAY TO EXCUSE HERSELF FROM ATTENDING
MRS. JENNINGS, ON ACCOUNT OF HER SISTER BEING INDISPOSED.
MRS. JENNINGS, WITH A THOROUGHLY GOOD-HUMOURED CONCERN
FOR ITS CAUSE, ADMITTED THE EXCUSE MOST READILY, AND ELINOR,
AFTER SEEING HER SAFE OFF, RETURNED TO MARIANNE, WHOM SHE
FOUND ATTEMPTING TO RISE FROM THE BED, AND WHOM SHE REACHED
JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT HER FROM FALLING ON THE FLOOR,
FAINT AND GIDDY FROM A LONG WANT OF PROPER REST AND FOOD;
FOR IT WAS MANY DAYS SINCE SHE HAD ANY APPETITE, AND MANY
NIGHTS SINCE SHE HAD REALLY SLEPT; AND NOW, WHEN HER
MIND WAS NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY THE FEVER OF SUSPENSE,
THE CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THIS WAS FELT IN AN ACHING HEAD,
A WEAKENED STOMACH, AND A GENERAL NERVOUS FAINTNESS.
A GLASS OF WINE, WHICH ELINOR PROCURED FOR HER DIRECTLY,
MADE HER MORE COMFORTABLE, AND SHE WAS AT LAST ABLE TO EXPRESS
SOME SENSE OF HER KINDNESS, BY SAYING,

"POOR ELINOR! HOW UNHAPPY I MAKE YOU!"

"I ONLY WISH," REPLIED HER SISTER, "THERE WERE
ANY THING I COULD DO, WHICH MIGHT BE OF COMFORT TO YOU."

THIS, AS EVERY THING ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN,
WAS TOO MUCH FOR MARIANNE, WHO COULD ONLY EXCLAIM,
IN THE ANGUISH OF HER HEART, "OH! ELINOR, I AM MISERABLE,
INDEED," BEFORE HER VOICE WAS ENTIRELY LOST IN SOBS.

ELINOR COULD NO LONGER WITNESS THIS TORRENT
OF UNRESISTED GRIEF IN SILENCE.

"EXERT YOURSELF, DEAR MARIANNE," SHE CRIED,
"IF YOU WOULD NOT KILL YOURSELF AND ALL WHO LOVE YOU.
THINK OF YOUR MOTHER; THINK OF HER MISERY WHILE YOU SUFFER:
FOR HER SAKE YOU MUST EXERT YOURSELF."

"I CANNOT, I CANNOT," CRIED MARIANNE; "LEAVE ME,
LEAVE ME, IF I DISTRESS YOU; LEAVE ME, HATE ME, FORGET ME!
BUT DO NOT TORTURE ME SO.  OH! HOW EASY FOR THOSE,
WHO HAVE NO SORROW OF THEIR OWN TO TALK OF EXERTION!  HAPPY,
HAPPY ELINOR, YOU CANNOT HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT I SUFFER."

"DO YOU CALL ME HAPPY, MARIANNE?  AH! IF YOU KNEW!--AND
CAN YOU BELIEVE ME TO BE SO, WHILE I SEE YOU SO WRETCHED!"

"FORGIVE ME, FORGIVE ME," THROWING HER ARMS ROUND
HER SISTER'S NECK; "I KNOW YOU FEEL FOR ME; I KNOW WHAT
A HEART YOU HAVE; BUT YET YOU ARE--YOU MUST BE HAPPY;
EDWARD LOVES YOU--WHAT, OH WHAT, CAN DO AWAY SUCH HAPPINESS
AS THAT?"

"MANY, MANY CIRCUMSTANCES," SAID ELINOR, SOLEMNLY.

"NO, NO, NO," CRIED MARIANNE WILDLY, "HE LOVES YOU,
AND ONLY YOU.  YOU CAN HAVE NO GRIEF."

"I CAN HAVE NO PLEASURE WHILE I SEE YOU IN THIS STATE."

"AND YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME OTHERWISE.  MINE IS
A MISERY WHICH NOTHING CAN DO AWAY."

"YOU MUST NOT TALK SO, MARIANNE.  HAVE YOU NO
COMFORTS? NO FRIENDS?  IS YOUR LOSS SUCH AS LEAVES
NO OPENING FOR CONSOLATION?  MUCH AS YOU SUFFER NOW,
THINK OF WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE SUFFERED IF THE DISCOVERY
OF HIS CHARACTER HAD BEEN DELAYED TO A LATER PERIOD--
IF YOUR ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN CARRIED ON FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS,
AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, BEFORE HE CHOSE TO PUT AN END TO IT.
EVERY ADDITIONAL DAY OF UNHAPPY CONFIDENCE, ON YOUR SIDE,
WOULD HAVE MADE THE BLOW MORE DREADFUL."

"ENGAGEMENT!" CRIED MARIANNE, "THERE HAS BEEN
NO ENGAGEMENT."

"NO ENGAGEMENT!"

"NO, HE IS NOT SO UNWORTHY AS YOU BELIEVE HIM.
HE HAS BROKEN NO FAITH WITH ME."

"BUT HE TOLD YOU THAT HE LOVED YOU."

"YES--NO--NEVER ABSOLUTELY.  IT WAS EVERY DAY IMPLIED,
BUT NEVER PROFESSEDLY DECLARED.  SOMETIMES I THOUGHT IT
HAD BEEN--BUT IT NEVER WAS."

"YET YOU WROTE TO HIM?"--

"YES--COULD THAT BE WRONG AFTER ALL THAT HAD PASSED?--
BUT I CANNOT TALK."

ELINOR SAID NO MORE, AND TURNING AGAIN TO THE THREE
LETTERS WHICH NOW RAISED A MUCH STRONGER CURIOSITY
THAN BEFORE, DIRECTLY RAN OVER THE CONTENTS OF ALL.
THE FIRST, WHICH WAS WHAT HER SISTER HAD SENT HIM
ON THEIR ARRIVAL IN TOWN, WAS TO THIS EFFECT.

                         BERKELEY STREET, JANUARY.

     "HOW SURPRISED YOU WILL BE, WILLOUGHBY, ON
     RECEIVING THIS; AND I THINK YOU WILL FEEL SOMETHING
     MORE THAN SURPRISE, WHEN YOU KNOW THAT I AM IN TOWN.
     AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMING HITHER, THOUGH WITH MRS.
     JENNINGS, WAS A TEMPTATION WE COULD NOT RESIST.
     I WISH YOU MAY RECEIVE THIS IN TIME TO COME HERE
     TO-NIGHT, BUT I WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT.  AT ANY RATE
     I SHALL EXPECT YOU TO-MORROW. FOR THE PRESENT, ADIEU.

                                             "M.D."

HER SECOND NOTE, WHICH HAD BEEN WRITTEN ON THE MORNING
AFTER THE DANCE AT THE MIDDLETONS', WAS IN THESE WORDS:--

     "I CANNOT EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT IN HAVING
     MISSED YOU THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, NOR MY ASTONISHMENT
     AT NOT HAVING RECEIVED ANY ANSWER TO A NOTE WHICH
     I SENT YOU ABOVE A WEEK AGO.  I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING
     TO HEAR FROM YOU, AND STILL MORE TO SEE YOU, EVERY
     HOUR OF THE DAY.  PRAY CALL AGAIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
     AND EXPLAIN THE REASON OF MY HAVING EXPECTED THIS
     IN VAIN.  YOU HAD BETTER COME EARLIER ANOTHER TIME,
     BECAUSE WE ARE GENERALLY OUT BY ONE.  WE WERE LAST
     NIGHT AT LADY MIDDLETON'S, WHERE THERE WAS A DANCE.
     I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT YOU WERE ASKED TO BE OF THE
     PARTY.  BUT COULD IT BE SO?  YOU MUST BE VERY MUCH
     ALTERED INDEED SINCE WE PARTED, IF THAT COULD BE
     THE CASE, AND YOU NOT THERE.  BUT I WILL NOT SUPPOSE
     THIS POSSIBLE, AND I HOPE VERY SOON TO RECEIVE YOUR
     PERSONAL ASSURANCE OF ITS BEING OTHERWISE.

                                            "M.D."

THE CONTENTS OF HER LAST NOTE TO HIM WERE THESE:--

     "WHAT AM I TO IMAGINE, WILLOUGHBY, BY YOUR
     BEHAVIOUR LAST NIGHT?  AGAIN I DEMAND AN EXPLANATION
     OF IT.  I WAS PREPARED TO MEET YOU WITH THE PLEASURE
     WHICH OUR SEPARATION NATURALLY PRODUCED, WITH THE
     FAMILIARITY WHICH OUR INTIMACY AT BARTON APPEARED
     TO ME TO JUSTIFY.  I WAS REPULSED INDEED! I HAVE
     PASSED A WRETCHED NIGHT IN ENDEAVOURING TO EXCUSE
     A CONDUCT WHICH CAN SCARCELY BE CALLED LESS THAN
     INSULTING; BUT THOUGH I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO
     FORM ANY REASONABLE APOLOGY FOR YOUR BEHAVIOUR,
     I AM PERFECTLY READY TO HEAR YOUR JUSTIFICATION OF
     IT.  YOU HAVE PERHAPS BEEN MISINFORMED, OR PURPOSELY
     DECEIVED, IN SOMETHING CONCERNING ME, WHICH MAY HAVE
     LOWERED ME IN YOUR OPINION.  TELL ME WHAT IT IS,
     EXPLAIN THE GROUNDS ON WHICH YOU ACTED, AND I SHALL
     BE SATISFIED, IN BEING ABLE TO SATISFY YOU.  IT
     WOULD GRIEVE ME INDEED TO BE OBLIGED TO THINK ILL
     OF YOU; BUT IF I AM TO DO IT, IF I AM TO LEARN THAT
     YOU ARE NOT WHAT WE HAVE HITHERTO BELIEVED YOU, THAT
     YOUR REGARD FOR US ALL WAS INSINCERE, THAT YOUR
     BEHAVIOUR TO ME WAS INTENDED ONLY TO DECEIVE, LET
     IT BE TOLD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  MY FEELINGS ARE AT
     PRESENT IN A STATE OF DREADFUL INDECISION; I WISH
     TO ACQUIT YOU, BUT CERTAINTY ON EITHER SIDE WILL BE
     EASE TO WHAT I NOW SUFFER.  IF YOUR SENTIMENTS ARE
     NO LONGER WHAT THEY WERE, YOU WILL RETURN MY NOTES,
     AND THE LOCK OF MY HAIR WHICH IS IN YOUR POSSESSION.

                                             "M.D."

THAT SUCH LETTERS, SO FULL OF AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE,
COULD HAVE BEEN SO ANSWERED, ELINOR, FOR WILLOUGHBY'S SAKE,
WOULD HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO BELIEVE.  BUT HER CONDEMNATION
OF HIM DID NOT BLIND HER TO THE IMPROPRIETY OF THEIR
HAVING BEEN WRITTEN AT ALL; AND SHE WAS SILENTLY GRIEVING
OVER THE IMPRUDENCE WHICH HAD HAZARDED SUCH UNSOLICITED
PROOFS OF TENDERNESS, NOT WARRANTED BY ANYTHING PRECEDING,
AND MOST SEVERELY CONDEMNED BY THE EVENT, WHEN MARIANNE,
PERCEIVING THAT SHE HAD FINISHED THE LETTERS, OBSERVED TO
HER THAT THEY CONTAINED NOTHING BUT WHAT ANY ONE WOULD
HAVE WRITTEN IN THE SAME SITUATION.

"I FELT MYSELF," SHE ADDED, "TO BE AS SOLEMNLY
ENGAGED TO HIM, AS IF THE STRICTEST LEGAL COVENANT
HAD BOUND US TO EACH OTHER."

"I CAN BELIEVE IT," SAID ELINOR; "BUT UNFORTUNATELY
HE DID NOT FEEL THE SAME."

"HE DID FEEL THE SAME, ELINOR--FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS HE
FELT IT.  I KNOW HE DID.  WHATEVER MAY HAVE CHANGED HIM NOW, (AND
NOTHING BUT THE BLACKEST ART EMPLOYED AGAINST ME CAN HAVE DONE
IT), I WAS ONCE AS DEAR TO HIM AS MY OWN SOUL COULD WISH.
THIS LOCK OF HAIR, WHICH NOW HE CAN SO READILY GIVE UP,
WAS BEGGED OF ME WITH THE MOST EARNEST SUPPLICATION.
HAD YOU SEEN HIS LOOK, HIS MANNER, HAD YOU HEARD HIS VOICE
AT THAT MOMENT!  HAVE YOU FORGOT THE LAST EVENING OF OUR
BEING TOGETHER AT BARTON?  THE MORNING THAT WE PARTED
TOO!  WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT IT MIGHT BE MANY WEEKS BEFORE
WE MET AGAIN--HIS DISTRESS--CAN I EVER FORGET HIS DISTRESS?"

FOR A MOMENT OR TWO SHE COULD SAY NO MORE;
BUT WHEN THIS EMOTION HAD PASSED AWAY, SHE ADDED,
IN A FIRMER TONE,

"ELINOR, I HAVE BEEN CRUELLY USED; BUT NOT BY WILLOUGHBY."

"DEAREST MARIANNE, WHO BUT HIMSELF?  BY WHOM CAN HE
HAVE BEEN INSTIGATED?"

"BY ALL THE WORLD, RATHER THAN BY HIS OWN HEART.
I COULD RATHER BELIEVE EVERY CREATURE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE
LEAGUED TOGETHER TO RUIN ME IN HIS OPINION, THAN BELIEVE
HIS NATURE CAPABLE OF SUCH CRUELTY.  THIS WOMAN OF WHOM HE
WRITES--WHOEVER SHE BE--OR ANY ONE, IN SHORT, BUT YOUR OWN
DEAR SELF, MAMA, AND EDWARD, MAY HAVE BEEN SO BARBAROUS
TO BELY ME.  BEYOND YOU THREE, IS THERE A CREATURE
IN THE WORLD WHOM I WOULD NOT RATHER SUSPECT OF EVIL
THAN WILLOUGHBY, WHOSE HEART I KNOW SO WELL?"

ELINOR WOULD NOT CONTEND, AND ONLY REPLIED,
"WHOEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SO DETESTABLY YOUR ENEMY, LET THEM
BE CHEATED OF THEIR MALIGNANT TRIUMPH, MY DEAR SISTER,
BY SEEING HOW NOBLY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF YOUR OWN
INNOCENCE AND GOOD INTENTIONS SUPPORTS YOUR SPIRITS.
IT IS A REASONABLE AND LAUDABLE PRIDE WHICH RESISTS
SUCH MALEVOLENCE."

"NO, NO," CRIED MARIANNE, "MISERY SUCH AS MINE HAS
NO PRIDE.  I CARE NOT WHO KNOWS THAT I AM WRETCHED.
THE TRIUMPH OF SEEING ME SO MAY BE OPEN TO ALL THE WORLD.
ELINOR, ELINOR, THEY WHO SUFFER LITTLE MAY BE PROUD AND
INDEPENDENT AS THEY LIKE--MAY RESIST INSULT, OR RETURN
MORTIFICATION--BUT I CANNOT.  I MUST FEEL--I MUST BE
WRETCHED--AND THEY ARE WELCOME TO ENJOY THE CONSCIOUSNESS
OF IT THAT CAN."

"BUT FOR MY MOTHER'S SAKE AND MINE--"

"I WOULD DO MORE THAN FOR MY OWN.  BUT TO APPEAR
HAPPY WHEN I AM SO MISERABLE--OH! WHO CAN REQUIRE IT?"

AGAIN THEY WERE BOTH SILENT.  ELINOR WAS EMPLOYED
IN WALKING THOUGHTFULLY FROM THE FIRE TO THE WINDOW,
FROM THE WINDOW TO THE FIRE, WITHOUT KNOWING THAT SHE
RECEIVED WARMTH FROM ONE, OR DISCERNING OBJECTS THROUGH
THE OTHER; AND MARIANNE, SEATED AT THE FOOT OF THE BED,
WITH HER HEAD LEANING AGAINST ONE OF ITS POSTS,
AGAIN TOOK UP WILLOUGHBY'S LETTER, AND, AFTER SHUDDERING
OVER EVERY SENTENCE, EXCLAIMED--

"IT IS TOO MUCH! OH, WILLOUGHBY, WILLOUGHBY, COULD THIS
BE YOURS!  CRUEL, CRUEL--NOTHING CAN ACQUIT YOU.  ELINOR,
NOTHING CAN.  WHATEVER HE MIGHT HAVE HEARD AGAINST ME--
OUGHT HE NOT TO HAVE SUSPENDED HIS BELIEF? OUGHT HE NOT TO
HAVE TOLD ME OF IT, TO HAVE GIVEN ME THE POWER OF CLEARING
MYSELF? 'THE LOCK OF HAIR, (REPEATING IT FROM THE LETTER,)
WHICH YOU SO OBLIGINGLY BESTOWED ON ME'--THAT IS UNPARDONABLE.
WILLOUGHBY, WHERE WAS YOUR HEART WHEN YOU WROTE THOSE WORDS?
OH, BARBAROUSLY INSOLENT!--ELINOR, CAN HE BE JUSTIFIED?"

"NO, MARIANNE, IN NO POSSIBLE WAY."

"AND YET THIS WOMAN--WHO KNOWS WHAT HER ART MAY
HAVE BEEN?--HOW LONG IT MAY HAVE BEEN PREMEDITATED,
AND HOW DEEPLY CONTRIVED BY HER!--WHO IS SHE?--WHO CAN
SHE BE?--WHOM DID I EVER HEAR HIM TALK OF AS YOUNG AND
ATTRACTIVE AMONG HIS FEMALE ACQUAINTANCE?--OH! NO ONE,
NO ONE--HE TALKED TO ME ONLY OF MYSELF."

ANOTHER PAUSE ENSUED; MARIANNE WAS GREATLY AGITATED,
AND IT ENDED THUS.

"ELINOR, I MUST GO HOME.  I MUST GO AND COMFORT MAMA.
CAN NOT WE BE GONE TO-MORROW?"

"TO-MORROW, MARIANNE!"

"YES, WHY SHOULD I STAY HERE? I CAME ONLY FOR
WILLOUGHBY'S SAKE--AND NOW WHO CARES FOR ME? WHO REGARDS ME?"

"IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GO TO-MORROW. WE OWE
MRS. JENNINGS MUCH MORE THAN CIVILITY; AND CIVILITY OF
THE COMMONEST KIND MUST PREVENT SUCH A HASTY REMOVAL AS THAT."

"WELL THEN, ANOTHER DAY OR TWO, PERHAPS; BUT I CANNOT
STAY HERE LONG, I CANNOT STAY TO ENDURE THE QUESTIONS
AND REMARKS OF ALL THESE PEOPLE.  THE MIDDLETONS AND
PALMERS--HOW AM I TO BEAR THEIR PITY?  THE PITY OF SUCH
A WOMAN AS LADY MIDDLETON!  OH, WHAT WOULD HE SAY TO THAT!"

ELINOR ADVISED HER TO LIE DOWN AGAIN, AND FOR A
MOMENT SHE DID SO; BUT NO ATTITUDE COULD GIVE HER EASE;
AND IN RESTLESS PAIN OF MIND AND BODY SHE MOVED FROM ONE
POSTURE TO ANOTHER, TILL GROWING MORE AND MORE HYSTERICAL,
HER SISTER COULD WITH DIFFICULTY KEEP HER ON THE BED AT ALL,
AND FOR SOME TIME WAS FEARFUL OF BEING CONSTRAINED TO CALL
FOR ASSISTANCE.  SOME LAVENDER DROPS, HOWEVER, WHICH SHE
WAS AT LENGTH PERSUADED TO TAKE, WERE OF USE; AND FROM
THAT TIME TILL MRS. JENNINGS RETURNED, SHE CONTINUED
ON THE BED QUIET AND MOTIONLESS.



CHAPTER 30


MRS. JENNINGS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO THEIR ROOM ON HER RETURN,
AND WITHOUT WAITING TO HAVE HER REQUEST OF ADMITTANCE ANSWERED,
OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED IN WITH A LOOK OF REAL CONCERN.

"HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR?"--SAID SHE IN A VOICE OF GREAT
COMPASSION TO MARIANNE, WHO TURNED AWAY HER FACE WITHOUT
ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER.

"HOW IS SHE, MISS DASHWOOD?--POOR THING! SHE LOOKS VERY BAD.--
NO WONDER.  AY, IT IS BUT TOO TRUE.  HE IS TO BE MARRIED
VERY SOON--A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING FELLOW!  I HAVE NO PATIENCE
WITH HIM.  MRS. TAYLOR TOLD ME OF IT HALF AN HOUR AGO,
AND SHE WAS TOLD IT BY A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MISS
GREY HERSELF, ELSE I AM SURE I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT;
AND I WAS ALMOST READY TO SINK AS IT WAS.  WELL, SAID I,
ALL I CAN SAY IS, THAT IF THIS BE TRUE, HE HAS USED
A YOUNG LADY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE ABOMINABLY ILL, AND I
WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL HIS WIFE MAY PLAGUE HIS HEART OUT.
AND SO I SHALL ALWAYS SAY, MY DEAR, YOU MAY DEPEND ON IT.
I HAVE NO NOTION OF MEN'S GOING ON IN THIS WAY; AND IF EVER
I MEET HIM AGAIN, I WILL GIVE HIM SUCH A DRESSING AS HE
HAS NOT HAD THIS MANY A DAY.  BUT THERE IS ONE COMFORT,
MY DEAR MISS MARIANNE; HE IS NOT THE ONLY YOUNG MAN
IN THE WORLD WORTH HAVING; AND WITH YOUR PRETTY FACE
YOU WILL NEVER WANT ADMIRERS.  WELL, POOR THING!  I WON'T
DISTURB HER ANY LONGER, FOR SHE HAD BETTER HAVE HER CRY
OUT AT ONCE AND HAVE DONE WITH.  THE PARRYS AND SANDERSONS
LUCKILY ARE COMING TONIGHT YOU KNOW, AND THAT WILL AMUSE HER."

SHE THEN WENT AWAY, WALKING ON TIPTOE OUT OF THE ROOM,
AS IF SHE SUPPOSED HER YOUNG FRIEND'S AFFLICTION COULD
BE INCREASED BY NOISE.

MARIANNE, TO THE SURPRISE OF HER SISTER,
DETERMINED ON DINING WITH THEM.  ELINOR EVEN ADVISED
HER AGAINST IT.  BUT "NO, SHE WOULD GO DOWN; SHE COULD
BEAR IT VERY WELL, AND THE BUSTLE ABOUT HER WOULD
BE LESS."  ELINOR, PLEASED TO HAVE HER GOVERNED FOR A
MOMENT BY SUCH A MOTIVE, THOUGH BELIEVING IT HARDLY
POSSIBLE THAT SHE COULD SIT OUT THE DINNER, SAID NO MORE;
AND ADJUSTING HER DRESS FOR HER AS WELL AS SHE COULD,
WHILE MARIANNE STILL REMAINED ON THE BED, WAS READY
TO ASSIST HER INTO THE DINING ROOM AS SOON AS THEY WERE
SUMMONED TO IT.

WHEN THERE, THOUGH LOOKING MOST WRETCHEDLY,
SHE ATE MORE AND WAS CALMER THAN HER SISTER HAD EXPECTED.
HAD SHE TRIED TO SPEAK, OR HAD SHE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF HALF
MRS. JENNINGS'S WELL-MEANT BUT ILL-JUDGED ATTENTIONS
TO HER, THIS CALMNESS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED;
BUT NOT A SYLLABLE ESCAPED HER LIPS; AND THE ABSTRACTION
OF HER THOUGHTS PRESERVED HER IN IGNORANCE OF EVERY THING
THAT WAS PASSING BEFORE HER.

ELINOR, WHO DID JUSTICE TO MRS. JENNINGS'S KINDNESS,
THOUGH ITS EFFUSIONS WERE OFTEN DISTRESSING, AND SOMETIMES
ALMOST RIDICULOUS, MADE HER THOSE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS,
AND RETURNED HER THOSE CIVILITIES, WHICH HER SISTER COULD
NOT MAKE OR RETURN FOR HERSELF.  THEIR GOOD FRIEND SAW
THAT MARIANNE WAS UNHAPPY, AND FELT THAT EVERY THING
WAS DUE TO HER WHICH MIGHT MAKE HER AT ALL LESS SO.
SHE TREATED HER THEREFORE, WITH ALL THE INDULGENT FONDNESS
OF A PARENT TOWARDS A FAVOURITE CHILD ON THE LAST DAY OF
ITS HOLIDAYS.  MARIANNE WAS TO HAVE THE BEST PLACE BY THE FIRE,
WAS TO BE TEMPTED TO EAT BY EVERY DELICACY IN THE HOUSE,
AND TO BE AMUSED BY THE RELATION OF ALL THE NEWS OF THE DAY.
HAD NOT ELINOR, IN THE SAD COUNTENANCE OF HER SISTER,
SEEN A CHECK TO ALL MIRTH, SHE COULD HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINED
BY MRS. JENNINGS'S ENDEAVOURS TO CURE A DISAPPOINTMENT IN LOVE,
BY A VARIETY OF SWEETMEATS AND OLIVES, AND A GOOD FIRE.
AS SOON, HOWEVER, AS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THIS WAS
FORCED BY CONTINUAL REPETITION ON MARIANNE, SHE COULD
STAY NO LONGER.  WITH A HASTY EXCLAMATION OF MISERY,
AND A SIGN TO HER SISTER NOT TO FOLLOW HER, SHE DIRECTLY GOT
UP AND HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM.

"POOR SOUL!" CRIED MRS. JENNINGS, AS SOON AS SHE WAS GONE,
"HOW IT GRIEVES ME TO SEE HER!  AND I DECLARE IF SHE IS
NOT GONE AWAY WITHOUT FINISHING HER WINE!  AND THE DRIED
CHERRIES TOO!  LORD! NOTHING SEEMS TO DO HER ANY GOOD.
I AM SURE IF I KNEW OF ANY THING SHE WOULD LIKE, I WOULD
SEND ALL OVER THE TOWN FOR IT.  WELL, IT IS THE ODDEST
THING TO ME, THAT A MAN SHOULD USE SUCH A PRETTY GIRL
SO ILL!  BUT WHEN THERE IS PLENTY OF MONEY ON ONE SIDE,
AND NEXT TO NONE ON THE OTHER, LORD BLESS YOU! THEY CARE
NO MORE ABOUT SUCH THINGS!--"

"THE LADY THEN--MISS GREY I THINK YOU CALLED HER--
IS VERY RICH?"

"FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS, MY DEAR.  DID YOU EVER SEE
HER? A SMART, STYLISH GIRL THEY SAY, BUT NOT HANDSOME.
I REMEMBER HER AUNT VERY WELL, BIDDY HENSHAWE; SHE MARRIED
A VERY WEALTHY MAN.  BUT THE FAMILY ARE ALL RICH TOGETHER.
FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS! AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IT WON'T COME
BEFORE IT'S WANTED; FOR THEY SAY HE IS ALL TO PIECES.
NO WONDER! DASHING ABOUT WITH HIS CURRICLE AND HUNTERS!
WELL, IT DON'T SIGNIFY TALKING; BUT WHEN A YOUNG MAN,
BE WHO HE WILL, COMES AND MAKES LOVE TO A PRETTY GIRL,
AND PROMISES MARRIAGE, HE HAS NO BUSINESS TO FLY OFF
FROM HIS WORD ONLY BECAUSE HE GROWS POOR, AND A RICHER
GIRL IS READY TO HAVE HIM.  WHY DON'T HE, IN SUCH A CASE,
SELL HIS HORSES, LET HIS HOUSE, TURN OFF HIS SERVANTS,
AND MAKE A THOROUGH REFORM AT ONCE? I WARRANT YOU,
MISS MARIANNE WOULD HAVE BEEN READY TO WAIT TILL MATTERS
CAME ROUND.  BUT THAT WON'T DO NOW-A-DAYS; NOTHING IN THE
WAY OF PLEASURE CAN EVER BE GIVEN UP BY THE YOUNG MEN OF
THIS AGE."

"DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF A GIRL MISS GREY IS?
IS SHE SAID TO BE AMIABLE?"

"I NEVER HEARD ANY HARM OF HER; INDEED I HARDLY EVER
HEARD HER MENTIONED; EXCEPT THAT MRS. TAYLOR DID SAY
THIS MORNING, THAT ONE DAY MISS WALKER HINTED TO HER,
THAT SHE BELIEVED MR. AND MRS. ELLISON WOULD NOT BE SORRY
TO HAVE MISS GREY MARRIED, FOR SHE AND MRS. ELLISON COULD
NEVER AGREE."--

"AND WHO ARE THE ELLISONS?"

"HER GUARDIANS, MY DEAR.  BUT NOW SHE IS OF AGE
AND MAY CHOOSE FOR HERSELF; AND A PRETTY CHOICE SHE HAS
MADE!--WHAT NOW," AFTER PAUSING A MOMENT--"YOUR POOR SISTER
IS GONE TO HER OWN ROOM, I SUPPOSE, TO MOAN BY HERSELF.
IS THERE NOTHING ONE CAN GET TO COMFORT HER?  POOR DEAR,
IT SEEMS QUITE CRUEL TO LET HER BE ALONE.  WELL, BY-AND-BY WE
SHALL HAVE A FEW FRIENDS, AND THAT WILL AMUSE HER A LITTLE.
WHAT SHALL WE PLAY AT?  SHE HATES WHIST I KNOW; BUT IS THERE
NO ROUND GAME SHE CARES FOR?"

"DEAR MA'AM, THIS KINDNESS IS QUITE UNNECESSARY.
MARIANNE, I DARE SAY, WILL NOT LEAVE HER ROOM AGAIN
THIS EVENING.  I SHALL PERSUADE HER IF I CAN TO GO
EARLY TO BED, FOR I AM SURE SHE WANTS REST."

"AYE, I BELIEVE THAT WILL BE BEST FOR HER.  LET HER NAME
HER OWN SUPPER, AND GO TO BED.  LORD! NO WONDER SHE HAS
BEEN LOOKING SO BAD AND SO CAST DOWN THIS LAST WEEK OR TWO,
FOR THIS MATTER I SUPPOSE HAS BEEN HANGING OVER HER HEAD AS
LONG AS THAT.  AND SO THE LETTER THAT CAME TODAY FINISHED IT!
POOR SOUL!  I AM SURE IF I HAD HAD A NOTION OF IT,
I WOULD NOT HAVE JOKED HER ABOUT IT FOR ALL MY MONEY.
BUT THEN YOU KNOW, HOW SHOULD I GUESS SUCH A THING?  I MADE
SURE OF ITS BEING NOTHING BUT A COMMON LOVE LETTER, AND
YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE TO BE LAUGHED AT ABOUT THEM.  LORD!
HOW CONCERNED SIR JOHN AND MY DAUGHTERS WILL BE WHEN THEY
HEAR IT!  IF I HAD MY SENSES ABOUT ME I MIGHT HAVE CALLED
IN CONDUIT STREET IN MY WAY HOME, AND TOLD THEM OF IT.
BUT I SHALL SEE THEM TOMORROW."

"IT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY I AM SURE, FOR YOU TO CAUTION
MRS. PALMER AND SIR JOHN AGAINST EVER NAMING MR. WILLOUGHBY,
OR MAKING THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TO WHAT HAS PASSED,
BEFORE MY SISTER.  THEIR OWN GOOD-NATURE MUST POINT OUT
TO THEM THE REAL CRUELTY OF APPEARING TO KNOW ANY THING
ABOUT IT WHEN SHE IS PRESENT; AND THE LESS THAT MAY EVER
BE SAID TO MYSELF ON THE SUBJECT, THE MORE MY FEELINGS
WILL BE SPARED, AS YOU MY DEAR MADAM WILL EASILY BELIEVE."

"OH! LORD! YES, THAT I DO INDEED.  IT MUST BE TERRIBLE
FOR YOU TO HEAR IT TALKED OF; AND AS FOR YOUR SISTER,
I AM SURE I WOULD NOT MENTION A WORD ABOUT IT TO HER
FOR THE WORLD.  YOU SAW I DID NOT ALL DINNER TIME.
NO MORE WOULD SIR JOHN, NOR MY DAUGHTERS, FOR THEY ARE
ALL VERY THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE; ESPECIALLY IF I
GIVE THEM A HINT, AS I CERTAINLY WILL.  FOR MY PART,
I THINK THE LESS THAT IS SAID ABOUT SUCH THINGS, THE BETTER,
THE SOONER 'TIS BLOWN OVER AND FORGOT.  AND WHAT DOES
TALKING EVER DO YOU KNOW?"

"IN THIS AFFAIR IT CAN ONLY DO HARM; MORE SO
PERHAPS THAN IN MANY CASES OF A SIMILAR KIND, FOR IT
HAS BEEN ATTENDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH, FOR THE SAKE
OF EVERY ONE CONCERNED IN IT, MAKE IT UNFIT TO BECOME
THE PUBLIC CONVERSATION.  I MUST DO THIS JUSTICE TO
MR. WILLOUGHBY--HE HAS BROKEN NO POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT
WITH MY SISTER."

"LAW, MY DEAR!  DON'T PRETEND TO DEFEND HIM.
NO POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT INDEED! AFTER TAKING HER ALL
OVER ALLENHAM HOUSE, AND FIXING ON THE VERY ROOMS THEY
WERE TO LIVE IN HEREAFTER!"

ELINOR, FOR HER SISTER'S SAKE, COULD NOT PRESS THE
SUBJECT FARTHER, AND SHE HOPED IT WAS NOT REQUIRED OF HER
FOR WILLOUGHBY'S; SINCE, THOUGH MARIANNE MIGHT LOSE MUCH,
HE COULD GAIN VERY LITTLE BY THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE REAL TRUTH.
AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ON BOTH SIDES, MRS. JENNINGS,
WITH ALL HER NATURAL HILARITY, BURST FORTH AGAIN.

"WELL, MY DEAR, 'TIS A TRUE SAYING ABOUT AN ILL-WIND,
FOR IT WILL BE ALL THE BETTER FOR COLONEL BRANDON.
HE WILL HAVE HER AT LAST; AYE, THAT HE WILL.  MIND ME,
NOW, IF THEY AN'T MARRIED BY MID-SUMMER.  LORD! HOW HE'LL
CHUCKLE OVER THIS NEWS!  I HOPE HE WILL COME TONIGHT.
IT WILL BE ALL TO ONE A BETTER MATCH FOR YOUR SISTER.
TWO THOUSAND A YEAR WITHOUT DEBT OR DRAWBACK--EXCEPT
THE LITTLE LOVE-CHILD, INDEED; AYE, I HAD FORGOT HER;
BUT SHE MAY BE 'PRENTICED OUT AT A SMALL COST, AND THEN
WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY?  DELAFORD IS A NICE PLACE, I CAN
TELL YOU; EXACTLY WHAT I CALL A NICE OLD FASHIONED PLACE,
FULL OF COMFORTS AND CONVENIENCES; QUITE SHUT IN WITH GREAT
GARDEN WALLS THAT ARE COVERED WITH THE BEST FRUIT-TREES
IN THE COUNTRY; AND SUCH A MULBERRY TREE IN ONE CORNER!
LORD! HOW CHARLOTTE AND I DID STUFF THE ONLY TIME WE
WERE THERE!  THEN, THERE IS A DOVE-COTE, SOME DELIGHTFUL
STEW-PONDS, AND A VERY PRETTY CANAL; AND EVERY THING,
IN SHORT, THAT ONE COULD WISH FOR; AND, MOREOVER, IT IS
CLOSE TO THE CHURCH, AND ONLY A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM
THE TURNPIKE-ROAD, SO 'TIS NEVER DULL, FOR IF YOU ONLY
GO AND SIT UP IN AN OLD YEW ARBOUR BEHIND THE HOUSE,
YOU MAY SEE ALL THE CARRIAGES THAT PASS ALONG.
OH! 'TIS A NICE PLACE!  A BUTCHER HARD BY IN THE VILLAGE,
AND THE PARSONAGE-HOUSE WITHIN A STONE'S THROW.
TO MY FANCY, A THOUSAND TIMES PRETTIER THAN BARTON PARK,
WHERE THEY ARE FORCED TO SEND THREE MILES FOR THEIR MEAT,
AND HAVE NOT A NEIGHBOUR NEARER THAN YOUR MOTHER.
WELL, I SHALL SPIRIT UP THE COLONEL AS SOON AS I CAN.
ONE SHOULDER OF MUTTON, YOU KNOW, DRIVES ANOTHER DOWN.
IF WE CAN BUT PUT WILLOUGHBY OUT OF HER HEAD!"

"AY, IF WE CAN DO THAT, MA'AM," SAID ELINOR,
"WE SHALL DO VERY WELL WITH OR WITHOUT COLONEL BRANDON."
AND THEN RISING, SHE WENT AWAY TO JOIN MARIANNE,
WHOM SHE FOUND, AS SHE EXPECTED, IN HER OWN ROOM, LEANING,
IN SILENT MISERY, OVER THE SMALL REMAINS OF A FIRE,
WHICH, TILL ELINOR'S ENTRANCE, HAD BEEN HER ONLY LIGHT.

"YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME," WAS ALL THE NOTICE
THAT HER SISTER RECEIVED FROM HER.

"I WILL LEAVE YOU," SAID ELINOR, "IF YOU WILL GO
TO BED." BUT THIS, FROM THE MOMENTARY PERVERSENESS
OF IMPATIENT SUFFERING, SHE AT FIRST REFUSED TO DO.
HER SISTER'S EARNEST, THOUGH GENTLE PERSUASION, HOWEVER,
SOON SOFTENED HER TO COMPLIANCE, AND ELINOR SAW HER
LAY HER ACHING HEAD ON THE PILLOW, AND AS SHE HOPED,
IN A WAY TO GET SOME QUIET REST BEFORE SHE LEFT HER.

IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, WHITHER SHE THEN REPAIRED,
SHE WAS SOON JOINED BY MRS. JENNINGS, WITH A WINE-GLASS,
FULL OF SOMETHING, IN HER HAND.

"MY DEAR," SAID SHE, ENTERING, "I HAVE JUST RECOLLECTED
THAT I HAVE SOME OF THE FINEST OLD CONSTANTIA WINE IN THE
HOUSE THAT EVER WAS TASTED, SO I HAVE BROUGHT A GLASS OF IT
FOR YOUR SISTER.  MY POOR HUSBAND! HOW FOND HE WAS OF IT!
WHENEVER HE HAD A TOUCH OF HIS OLD COLICKY GOUT, HE SAID
IT DID HIM MORE GOOD THAN ANY THING ELSE IN THE WORLD.
DO TAKE IT TO YOUR SISTER."

"DEAR MA'AM," REPLIED ELINOR, SMILING AT THE DIFFERENCE
OF THE COMPLAINTS FOR WHICH IT WAS RECOMMENDED, "HOW GOOD
YOU ARE!  BUT I HAVE JUST LEFT MARIANNE IN BED, AND, I HOPE,
ALMOST ASLEEP; AND AS I THINK NOTHING WILL BE OF SO MUCH
SERVICE TO HER AS REST, IF YOU WILL GIVE ME LEAVE,
I WILL DRINK THE WINE MYSELF."

MRS. JENNINGS, THOUGH REGRETTING THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN
FIVE MINUTES EARLIER, WAS SATISFIED WITH THE COMPROMISE;
AND ELINOR, AS SHE SWALLOWED THE CHIEF OF IT, REFLECTED,
THAT THOUGH ITS EFFECTS ON A COLICKY GOUT WERE, AT PRESENT,
OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO HER, ITS HEALING POWERS,
ON A DISAPPOINTED HEART MIGHT BE AS REASONABLY TRIED
ON HERSELF AS ON HER SISTER.

COLONEL BRANDON CAME IN WHILE THE PARTY WERE AT TEA,
AND BY HIS MANNER OF LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM FOR MARIANNE,
ELINOR IMMEDIATELY FANCIED THAT HE NEITHER EXPECTED
NOR WISHED TO SEE HER THERE, AND, IN SHORT, THAT HE
WAS ALREADY AWARE OF WHAT OCCASIONED HER ABSENCE.
MRS. JENNINGS WAS NOT STRUCK BY THE SAME THOUGHT;
FOR SOON AFTER HIS ENTRANCE, SHE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM
TO THE TEA-TABLE WHERE ELINOR PRESIDED, AND WHISPERED--
"THE COLONEL LOOKS AS GRAVE AS EVER YOU SEE.  HE KNOWS
NOTHING OF IT; DO TELL HIM, MY DEAR."

HE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS DREW A CHAIR CLOSE TO HER'S,
AND, WITH A LOOK WHICH PERFECTLY ASSURED HER OF HIS
GOOD INFORMATION, INQUIRED AFTER HER SISTER.

"MARIANNE IS NOT WELL," SAID SHE.  "SHE HAS BEEN
INDISPOSED ALL DAY, AND WE HAVE PERSUADED HER TO GO TO BED."

"PERHAPS, THEN," HE HESITATINGLY REPLIED, "WHAT I
HEARD THIS MORNING MAY BE--THERE MAY BE MORE TRUTH IN IT
THAN I COULD BELIEVE POSSIBLE AT FIRST."

"WHAT DID YOU HEAR?"

"THAT A GENTLEMAN, WHOM I HAD REASON TO THINK--IN SHORT,
THAT A MAN, WHOM I KNEW TO BE ENGAGED--BUT HOW SHALL I
TELL YOU?  IF YOU KNOW IT ALREADY, AS SURELY YOU MUST,
I MAY BE SPARED."

"YOU MEAN," ANSWERED ELINOR, WITH FORCED CALMNESS,
"MR. WILLOUGHBY'S MARRIAGE WITH MISS GREY.  YES, WE DO
KNOW IT ALL.  THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A DAY OF GENERAL
ELUCIDATION, FOR THIS VERY MORNING FIRST UNFOLDED IT TO US.
MR. WILLOUGHBY IS UNFATHOMABLE!  WHERE DID YOU HEAR IT?"

"IN A STATIONER'S SHOP IN PALL MALL, WHERE I
HAD BUSINESS.  TWO LADIES WERE WAITING FOR THEIR CARRIAGE,
AND ONE OF THEM WAS GIVING THE OTHER AN ACCOUNT OF THE
INTENDED MATCH, IN A VOICE SO LITTLE ATTEMPTING CONCEALMENT,
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOT TO HEAR ALL.  THE NAME
OF WILLOUGHBY, JOHN WILLOUGHBY, FREQUENTLY REPEATED,
FIRST CAUGHT MY ATTENTION; AND WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A POSITIVE
ASSERTION THAT EVERY THING WAS NOW FINALLY SETTLED
RESPECTING HIS MARRIAGE WITH MISS GREY--IT WAS NO LONGER
TO BE A SECRET--IT WOULD TAKE PLACE EVEN WITHIN A FEW WEEKS,
WITH MANY PARTICULARS OF PREPARATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS.
ONE THING, ESPECIALLY, I REMEMBER, BECAUSE IT SERVED
TO IDENTIFY THE MAN STILL MORE:--AS SOON AS THE CEREMONY
WAS OVER, THEY WERE TO GO TO COMBE MAGNA, HIS SEAT
IN SOMERSETSHIRE.  MY ASTONISHMENT!--BUT IT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE WHAT I FELT.  THE COMMUNICATIVE
LADY I LEARNT, ON INQUIRY, FOR I STAYED IN THE SHOP
TILL THEY WERE GONE, WAS A MRS. ELLISON, AND THAT, AS I
HAVE BEEN SINCE INFORMED, IS THE NAME OF MISS GREY'S GUARDIAN."

"IT IS.  BUT HAVE YOU LIKEWISE HEARD THAT MISS GREY
HAS FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS?  IN THAT, IF IN ANY THING,
WE MAY FIND AN EXPLANATION."

"IT MAY BE SO; BUT WILLOUGHBY IS CAPABLE--AT LEAST
I THINK"--HE STOPPED A MOMENT; THEN ADDED IN A VOICE
WHICH SEEMED TO DISTRUST ITSELF, "AND YOUR SISTER--
HOW DID SHE--"

"HER SUFFERINGS HAVE BEEN VERY SEVERE.  I HAVE
ONLY TO HOPE THAT THEY MAY BE PROPORTIONATELY SHORT.
IT HAS BEEN, IT IS A MOST CRUEL AFFLICTION.  TILL YESTERDAY,
I BELIEVE, SHE NEVER DOUBTED HIS REGARD; AND EVEN NOW,
PERHAPS--BUT I AM ALMOST CONVINCED THAT HE NEVER WAS
REALLY ATTACHED TO HER.  HE HAS BEEN VERY DECEITFUL! AND,
IN SOME POINTS, THERE SEEMS A HARDNESS OF HEART ABOUT HIM."

"AH!" SAID COLONEL BRANDON, "THERE IS, INDEED!  BUT
YOUR SISTER DOES NOT--I THINK YOU SAID SO--SHE DOES
NOT CONSIDER QUITE AS YOU DO?"

"YOU KNOW HER DISPOSITION, AND MAY BELIEVE HOW EAGERLY
SHE WOULD STILL JUSTIFY HIM IF SHE COULD."

HE MADE NO ANSWER; AND SOON AFTERWARDS, BY THE REMOVAL
OF THE TEA-THINGS, AND THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE CARD PARTIES,
THE SUBJECT WAS NECESSARILY DROPPED.  MRS. JENNINGS, WHO HAD
WATCHED THEM WITH PLEASURE WHILE THEY WERE TALKING, AND WHO
EXPECTED TO SEE THE EFFECT OF MISS DASHWOOD'S COMMUNICATION,
IN SUCH AN INSTANTANEOUS GAIETY ON COLONEL BRANDON'S SIDE,
AS MIGHT HAVE BECOME A MAN IN THE BLOOM OF YOUTH, OF HOPE
AND HAPPINESS, SAW HIM, WITH AMAZEMENT, REMAIN THE WHOLE
EVENING MORE SERIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL THAN USUAL.



CHAPTER 31


FROM A NIGHT OF MORE SLEEP THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED,
MARIANNE AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING TO THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS
OF MISERY IN WHICH SHE HAD CLOSED HER EYES.

ELINOR ENCOURAGED HER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO TALK
OF WHAT SHE FELT; AND BEFORE BREAKFAST WAS READY, THEY HAD
GONE THROUGH THE SUBJECT AGAIN AND AGAIN; AND WITH THE SAME
STEADY CONVICTION AND AFFECTIONATE COUNSEL ON ELINOR'S SIDE,
THE SAME IMPETUOUS FEELINGS AND VARYING OPINIONS ON
MARIANNE'S, AS BEFORE.  SOMETIMES SHE COULD BELIEVE
WILLOUGHBY TO BE AS UNFORTUNATE AND AS INNOCENT AS HERSELF,
AND AT OTHERS, LOST EVERY CONSOLATION IN THE IMPOSSIBILITY
OF ACQUITTING HIM.  AT ONE MOMENT SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY
INDIFFERENT TO THE OBSERVATION OF ALL THE WORLD, AT ANOTHER
SHE WOULD SECLUDE HERSELF FROM IT FOR EVER, AND AT A THIRD
COULD RESIST IT WITH ENERGY.  IN ONE THING, HOWEVER,
SHE WAS UNIFORM, WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT, IN AVOIDING,
WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE, THE PRESENCE OF MRS. JENNINGS,
AND IN A DETERMINED SILENCE WHEN OBLIGED TO ENDURE IT.
HER HEART WAS HARDENED AGAINST THE BELIEF OF MRS. JENNINGS'S
ENTERING INTO HER SORROWS WITH ANY COMPASSION.

"NO, NO, NO, IT CANNOT BE," SHE CRIED;
"SHE CANNOT FEEL.  HER KINDNESS IS NOT SYMPATHY;
HER GOOD-NATURE IS NOT TENDERNESS.  ALL THAT SHE WANTS
IS GOSSIP, AND SHE ONLY LIKES ME NOW BECAUSE I SUPPLY IT."

ELINOR HAD NOT NEEDED THIS TO BE ASSURED OF THE INJUSTICE
TO WHICH HER SISTER WAS OFTEN LED IN HER OPINION OF OTHERS,
BY THE IRRITABLE REFINEMENT OF HER OWN MIND, AND THE TOO
GREAT IMPORTANCE PLACED BY HER ON THE DELICACIES OF A
STRONG SENSIBILITY, AND THE GRACES OF A POLISHED MANNER.
LIKE HALF THE REST OF THE WORLD, IF MORE THAN HALF THERE
BE THAT ARE CLEVER AND GOOD, MARIANNE, WITH EXCELLENT
ABILITIES AND AN EXCELLENT DISPOSITION, WAS NEITHER
REASONABLE NOR CANDID.  SHE EXPECTED FROM OTHER PEOPLE
THE SAME OPINIONS AND FEELINGS AS HER OWN, AND SHE JUDGED
OF THEIR MOTIVES BY THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THEIR ACTIONS
ON HERSELF.  THUS A CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED, WHILE THE
SISTERS WERE TOGETHER IN THEIR OWN ROOM AFTER BREAKFAST,
WHICH SUNK THE HEART OF MRS. JENNINGS STILL LOWER
IN HER ESTIMATION; BECAUSE, THROUGH HER OWN WEAKNESS,
IT CHANCED TO PROVE A SOURCE OF FRESH PAIN TO HERSELF,
THOUGH MRS. JENNINGS WAS GOVERNED IN IT BY AN IMPULSE
OF THE UTMOST GOODWILL.

WITH A LETTER IN HER OUTSTRETCHED HAND, AND COUNTENANCE
GAILY SMILING, FROM THE PERSUASION OF BRINGING COMFORT,
SHE ENTERED THEIR ROOM, SAYING,

"NOW, MY DEAR, I BRING YOU SOMETHING THAT I AM SURE
WILL DO YOU GOOD."

MARIANNE HEARD ENOUGH.  IN ONE MOMENT HER IMAGINATION
PLACED BEFORE HER A LETTER FROM WILLOUGHBY, FULL OF TENDERNESS
AND CONTRITION, EXPLANATORY OF ALL THAT HAD PASSED, SATISFACTORY,
CONVINCING; AND INSTANTLY FOLLOWED BY WILLOUGHBY HIMSELF,
RUSHING EAGERLY INTO THE ROOM TO INFORCE, AT HER FEET,
BY THE ELOQUENCE OF HIS EYES, THE ASSURANCES OF HIS LETTER.
THE WORK OF ONE MOMENT WAS DESTROYED BY THE NEXT.
THE HAND WRITING OF HER MOTHER, NEVER TILL THEN UNWELCOME,
WAS BEFORE HER; AND, IN THE ACUTENESS OF THE DISAPPOINTMENT
WHICH FOLLOWED SUCH AN ECSTASY OF MORE THAN HOPE,
SHE FELT AS IF, TILL THAT INSTANT, SHE HAD NEVER SUFFERED.

THE CRUELTY OF MRS. JENNINGS NO LANGUAGE, WITHIN
HER REACH IN HER MOMENTS OF HAPPIEST ELOQUENCE,
COULD HAVE EXPRESSED; AND NOW SHE COULD REPROACH HER
ONLY BY THE TEARS WHICH STREAMED FROM HER EYES WITH
PASSIONATE VIOLENCE--A REPROACH, HOWEVER, SO ENTIRELY
LOST ON ITS OBJECT, THAT AFTER MANY EXPRESSIONS OF PITY,
SHE WITHDREW, STILL REFERRING HER TO THE LETTER OF COMFORT.
BUT THE LETTER, WHEN SHE WAS CALM ENOUGH TO READ IT,
BROUGHT LITTLE COMFORT.  WILLOUGHBY FILLED EVERY PAGE.
HER MOTHER, STILL CONFIDENT OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT, AND RELYING
AS WARMLY AS EVER ON HIS CONSTANCY, HAD ONLY BEEN ROUSED
BY ELINOR'S APPLICATION, TO INTREAT FROM MARIANNE GREATER
OPENNESS TOWARDS THEM BOTH; AND THIS, WITH SUCH TENDERNESS
TOWARDS HER, SUCH AFFECTION FOR WILLOUGHBY, AND SUCH
A CONVICTION OF THEIR FUTURE HAPPINESS IN EACH OTHER,
THAT SHE WEPT WITH AGONY THROUGH THE WHOLE OF IT.

ALL HER IMPATIENCE TO BE AT HOME AGAIN NOW RETURNED;
HER MOTHER WAS DEARER TO HER THAN EVER; DEARER THROUGH
THE VERY EXCESS OF HER MISTAKEN CONFIDENCE IN WILLOUGHBY,
AND SHE WAS WILDLY URGENT TO BE GONE.  ELINOR, UNABLE HERSELF
TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WERE BETTER FOR MARIANNE TO BE
IN LONDON OR AT BARTON, OFFERED NO COUNSEL OF HER OWN
EXCEPT OF PATIENCE TILL THEIR MOTHER'S WISHES COULD BE KNOWN;
AND AT LENGTH SHE OBTAINED HER SISTER'S CONSENT TO WAIT
FOR THAT KNOWLEDGE.

MRS. JENNINGS LEFT THEM EARLIER THAN USUAL; FOR SHE
COULD NOT BE EASY TILL THE MIDDLETONS AND PALMERS WERE ABLE
TO GRIEVE AS MUCH AS HERSELF; AND POSITIVELY REFUSING
ELINOR'S OFFERED ATTENDANCE, WENT OUT ALONE FOR THE REST
OF THE MORNING.  ELINOR, WITH A VERY HEAVY HEART, AWARE OF
THE PAIN SHE WAS GOING TO COMMUNICATE, AND PERCEIVING,
BY MARIANNE'S LETTER, HOW ILL SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN LAYING
ANY FOUNDATION FOR IT, THEN SAT DOWN TO WRITE HER MOTHER
AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD PASSED, AND ENTREAT HER DIRECTIONS
FOR THE FUTURE; WHILE MARIANNE, WHO CAME INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM
ON MRS. JENNINGS'S GOING AWAY, REMAINED FIXED AT THE TABLE
WHERE ELINOR WROTE, WATCHING THE ADVANCEMENT OF HER PEN,
GRIEVING OVER HER FOR THE HARDSHIP OF SUCH A TASK,
AND GRIEVING STILL MORE FONDLY OVER ITS EFFECT ON HER MOTHER.

IN THIS MANNER THEY HAD CONTINUED ABOUT A QUARTER
OF AN HOUR, WHEN MARIANNE, WHOSE NERVES COULD NOT THEN
BEAR ANY SUDDEN NOISE, WAS STARTLED BY A RAP AT THE DOOR.

"WHO CAN THIS BE?" CRIED ELINOR.  "SO EARLY TOO! I
THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN SAFE."

MARIANNE MOVED TO THE WINDOW--

"IT IS COLONEL BRANDON!" SAID SHE, WITH VEXATION.
"WE ARE NEVER SAFE FROM HIM."

"HE WILL NOT COME IN, AS MRS. JENNINGS IS FROM HOME."

"I WILL NOT TRUST TO THAT," RETREATING TO HER OWN ROOM.
"A MAN WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS OWN TIME HAS NO
CONSCIENCE IN HIS INTRUSION ON THAT OF OTHERS."

THE EVENT PROVED HER CONJECTURE RIGHT, THOUGH IT
WAS FOUNDED ON INJUSTICE AND ERROR; FOR COLONEL BRANDON
DID COME IN; AND ELINOR, WHO WAS CONVINCED THAT
SOLICITUDE FOR MARIANNE BROUGHT HIM THITHER, AND WHO SAW
THAT SOLICITUDE IN HIS DISTURBED AND MELANCHOLY LOOK,
AND IN HIS ANXIOUS THOUGH BRIEF INQUIRY AFTER HER,
COULD NOT FORGIVE HER SISTER FOR ESTEEMING HIM SO LIGHTLY.

"I MET MRS. JENNINGS IN BOND STREET," SAID HE,
AFTER THE FIRST SALUTATION, "AND SHE ENCOURAGED ME
TO COME ON; AND I WAS THE MORE EASILY ENCOURAGED,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT I MIGHT FIND YOU ALONE,
WHICH I WAS VERY DESIROUS OF DOING.  MY OBJECT--MY
WISH--MY SOLE WISH IN DESIRING IT--I HOPE, I BELIEVE
IT IS--IS TO BE A MEANS OF GIVING COMFORT;--NO, I MUST
NOT SAY COMFORT--NOT PRESENT COMFORT--BUT CONVICTION,
LASTING CONVICTION TO YOUR SISTER'S MIND.  MY REGARD FOR HER,
FOR YOURSELF, FOR YOUR MOTHER--WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO PROVE IT,
BY RELATING SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH NOTHING BUT A VERY
SINCERE REGARD--NOTHING BUT AN EARNEST DESIRE OF BEING
USEFUL--I THINK I AM JUSTIFIED--THOUGH WHERE SO MANY HOURS
HAVE BEEN SPENT IN CONVINCING MYSELF THAT I AM RIGHT,
IS THERE NOT SOME REASON TO FEAR I MAY BE WRONG?"
HE STOPPED.

"I UNDERSTAND YOU," SAID ELINOR.  "YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL ME OF MR. WILLOUGHBY, THAT WILL OPEN HIS CHARACTER
FARTHER.  YOUR TELLING IT WILL BE THE GREATEST ACT OF FRIENDSHIP
THAT CAN BE SHEWN MARIANNE.  MY GRATITUDE WILL BE INSURED
IMMEDIATELY BY ANY INFORMATION TENDING TO THAT END, AND HERS
MUST BE GAINED BY IT IN TIME.  PRAY, PRAY LET ME HEAR IT."

"YOU SHALL; AND, TO BE BRIEF, WHEN I QUITTED BARTON
LAST OCTOBER,--BUT THIS WILL GIVE YOU NO IDEA--I MUST GO
FARTHER BACK.  YOU WILL FIND ME A VERY AWKWARD NARRATOR,
MISS DASHWOOD; I HARDLY KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.  A SHORT
ACCOUNT OF MYSELF, I BELIEVE, WILL BE NECESSARY, AND IT
SHALL BE A SHORT ONE.  ON SUCH A SUBJECT," SIGHING HEAVILY,
"CAN I HAVE LITTLE TEMPTATION TO BE DIFFUSE."

HE STOPT A MOMENT FOR RECOLLECTION, AND THEN,
WITH ANOTHER SIGH, WENT ON.

"YOU HAVE PROBABLY ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN A CONVERSATION--
(IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT IT COULD MAKE ANY IMPRESSION
ON YOU)--A CONVERSATION BETWEEN US ONE EVENING AT BARTON
PARK--IT WAS THE EVENING OF A DANCE--IN WHICH I ALLUDED
TO A LADY I HAD ONCE KNOWN, AS RESEMBLING, IN SOME MEASURE,
YOUR SISTER MARIANNE."

"INDEED," ANSWERED ELINOR, "I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN IT."
HE LOOKED PLEASED BY THIS REMEMBRANCE, AND ADDED,

"IF I AM NOT DECEIVED BY THE UNCERTAINTY, THE PARTIALITY
OF TENDER RECOLLECTION, THERE IS A VERY STRONG RESEMBLANCE
BETWEEN THEM, AS WELL IN MIND AS PERSON.  THE SAME WARMTH
OF HEART, THE SAME EAGERNESS OF FANCY AND SPIRITS.
THIS LADY WAS ONE OF MY NEAREST RELATIONS, AN ORPHAN FROM
HER INFANCY, AND UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF MY FATHER.
OUR AGES WERE NEARLY THE SAME, AND FROM OUR EARLIEST YEARS
WE WERE PLAYFELLOWS AND FRIENDS.  I CANNOT REMEMBER THE
TIME WHEN I DID NOT LOVE ELIZA; AND MY AFFECTION FOR HER,
AS WE GREW UP, WAS SUCH, AS PERHAPS, JUDGING FROM MY
PRESENT FORLORN AND CHEERLESS GRAVITY, YOU MIGHT THINK ME
INCAPABLE OF HAVING EVER FELT.  HER'S, FOR ME, WAS, I BELIEVE,
FERVENT AS THE ATTACHMENT OF YOUR SISTER TO MR. WILLOUGHBY
AND IT WAS, THOUGH FROM A DIFFERENT CAUSE, NO LESS UNFORTUNATE.
AT SEVENTEEN SHE WAS LOST TO ME FOR EVER.  SHE WAS
MARRIED--MARRIED AGAINST HER INCLINATION TO MY BROTHER.
HER FORTUNE WAS LARGE, AND OUR FAMILY ESTATE MUCH ENCUMBERED.
AND THIS, I FEAR, IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID FOR THE
CONDUCT OF ONE, WHO WAS AT ONCE HER UNCLE AND GUARDIAN.
MY BROTHER DID NOT DESERVE HER; HE DID NOT EVEN LOVE HER.
I HAD HOPED THAT HER REGARD FOR ME WOULD SUPPORT HER
UNDER ANY DIFFICULTY, AND FOR SOME TIME IT DID; BUT AT
LAST THE MISERY OF HER SITUATION, FOR SHE EXPERIENCED
GREAT UNKINDNESS, OVERCAME ALL HER RESOLUTION, AND THOUGH
SHE HAD PROMISED ME THAT NOTHING--BUT HOW BLINDLY I
RELATE!  I HAVE NEVER TOLD YOU HOW THIS WAS BROUGHT ON.
WE WERE WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF ELOPING TOGETHER FOR SCOTLAND.
THE TREACHERY, OR THE FOLLY, OF MY COUSIN'S MAID BETRAYED US.
I WAS BANISHED TO THE HOUSE OF A RELATION FAR DISTANT,
AND SHE WAS ALLOWED NO LIBERTY, NO SOCIETY, NO AMUSEMENT,
TILL MY FATHER'S POINT WAS GAINED.  I HAD DEPENDED ON HER
FORTITUDE TOO FAR, AND THE BLOW WAS A SEVERE ONE--
BUT HAD HER MARRIAGE BEEN HAPPY, SO YOUNG AS I THEN WAS,
A FEW MONTHS MUST HAVE RECONCILED ME TO IT, OR AT LEAST
I SHOULD NOT HAVE NOW TO LAMENT IT.  THIS HOWEVER
WAS NOT THE CASE.  MY BROTHER HAD NO REGARD FOR HER;
HIS PLEASURES WERE NOT WHAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN,
AND FROM THE FIRST HE TREATED HER UNKINDLY.  THE CONSEQUENCE
OF THIS, UPON A MIND SO YOUNG, SO LIVELY, SO INEXPERIENCED
AS MRS. BRANDON'S, WAS BUT TOO NATURAL.  SHE RESIGNED
HERSELF AT FIRST TO ALL THE MISERY OF HER SITUATION;
AND HAPPY HAD IT BEEN IF SHE HAD NOT LIVED TO OVERCOME THOSE
REGRETS WHICH THE REMEMBRANCE OF ME OCCASIONED.  BUT CAN WE
WONDER THAT, WITH SUCH A HUSBAND TO PROVOKE INCONSTANCY,
AND WITHOUT A FRIEND TO ADVISE OR RESTRAIN HER (FOR
MY FATHER LIVED ONLY A FEW MONTHS AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE,
AND I WAS WITH MY REGIMENT IN THE EAST INDIES) SHE
SHOULD FALL?  HAD I REMAINED IN ENGLAND, PERHAPS--BUT I
MEANT TO PROMOTE THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH BY REMOVING
FROM HER FOR YEARS, AND FOR THAT PURPOSE HAD PROCURED
MY EXCHANGE.  THE SHOCK WHICH HER MARRIAGE HAD GIVEN ME,"
HE CONTINUED, IN A VOICE OF GREAT AGITATION, "WAS OF
TRIFLING WEIGHT--WAS NOTHING TO WHAT I FELT WHEN I HEARD,
ABOUT TWO YEARS AFTERWARDS, OF HER DIVORCE.  IT WAS
THAT WHICH THREW THIS GLOOM,--EVEN NOW THE RECOLLECTION
OF WHAT I SUFFERED--"

HE COULD SAY NO MORE, AND RISING HASTILY WALKED FOR A FEW
MINUTES ABOUT THE ROOM.  ELINOR, AFFECTED BY HIS RELATION,
AND STILL MORE BY HIS DISTRESS, COULD NOT SPEAK.  HE SAW
HER CONCERN, AND COMING TO HER, TOOK HER HAND, PRESSED IT,
AND KISSED IT WITH GRATEFUL RESPECT.  A FEW MINUTES MORE
OF SILENT EXERTION ENABLED HIM TO PROCEED WITH COMPOSURE.

"IT WAS NEARLY THREE YEARS AFTER THIS UNHAPPY
PERIOD BEFORE I RETURNED TO ENGLAND.  MY FIRST CARE,
WHEN I DID ARRIVE, WAS OF COURSE TO SEEK FOR HER;
BUT THE SEARCH WAS AS FRUITLESS AS IT WAS MELANCHOLY.
I COULD NOT TRACE HER BEYOND HER FIRST SEDUCER, AND THERE
WAS EVERY REASON TO FEAR THAT SHE HAD REMOVED FROM HIM
ONLY TO SINK DEEPER IN A LIFE OF SIN.  HER LEGAL ALLOWANCE
WAS NOT ADEQUATE TO HER FORTUNE, NOR SUFFICIENT FOR HER
COMFORTABLE MAINTENANCE, AND I LEARNT FROM MY BROTHER THAT
THE POWER OF RECEIVING IT HAD BEEN MADE OVER SOME MONTHS
BEFORE TO ANOTHER PERSON.  HE IMAGINED, AND CALMLY COULD HE
IMAGINE IT, THAT HER EXTRAVAGANCE, AND CONSEQUENT DISTRESS,
HAD OBLIGED HER TO DISPOSE OF IT FOR SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF.
AT LAST, HOWEVER, AND AFTER I HAD BEEN SIX MONTHS IN ENGLAND,
I DID FIND HER.  REGARD FOR A FORMER SERVANT OF MY OWN,
WHO HAD SINCE FALLEN INTO MISFORTUNE, CARRIED ME TO VISIT
HIM IN A SPUNGING-HOUSE, WHERE HE WAS CONFINED FOR DEBT;
AND THERE, THE SAME HOUSE, UNDER A SIMILAR CONFINEMENT,
WAS MY UNFORTUNATE SISTER.  SO ALTERED--SO FADED--WORN
DOWN BY ACUTE SUFFERING OF EVERY KIND! HARDLY COULD I
BELIEVE THE MELANCHOLY AND SICKLY FIGURE BEFORE ME,
TO BE THE REMAINS OF THE LOVELY, BLOOMING, HEALTHFUL GIRL,
ON WHOM I HAD ONCE DOTED.  WHAT I ENDURED IN SO BEHOLDING
HER--BUT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO WOUND YOUR FEELINGS BY ATTEMPTING
TO DESCRIBE IT--I HAVE PAINED YOU TOO MUCH ALREADY.
THAT SHE WAS, TO ALL APPEARANCE, IN THE LAST STAGE
OF A CONSUMPTION, WAS--YES, IN SUCH A SITUATION IT WAS
MY GREATEST COMFORT.  LIFE COULD DO NOTHING FOR HER,
BEYOND GIVING TIME FOR A BETTER PREPARATION FOR DEATH;
AND THAT WAS GIVEN.  I SAW HER PLACED IN COMFORTABLE LODGINGS,
AND UNDER PROPER ATTENDANTS; I VISITED HER EVERY DAY
DURING THE REST OF HER SHORT LIFE: I WAS WITH HER IN HER
LAST MOMENTS."

AGAIN HE STOPPED TO RECOVER HIMSELF; AND ELINOR
SPOKE HER FEELINGS IN AN EXCLAMATION OF TENDER CONCERN,
AT THE FATE OF HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIEND.

"YOUR SISTER, I HOPE, CANNOT BE OFFENDED," SAID HE,
"BY THE RESEMBLANCE I HAVE FANCIED BETWEEN HER AND MY
POOR DISGRACED RELATION.  THEIR FATES, THEIR FORTUNES,
CANNOT BE THE SAME; AND HAD THE NATURAL SWEET
DISPOSITION OF THE ONE BEEN GUARDED BY A FIRMER MIND,
OR A HAPPIER MARRIAGE, SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALL THAT YOU
WILL LIVE TO SEE THE OTHER BE.  BUT TO WHAT DOES ALL THIS
LEAD?  I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DISTRESSING YOU FOR NOTHING.
AH! MISS DASHWOOD--A SUBJECT SUCH AS THIS--UNTOUCHED
FOR FOURTEEN YEARS--IT IS DANGEROUS TO HANDLE IT AT ALL!
I WILL BE MORE COLLECTED--MORE CONCISE.  SHE LEFT TO MY CARE
HER ONLY CHILD, A LITTLE GIRL, THE OFFSPRING OF HER FIRST
GUILTY CONNECTION, WHO WAS THEN ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD.
SHE LOVED THE CHILD, AND HAD ALWAYS KEPT IT WITH HER.
IT WAS A VALUED, A PRECIOUS TRUST TO ME; AND GLADLY
WOULD I HAVE DISCHARGED IT IN THE STRICTEST SENSE,
BY WATCHING OVER HER EDUCATION MYSELF, HAD THE NATURE
OF OUR SITUATIONS ALLOWED IT; BUT I HAD NO FAMILY, NO HOME;
AND MY LITTLE ELIZA WAS THEREFORE PLACED AT SCHOOL.
I SAW HER THERE WHENEVER I COULD, AND AFTER THE DEATH OF MY
BROTHER, (WHICH HAPPENED ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO, AND WHICH
LEFT TO ME THE POSSESSION OF THE FAMILY PROPERTY,) SHE
VISITED ME AT DELAFORD.  I CALLED HER A DISTANT RELATION;
BUT I AM WELL AWARE THAT I HAVE IN GENERAL BEEN SUSPECTED
OF A MUCH NEARER CONNECTION WITH HER.  IT IS NOW THREE
YEARS AGO (SHE HAD JUST REACHED HER FOURTEENTH YEAR,)
THAT I REMOVED HER FROM SCHOOL, TO PLACE HER UNDER THE CARE
OF A VERY RESPECTABLE WOMAN, RESIDING IN DORSETSHIRE,
WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF FOUR OR FIVE OTHER GIRLS OF ABOUT
THE SAME TIME OF LIFE; AND FOR TWO YEARS I HAD EVERY REASON
TO BE PLEASED WITH HER SITUATION.  BUT LAST FEBRUARY,
ALMOST A TWELVEMONTH BACK, SHE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED.
I HAD ALLOWED HER, (IMPRUDENTLY, AS IT HAS SINCE TURNED
OUT,) AT HER EARNEST DESIRE, TO GO TO BATH WITH ONE OF
HER YOUNG FRIENDS, WHO WAS ATTENDING HER FATHER THERE
FOR HIS HEALTH.  I KNEW HIM TO BE A VERY GOOD SORT OF MAN,
AND I THOUGHT WELL OF HIS DAUGHTER--BETTER THAN SHE DESERVED,
FOR, WITH A MOST OBSTINATE AND ILL-JUDGED SECRECY,
SHE WOULD TELL NOTHING, WOULD GIVE NO CLUE, THOUGH SHE
CERTAINLY KNEW ALL.  HE, HER FATHER, A WELL-MEANING,
BUT NOT A QUICK-SIGHTED MAN, COULD REALLY, I BELIEVE,
GIVE NO INFORMATION; FOR HE HAD BEEN GENERALLY CONFINED
TO THE HOUSE, WHILE THE GIRLS WERE RANGING OVER THE TOWN
AND MAKING WHAT ACQUAINTANCE THEY CHOSE; AND HE TRIED
TO CONVINCE ME, AS THOROUGHLY AS HE WAS CONVINCED HIMSELF,
OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BEING ENTIRELY UNCONCERNED IN THE BUSINESS.
IN SHORT, I COULD LEARN NOTHING BUT THAT SHE WAS GONE;
ALL THE REST, FOR EIGHT LONG MONTHS, WAS LEFT TO CONJECTURE.
WHAT I THOUGHT, WHAT I FEARED, MAY BE IMAGINED; AND WHAT I
SUFFERED TOO."

"GOOD HEAVENS!" CRIED ELINOR, "COULD IT BE--COULD
WILLOUGHBY!"--

"THE FIRST NEWS THAT REACHED ME OF HER," HE CONTINUED,
"CAME IN A LETTER FROM HERSELF, LAST OCTOBER.
IT WAS FORWARDED TO ME FROM DELAFORD, AND I RECEIVED IT
ON THE VERY MORNING OF OUR INTENDED PARTY TO WHITWELL;
AND THIS WAS THE REASON OF MY LEAVING BARTON SO SUDDENLY,
WHICH I AM SURE MUST AT THE TIME HAVE APPEARED STRANGE
TO EVERY BODY, AND WHICH I BELIEVE GAVE OFFENCE TO SOME.
LITTLE DID MR. WILLOUGHBY IMAGINE, I SUPPOSE, WHEN HIS
LOOKS CENSURED ME FOR INCIVILITY IN BREAKING UP THE PARTY,
THAT I WAS CALLED AWAY TO THE RELIEF OF ONE WHOM HE
HAD MADE POOR AND MISERABLE; BUT HAD HE KNOWN IT,
WHAT WOULD IT HAVE AVAILED?  WOULD HE HAVE BEEN LESS
GAY OR LESS HAPPY IN THE SMILES OF YOUR SISTER?  NO,
HE HAD ALREADY DONE THAT, WHICH NO MAN WHO CAN FEEL
FOR ANOTHER WOULD DO.  HE HAD LEFT THE GIRL WHOSE
YOUTH AND INNOCENCE HE HAD SEDUCED, IN A SITUATION OF
THE UTMOST DISTRESS, WITH NO CREDITABLE HOME, NO HELP,
NO FRIENDS, IGNORANT OF HIS ADDRESS!  HE HAD LEFT HER,
PROMISING TO RETURN; HE NEITHER RETURNED, NOR WROTE,
NOR RELIEVED HER."

"THIS IS BEYOND EVERY THING!" EXCLAIMED ELINOR.

"HIS CHARACTER IS NOW BEFORE YOU; EXPENSIVE, DISSIPATED,
AND WORSE THAN BOTH.  KNOWING ALL THIS, AS I HAVE NOW
KNOWN IT MANY WEEKS, GUESS WHAT I MUST HAVE FELT ON SEEING
YOUR SISTER AS FOND OF HIM AS EVER, AND ON BEING ASSURED
THAT SHE WAS TO MARRY HIM: GUESS WHAT I MUST HAVE FELT
FOR ALL YOUR SAKES.  WHEN I CAME TO YOU LAST WEEK AND
FOUND YOU ALONE, I CAME DETERMINED TO KNOW THE TRUTH;
THOUGH IRRESOLUTE WHAT TO DO WHEN IT WAS KNOWN.
MY BEHAVIOUR MUST HAVE SEEMED STRANGE TO YOU THEN;
BUT NOW YOU WILL COMPREHEND IT.  TO SUFFER YOU ALL TO BE
SO DECEIVED; TO SEE YOUR SISTER--BUT WHAT COULD I DO?
I HAD NO HOPE OF INTERFERING WITH SUCCESS; AND SOMETIMES
I THOUGHT YOUR SISTER'S INFLUENCE MIGHT YET RECLAIM HIM.
BUT NOW, AFTER SUCH DISHONORABLE USAGE, WHO CAN TELL WHAT
WERE HIS DESIGNS ON HER.  WHATEVER THEY MAY HAVE BEEN,
HOWEVER, SHE MAY NOW, AND HEREAFTER DOUBTLESS WILL
TURN WITH GRATITUDE TOWARDS HER OWN CONDITION, WHEN SHE
COMPARES IT WITH THAT OF MY POOR ELIZA, WHEN SHE CONSIDERS
THE WRETCHED AND HOPELESS SITUATION OF THIS POOR GIRL,
AND PICTURES HER TO HERSELF, WITH AN AFFECTION FOR HIM SO STRONG,
STILL AS STRONG AS HER OWN, AND WITH A MIND TORMENTED
BY SELF-REPROACH, WHICH MUST ATTEND HER THROUGH LIFE.
SURELY THIS COMPARISON MUST HAVE ITS USE WITH HER.
SHE WILL FEEL HER OWN SUFFERINGS TO BE NOTHING.  THEY
PROCEED FROM NO MISCONDUCT, AND CAN BRING NO DISGRACE.
ON THE CONTRARY, EVERY FRIEND MUST BE MADE STILL MORE
HER FRIEND BY THEM.  CONCERN FOR HER UNHAPPINESS,
AND RESPECT FOR HER FORTITUDE UNDER IT, MUST STRENGTHEN
EVERY ATTACHMENT.  USE YOUR OWN DISCRETION, HOWEVER,
IN COMMUNICATING TO HER WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU.  YOU MUST
KNOW BEST WHAT WILL BE ITS EFFECT; BUT HAD I NOT SERIOUSLY,
AND FROM MY HEART BELIEVED IT MIGHT BE OF SERVICE,
MIGHT LESSEN HER REGRETS, I WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFERED
MYSELF TO TROUBLE YOU WITH THIS ACCOUNT OF MY FAMILY
AFFLICTIONS, WITH A RECITAL WHICH MAY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN
INTENDED TO RAISE MYSELF AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS."

ELINOR'S THANKS FOLLOWED THIS SPEECH WITH GRATEFUL
EARNESTNESS; ATTENDED TOO WITH THE ASSURANCE OF HER
EXPECTING MATERIAL ADVANTAGE TO MARIANNE, FROM THE
COMMUNICATION OF WHAT HAD PASSED.

"I HAVE BEEN MORE PAINED," SAID SHE, "BY HER
ENDEAVORS TO ACQUIT HIM THAN BY ALL THE REST; FOR IT
IRRITATES HER MIND MORE THAN THE MOST PERFECT CONVICTION
OF HIS UNWORTHINESS CAN DO.  NOW, THOUGH AT FIRST SHE
WILL SUFFER MUCH, I AM SURE SHE WILL SOON BECOME EASIER.
HAVE YOU," SHE CONTINUED, AFTER A SHORT SILENCE,
"EVER SEEN MR. WILLOUGHBY SINCE YOU LEFT HIM AT BARTON?"

"YES," HE REPLIED GRAVELY, "ONCE I HAVE.  ONE MEETING
WAS UNAVOIDABLE."

ELINOR, STARTLED BY HIS MANNER, LOOKED AT HIM ANXIOUSLY,
SAYING,

"WHAT? HAVE YOU MET HIM TO--"

"I COULD MEET HIM NO OTHER WAY.  ELIZA HAD CONFESSED
TO ME, THOUGH MOST RELUCTANTLY, THE NAME OF HER LOVER;
AND WHEN HE RETURNED TO TOWN, WHICH WAS WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
AFTER MYSELF, WE MET BY APPOINTMENT, HE TO DEFEND,
I TO PUNISH HIS CONDUCT.  WE RETURNED UNWOUNDED,
AND THE MEETING, THEREFORE, NEVER GOT ABROAD."

ELINOR SIGHED OVER THE FANCIED NECESSITY OF THIS;
BUT TO A MAN AND A SOLDIER SHE PRESUMED NOT TO CENSURE IT.

"SUCH," SAID COLONEL BRANDON, AFTER A PAUSE,
"HAS BEEN THE UNHAPPY RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE FATE OF MOTHER
AND DAUGHTER! AND SO IMPERFECTLY HAVE I DISCHARGED MY TRUST!"

"IS SHE STILL IN TOWN?"

"NO; AS SOON AS SHE RECOVERED FROM HER LYING-IN,
FOR I FOUND HER NEAR HER DELIVERY, I REMOVED HER AND HER
CHILD INTO THE COUNTRY, AND THERE SHE REMAINS."

RECOLLECTING, SOON AFTERWARDS, THAT HE WAS PROBABLY
DIVIDING ELINOR FROM HER SISTER, HE PUT AN END TO HIS VISIT,
RECEIVING FROM HER AGAIN THE SAME GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS,
AND LEAVING HER FULL OF COMPASSION AND ESTEEM FOR HIM.



CHAPTER 32


WHEN THE PARTICULARS OF THIS CONVERSATION WERE REPEATED
BY MISS DASHWOOD TO HER SISTER, AS THEY VERY SOON WERE,
THE EFFECT ON HER WAS NOT ENTIRELY SUCH AS THE FORMER
HAD HOPED TO SEE.  NOT THAT MARIANNE APPEARED TO DISTRUST
THE TRUTH OF ANY PART OF IT, FOR SHE LISTENED TO IT ALL
WITH THE MOST STEADY AND SUBMISSIVE ATTENTION, MADE NEITHER
OBJECTION NOR REMARK, ATTEMPTED NO VINDICATION OF WILLOUGHBY,
AND SEEMED TO SHEW BY HER TEARS THAT SHE FELT IT TO
BE IMPOSSIBLE.  BUT THOUGH THIS BEHAVIOUR ASSURED ELINOR
THAT THE CONVICTION OF THIS GUILT WAS CARRIED HOME TO
HER MIND, THOUGH SHE SAW WITH SATISFACTION THE EFFECT OF IT,
IN HER NO LONGER AVOIDING COLONEL BRANDON WHEN HE CALLED,
IN HER SPEAKING TO HIM, EVEN VOLUNTARILY SPEAKING,
WITH A KIND OF COMPASSIONATE RESPECT, AND THOUGH SHE
SAW HER SPIRITS LESS VIOLENTLY IRRITATED THAN BEFORE,
SHE DID NOT SEE HER LESS WRETCHED.  HER MIND DID BECOME
SETTLED, BUT IT WAS SETTLED IN A GLOOMY DEJECTION.
SHE FELT THE LOSS OF WILLOUGHBY'S CHARACTER YET MORE HEAVILY
THAN SHE HAD FELT THE LOSS OF HIS HEART; HIS SEDUCTION AND
DESERTION OF MISS WILLIAMS, THE MISERY OF THAT POOR GIRL,
AND THE DOUBT OF WHAT HIS DESIGNS MIGHT ONCE HAVE BEEN
ON HERSELF, PREYED ALTOGETHER SO MUCH ON HER SPIRITS,
THAT SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SPEAK OF WHAT SHE FELT
EVEN TO ELINOR; AND, BROODING OVER HER SORROWS IN SILENCE,
GAVE MORE PAIN TO HER SISTER THAN COULD HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATED
BY THE MOST OPEN AND MOST FREQUENT CONFESSION OF THEM.

TO GIVE THE FEELINGS OR THE LANGUAGE OF MRS. DASHWOOD
ON RECEIVING AND ANSWERING ELINOR'S LETTER WOULD BE ONLY
TO GIVE A REPETITION OF WHAT HER DAUGHTERS HAD ALREADY FELT
AND SAID; OF A DISAPPOINTMENT HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN
MARIANNE'S, AND AN INDIGNATION EVEN GREATER THAN ELINOR'S.
LONG LETTERS FROM HER, QUICKLY SUCCEEDING EACH OTHER,
ARRIVED TO TELL ALL THAT SHE SUFFERED AND THOUGHT;
TO EXPRESS HER ANXIOUS SOLICITUDE FOR MARIANNE, AND ENTREAT
SHE WOULD BEAR UP WITH FORTITUDE UNDER THIS MISFORTUNE.
BAD INDEED MUST THE NATURE OF MARIANNE'S AFFLICTION BE,
WHEN HER MOTHER COULD TALK OF FORTITUDE! MORTIFYING
AND HUMILIATING MUST BE THE ORIGIN OF THOSE REGRETS,
WHICH SHE COULD WISH HER NOT TO INDULGE!

AGAINST THE INTEREST OF HER OWN INDIVIDUAL COMFORT,
MRS. DASHWOOD HAD DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR
MARIANNE TO BE ANY WHERE, AT THAT TIME, THAN AT BARTON,
WHERE EVERY THING WITHIN HER VIEW WOULD BE BRINGING BACK
THE PAST IN THE STRONGEST AND MOST AFFLICTING MANNER,
BY CONSTANTLY PLACING WILLOUGHBY BEFORE HER, SUCH AS
SHE HAD ALWAYS SEEN HIM THERE.  SHE RECOMMENDED IT TO
HER DAUGHTERS, THEREFORE, BY ALL MEANS NOT TO SHORTEN THEIR
VISIT TO MRS. JENNINGS; THE LENGTH OF WHICH, THOUGH NEVER
EXACTLY FIXED, HAD BEEN EXPECTED BY ALL TO COMPRISE AT LEAST
FIVE OR SIX WEEKS.  A VARIETY OF OCCUPATIONS, OF OBJECTS,
AND OF COMPANY, WHICH COULD NOT BE PROCURED AT BARTON,
WOULD BE INEVITABLE THERE, AND MIGHT YET, SHE HOPED,
CHEAT MARIANNE, AT TIMES, INTO SOME INTEREST BEYOND HERSELF,
AND EVEN INTO SOME AMUSEMENT, MUCH AS THE IDEAS OF BOTH
MIGHT NOW BE SPURNED BY HER.

FROM ALL DANGER OF SEEING WILLOUGHBY AGAIN,
HER MOTHER CONSIDERED HER TO BE AT LEAST EQUALLY SAFE
IN TOWN AS IN THE COUNTRY, SINCE HIS ACQUAINTANCE MUST
NOW BE DROPPED BY ALL WHO CALLED THEMSELVES HER FRIENDS.
DESIGN COULD NEVER BRING THEM IN EACH OTHER'S WAY:
NEGLIGENCE COULD NEVER LEAVE THEM EXPOSED TO A SURPRISE;
AND CHANCE HAD LESS IN ITS FAVOUR IN THE CROWD OF LONDON
THAN EVEN IN THE RETIREMENT OF BARTON, WHERE IT MIGHT
FORCE HIM BEFORE HER WHILE PAYING THAT VISIT AT ALLENHAM
ON HIS MARRIAGE, WHICH MRS. DASHWOOD, FROM FORESEEING AT
FIRST AS A PROBABLE EVENT, HAD BROUGHT HERSELF TO EXPECT
AS A CERTAIN ONE.

SHE HAD YET ANOTHER REASON FOR WISHING HER CHILDREN
TO REMAIN WHERE THEY WERE; A LETTER FROM HER SON-IN-LAW
HAD TOLD HER THAT HE AND HIS WIFE WERE TO BE IN TOWN
BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY, AND SHE JUDGED IT RIGHT
THAT THEY SHOULD SOMETIMES SEE THEIR BROTHER.

MARIANNE HAD PROMISED TO BE GUIDED BY HER MOTHER'S OPINION,
AND SHE SUBMITTED TO IT THEREFORE WITHOUT OPPOSITION,
THOUGH IT PROVED PERFECTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT SHE WISHED
AND EXPECTED, THOUGH SHE FELT IT TO BE ENTIRELY WRONG,
FORMED ON MISTAKEN GROUNDS, AND THAT BY REQUIRING HER
LONGER CONTINUANCE IN LONDON IT DEPRIVED HER OF THE ONLY
POSSIBLE ALLEVIATION OF HER WRETCHEDNESS, THE PERSONAL
SYMPATHY OF HER MOTHER, AND DOOMED HER TO SUCH SOCIETY AND
SUCH SCENES AS MUST PREVENT HER EVER KNOWING A MOMENT'S REST.

BUT IT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT CONSOLATION TO HER,
THAT WHAT BROUGHT EVIL TO HERSELF WOULD BRING GOOD TO
HER SISTER; AND ELINOR, ON THE OTHER HAND, SUSPECTING THAT
IT WOULD NOT BE IN HER POWER TO AVOID EDWARD ENTIRELY,
COMFORTED HERSELF BY THINKING, THAT THOUGH THEIR LONGER
STAY WOULD THEREFORE MILITATE AGAINST HER OWN HAPPINESS,
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MARIANNE THAN AN IMMEDIATE RETURN
INTO DEVONSHIRE.

HER CAREFULNESS IN GUARDING HER SISTER FROM EVER
HEARING WILLOUGHBY'S NAME MENTIONED, WAS NOT THROWN AWAY.
MARIANNE, THOUGH WITHOUT KNOWING IT HERSELF, REAPED ALL
ITS ADVANTAGE; FOR NEITHER MRS. JENNINGS, NOR SIR JOHN,
NOR EVEN MRS. PALMER HERSELF, EVER SPOKE OF HIM BEFORE HER.
ELINOR WISHED THAT THE SAME FORBEARANCE COULD HAVE EXTENDED
TOWARDS HERSELF, BUT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, AND SHE WAS
OBLIGED TO LISTEN DAY AFTER DAY TO THE INDIGNATION OF THEM ALL.

SIR JOHN, COULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE.
"A MAN OF WHOM HE HAD ALWAYS HAD SUCH REASON TO THINK WELL!
SUCH A GOOD-NATURED FELLOW!  HE DID NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A
BOLDER RIDER IN ENGLAND!  IT WAS AN UNACCOUNTABLE BUSINESS.
HE WISHED HIM AT THE DEVIL WITH ALL HIS HEART.  HE WOULD
NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD TO HIM, MEET HIM WHERE HE MIGHT,
FOR ALL THE WORLD!  NO, NOT IF IT WERE TO BE BY THE SIDE
OF BARTON COVERT, AND THEY WERE KEPT WATCHING FOR TWO
HOURS TOGETHER.  SUCH A SCOUNDREL OF A FELLOW! SUCH
A DECEITFUL DOG!  IT WAS ONLY THE LAST TIME THEY MET
THAT HE HAD OFFERED HIM ONE OF FOLLY'S PUPPIES! AND THIS
WAS THE END OF IT!"

MRS. PALMER, IN HER WAY, WAS EQUALLY ANGRY.
"SHE WAS DETERMINED TO DROP HIS ACQUAINTANCE IMMEDIATELY,
AND SHE WAS VERY THANKFUL THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ACQUAINTED
WITH HIM AT ALL.  SHE WISHED WITH ALL HER HEART COMBE
MAGNA WAS NOT SO NEAR CLEVELAND; BUT IT DID NOT SIGNIFY,
FOR IT WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO FAR OFF TO VISIT; SHE HATED
HIM SO MUCH THAT SHE WAS RESOLVED NEVER TO MENTION
HIS NAME AGAIN, AND SHE SHOULD TELL EVERYBODY SHE SAW,
HOW GOOD-FOR-NOTHING HE WAS."

THE REST OF MRS. PALMER'S SYMPATHY WAS SHEWN IN PROCURING
ALL THE PARTICULARS IN HER POWER OF THE APPROACHING MARRIAGE,
AND COMMUNICATING THEM TO ELINOR.  SHE COULD SOON TELL
AT WHAT COACHMAKER'S THE NEW CARRIAGE WAS BUILDING,
BY WHAT PAINTER MR. WILLOUGHBY'S PORTRAIT WAS DRAWN,
AND AT WHAT WAREHOUSE MISS GREY'S CLOTHES MIGHT BE SEEN.

THE CALM AND POLITE UNCONCERN OF LADY MIDDLETON
ON THE OCCASION WAS A HAPPY RELIEF TO ELINOR'S SPIRITS,
OPPRESSED AS THEY OFTEN WERE BY THE CLAMOROUS KINDNESS
OF THE OTHERS.  IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HER TO BE SURE
OF EXCITING NO INTEREST IN ONE PERSON AT LEAST AMONG THEIR
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS: A GREAT COMFORT TO KNOW THAT THERE
WAS ONE WHO WOULD MEET HER WITHOUT FEELING ANY CURIOSITY
AFTER PARTICULARS, OR ANY ANXIETY FOR HER SISTER'S HEALTH.

EVERY QUALIFICATION IS RAISED AT TIMES, BY THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MOMENT, TO MORE THAN ITS REAL VALUE;
AND SHE WAS SOMETIMES WORRIED DOWN BY OFFICIOUS CONDOLENCE
TO RATE GOOD-BREEDING AS MORE INDISPENSABLE TO COMFORT
THAN GOOD-NATURE.

LADY MIDDLETON EXPRESSED HER SENSE OF THE AFFAIR
ABOUT ONCE EVERY DAY, OR TWICE, IF THE SUBJECT OCCURRED
VERY OFTEN, BY SAYING, "IT IS VERY SHOCKING, INDEED!"
AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS CONTINUAL THOUGH GENTLE VENT,
WAS ABLE NOT ONLY TO SEE THE MISS DASHWOODS FROM THE
FIRST WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EMOTION, BUT VERY SOON
TO SEE THEM WITHOUT RECOLLECTING A WORD OF THE MATTER;
AND HAVING THUS SUPPORTED THE DIGNITY OF HER OWN SEX,
AND SPOKEN HER DECIDED CENSURE OF WHAT WAS WRONG
IN THE OTHER, SHE THOUGHT HERSELF AT LIBERTY TO ATTEND
TO THE INTEREST OF HER OWN ASSEMBLIES, AND THEREFORE
DETERMINED (THOUGH RATHER AGAINST THE OPINION OF SIR JOHN)
THAT AS MRS. WILLOUGHBY WOULD AT ONCE BE A WOMAN OF ELEGANCE
AND FORTUNE, TO LEAVE HER CARD WITH HER AS SOON AS SHE MARRIED.

COLONEL BRANDON'S DELICATE, UNOBTRUSIVE ENQUIRIES
WERE NEVER UNWELCOME TO MISS DASHWOOD.  HE HAD ABUNDANTLY
EARNED THE PRIVILEGE OF INTIMATE DISCUSSION OF HER
SISTER'S DISAPPOINTMENT, BY THE FRIENDLY ZEAL WITH
WHICH HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO SOFTEN IT, AND THEY ALWAYS
CONVERSED WITH CONFIDENCE.  HIS CHIEF REWARD FOR THE
PAINFUL EXERTION OF DISCLOSING PAST SORROWS AND PRESENT
HUMILIATIONS, WAS GIVEN IN THE PITYING EYE WITH WHICH
MARIANNE SOMETIMES OBSERVED HIM, AND THE GENTLENESS
OF HER VOICE WHENEVER (THOUGH IT DID NOT OFTEN HAPPEN)
SHE WAS OBLIGED, OR COULD OBLIGE HERSELF TO SPEAK TO HIM.
THESE ASSURED HIM THAT HIS EXERTION HAD PRODUCED AN
INCREASE OF GOOD-WILL TOWARDS HIMSELF, AND THESE GAVE
ELINOR HOPES OF ITS BEING FARTHER AUGMENTED HEREAFTER;
BUT MRS. JENNINGS, WHO KNEW NOTHING OF ALL THIS, WHO KNEW
ONLY THAT THE COLONEL CONTINUED AS GRAVE AS EVER, AND THAT
SHE COULD NEITHER PREVAIL ON HIM TO MAKE THE OFFER HIMSELF,
NOR COMMISSION HER TO MAKE IT FOR HIM, BEGAN, AT THE
END OF TWO DAYS, TO THINK THAT, INSTEAD OF MIDSUMMER,
THEY WOULD NOT BE MARRIED TILL MICHAELMAS, AND BY THE
END OF A WEEK THAT IT WOULD NOT BE A MATCH AT ALL.
THE GOOD UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE COLONEL AND MISS
DASHWOOD SEEMED RATHER TO DECLARE THAT THE HONOURS
OF THE MULBERRY-TREE, THE CANAL, AND THE YEW ARBOUR,
WOULD ALL BE MADE OVER TO HER; AND MRS. JENNINGS HAD,
FOR SOME TIME CEASED TO THINK AT ALL OF MRS. FERRARS.

EARLY IN FEBRUARY, WITHIN A FORTNIGHT FROM THE
RECEIPT OF WILLOUGHBY'S LETTER, ELINOR HAD THE PAINFUL
OFFICE OF INFORMING HER SISTER THAT HE WAS MARRIED.
SHE HAD TAKEN CARE TO HAVE THE INTELLIGENCE CONVEYED
TO HERSELF, AS SOON AS IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE CEREMONY
WAS OVER, AS SHE WAS DESIROUS THAT MARIANNE SHOULD NOT
RECEIVE THE FIRST NOTICE OF IT FROM THE PUBLIC PAPERS,
WHICH SHE SAW HER EAGERLY EXAMINING EVERY MORNING.

SHE RECEIVED THE NEWS WITH RESOLUTE COMPOSURE;
MADE NO OBSERVATION ON IT, AND AT FIRST SHED NO TEARS;
BUT AFTER A SHORT TIME THEY WOULD BURST OUT, AND FOR THE
REST OF THE DAY, SHE WAS IN A STATE HARDLY LESS PITIABLE
THAN WHEN SHE FIRST LEARNT TO EXPECT THE EVENT.

THE WILLOUGHBYS LEFT TOWN AS SOON AS THEY WERE MARRIED;
AND ELINOR NOW HOPED, AS THERE COULD BE NO DANGER
OF HER SEEING EITHER OF THEM, TO PREVAIL ON HER SISTER,
WHO HAD NEVER YET LEFT THE HOUSE SINCE THE BLOW FIRST FELL,
TO GO OUT AGAIN BY DEGREES AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE.

ABOUT THIS TIME THE TWO MISS STEELES, LATELY ARRIVED
AT THEIR COUSIN'S HOUSE IN BARTLETT'S BUILDINGS,
HOLBURN, PRESENTED THEMSELVES AGAIN BEFORE THEIR MORE
GRAND RELATIONS IN CONDUIT AND BERKELEY STREETS;
AND WERE WELCOMED BY THEM ALL WITH GREAT CORDIALITY.

ELINOR ONLY WAS SORRY TO SEE THEM.  THEIR PRESENCE
ALWAYS GAVE HER PAIN, AND SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO MAKE
A VERY GRACIOUS RETURN TO THE OVERPOWERING DELIGHT OF LUCY
IN FINDING HER STILL IN TOWN.

"I SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE DISAPPOINTED IF I HAD NOT
FOUND YOU HERE STILL," SAID SHE REPEATEDLY, WITH A STRONG
EMPHASIS ON THE WORD.  "BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT I SHOULD.
I WAS ALMOST SURE YOU WOULD NOT LEAVE LONDON YET AWHILE;
THOUGH YOU TOLD ME, YOU KNOW, AT BARTON, THAT YOU SHOULD
NOT STAY ABOVE A MONTH.  BUT I THOUGHT, AT THE TIME,
THAT YOU WOULD MOST LIKELY CHANGE YOUR MIND WHEN IT CAME
TO THE POINT.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A GREAT PITY
TO HAVE WENT AWAY BEFORE YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER CAME.
AND NOW TO BE SURE YOU WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO BE GONE.
I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD YOU DID NOT KEEP TO YOUR WORD."

ELINOR PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD HER, AND WAS FORCED
TO USE ALL HER SELF-COMMAND TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT SHE
DID NOT.

"WELL, MY DEAR," SAID MRS. JENNINGS, "AND HOW DID
YOU TRAVEL?"

"NOT IN THE STAGE, I ASSURE YOU," REPLIED MISS STEELE,
WITH QUICK EXULTATION; "WE CAME POST ALL THE WAY, AND HAD
A VERY SMART BEAU TO ATTEND US.  DR. DAVIES WAS COMING
TO TOWN, AND SO WE THOUGHT WE'D JOIN HIM IN A POST-CHAISE;
AND HE BEHAVED VERY GENTEELLY, AND PAID TEN OR TWELVE
SHILLINGS MORE THAN WE DID."

"OH, OH!" CRIED MRS. JENNINGS; "VERY PRETTY,
INDEED! AND THE DOCTOR IS A SINGLE MAN, I WARRANT YOU."

"THERE NOW," SAID MISS STEELE, AFFECTEDLY SIMPERING,
"EVERYBODY LAUGHS AT ME SO ABOUT THE DOCTOR, AND I
CANNOT THINK WHY.  MY COUSINS SAY THEY ARE SURE I HAVE
MADE A CONQUEST; BUT FOR MY PART I DECLARE I NEVER THINK
ABOUT HIM FROM ONE HOUR'S END TO ANOTHER.  'LORD! HERE
COMES YOUR BEAU, NANCY,' MY COUSIN SAID T'OTHER DAY,
WHEN SHE SAW HIM CROSSING THE STREET TO THE HOUSE.
MY BEAU, INDEED! SAID I--I CANNOT THINK WHO YOU MEAN.
THE DOCTOR IS NO BEAU OF MINE."

"AYE, AYE, THAT IS VERY PRETTY TALKING--BUT IT WON'T DO--
THE DOCTOR IS THE MAN, I SEE."

"NO, INDEED!" REPLIED HER COUSIN, WITH AFFECTED EARNESTNESS,
"AND I BEG YOU WILL CONTRADICT IT, IF YOU EVER HEAR IT TALKED
OF."

MRS. JENNINGS DIRECTLY GAVE HER THE GRATIFYING
ASSURANCE THAT SHE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT, AND MISS STEELE
WAS MADE COMPLETELY HAPPY.

"I SUPPOSE YOU WILL GO AND STAY WITH YOUR BROTHER
AND SISTER, MISS DASHWOOD, WHEN THEY COME TO TOWN,"
SAID LUCY, RETURNING, AFTER A CESSATION OF HOSTILE HINTS,
TO THE CHARGE.

"NO, I DO NOT THINK WE SHALL."

"OH, YES, I DARE SAY YOU WILL."

ELINOR WOULD NOT HUMOUR HER BY FARTHER OPPOSITION.

"WHAT A CHARMING THING IT IS THAT MRS. DASHWOOD CAN
SPARE YOU BOTH FOR SO LONG A TIME TOGETHER!"

"LONG A TIME, INDEED!" INTERPOSED MRS. JENNINGS.
"WHY, THEIR VISIT IS BUT JUST BEGUN!"

LUCY WAS SILENCED.

"I AM SORRY WE CANNOT SEE YOUR SISTER, MISS DASHWOOD,"
SAID MISS STEELE.  "I AM SORRY SHE IS NOT WELL--"
FOR MARIANNE HAD LEFT THE ROOM ON THEIR ARRIVAL.

"YOU ARE VERY GOOD.  MY SISTER WILL BE EQUALLY
SORRY TO MISS THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU; BUT SHE HAS
BEEN VERY MUCH PLAGUED LATELY WITH NERVOUS HEAD-ACHES,
WHICH MAKE HER UNFIT FOR COMPANY OR CONVERSATION."

"OH, DEAR, THAT IS A GREAT PITY! BUT SUCH OLD
FRIENDS AS LUCY AND ME!--I THINK SHE MIGHT SEE US;
AND I AM SURE WE WOULD NOT SPEAK A WORD."

ELINOR, WITH GREAT CIVILITY, DECLINED THE PROPOSAL.
HER SISTER WAS PERHAPS LAID DOWN UPON THE BED, OR IN HER
DRESSING GOWN, AND THEREFORE NOT ABLE TO COME TO THEM.

"OH, IF THAT'S ALL," CRIED MISS STEELE, "WE CAN
JUST AS WELL GO AND SEE HER."

ELINOR BEGAN TO FIND THIS IMPERTINENCE TOO MUCH FOR
HER TEMPER; BUT SHE WAS SAVED THE TROUBLE OF CHECKING IT,
BY LUCY'S SHARP REPRIMAND, WHICH NOW, AS ON MANY OCCASIONS,
THOUGH IT DID NOT GIVE MUCH SWEETNESS TO THE MANNERS
OF ONE SISTER, WAS OF ADVANTAGE IN GOVERNING THOSE OF
THE OTHER.



CHAPTER 33


AFTER SOME OPPOSITION, MARIANNE YIELDED TO HER
SISTER'S ENTREATIES, AND CONSENTED TO GO OUT WITH HER
AND MRS. JENNINGS ONE MORNING FOR HALF AN HOUR. SHE
EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED, HOWEVER, FOR PAYING NO VISITS,
AND WOULD DO NO MORE THAN ACCOMPANY THEM TO GRAY'S IN
SACKVILLE STREET, WHERE ELINOR WAS CARRYING ON A NEGOTIATION
FOR THE EXCHANGE OF A FEW OLD-FASHIONED JEWELS OF HER MOTHER.

WHEN THEY STOPPED AT THE DOOR, MRS. JENNINGS RECOLLECTED
THAT THERE WAS A LADY AT THE OTHER END OF THE STREET
ON WHOM SHE OUGHT TO CALL; AND AS SHE HAD NO BUSINESS
AT GRAY'S, IT WAS RESOLVED, THAT WHILE HER YOUNG FRIENDS
TRANSACTED THEIR'S, SHE SHOULD PAY HER VISIT AND
RETURN FOR THEM.

ON ASCENDING THE STAIRS, THE MISS DASHWOODS FOUND
SO MANY PEOPLE BEFORE THEM IN THE ROOM, THAT THERE WAS
NOT A PERSON AT LIBERTY TO TEND TO THEIR ORDERS; AND THEY
WERE OBLIGED TO WAIT.  ALL THAT COULD BE DONE WAS, TO SIT
DOWN AT THAT END OF THE COUNTER WHICH SEEMED TO PROMISE THE
QUICKEST SUCCESSION; ONE GENTLEMAN ONLY WAS STANDING THERE,
AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT ELINOR WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPE
OF EXCITING HIS POLITENESS TO A QUICKER DESPATCH.
BUT THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS EYE, AND THE DELICACY
OF HIS TASTE, PROVED TO BE BEYOND HIS POLITENESS.
HE WAS GIVING ORDERS FOR A TOOTHPICK-CASE FOR HIMSELF,
AND TILL ITS SIZE, SHAPE, AND ORNAMENTS WERE DETERMINED,
ALL OF WHICH, AFTER EXAMINING AND DEBATING FOR A QUARTER
OF AN HOUR OVER EVERY TOOTHPICK-CASE IN THE SHOP,
WERE FINALLY ARRANGED BY HIS OWN INVENTIVE FANCY, HE HAD
NO LEISURE TO BESTOW ANY OTHER ATTENTION ON THE TWO LADIES,
THAN WHAT WAS COMPRISED IN THREE OR FOUR VERY BROAD STARES;
A KIND OF NOTICE WHICH SERVED TO IMPRINT ON ELINOR
THE REMEMBRANCE OF A PERSON AND FACE, OF STRONG,
NATURAL, STERLING INSIGNIFICANCE, THOUGH ADORNED IN
THE FIRST STYLE OF FASHION.

MARIANNE WAS SPARED FROM THE TROUBLESOME FEELINGS
OF CONTEMPT AND RESENTMENT, ON THIS IMPERTINENT EXAMINATION
OF THEIR FEATURES, AND ON THE PUPPYISM OF HIS MANNER
IN DECIDING ON ALL THE DIFFERENT HORRORS OF THE DIFFERENT
TOOTHPICK-CASES PRESENTED TO HIS INSPECTION, BY REMAINING
UNCONSCIOUS OF IT ALL; FOR SHE WAS AS WELL ABLE TO COLLECT
HER THOUGHTS WITHIN HERSELF, AND BE AS IGNORANT OF WHAT WAS
PASSING AROUND HER, IN MR. GRAY'S SHOP, AS IN HER OWN BEDROOM.

AT LAST THE AFFAIR WAS DECIDED.  THE IVORY,
THE GOLD, AND THE PEARLS, ALL RECEIVED THEIR APPOINTMENT,
AND THE GENTLEMAN HAVING NAMED THE LAST DAY ON WHICH HIS
EXISTENCE COULD BE CONTINUED WITHOUT THE POSSESSION OF THE
TOOTHPICK-CASE, DREW ON HIS GLOVES WITH LEISURELY CARE,
AND BESTOWING ANOTHER GLANCE ON THE MISS DASHWOODS, BUT SUCH
A ONE AS SEEMED RATHER TO DEMAND THAN EXPRESS ADMIRATION,
WALKED OFF WITH A HAPPY AIR OF REAL CONCEIT AND AFFECTED
INDIFFERENCE.

ELINOR LOST NO TIME IN BRINGING HER BUSINESS FORWARD,
WAS ON THE POINT OF CONCLUDING IT, WHEN ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
PRESENTED HIMSELF AT HER SIDE.  SHE TURNED HER EYES TOWARDS
HIS FACE, AND FOUND HIM WITH SOME SURPRISE TO BE HER BROTHER.

THEIR AFFECTION AND PLEASURE IN MEETING WAS JUST ENOUGH
TO MAKE A VERY CREDITABLE APPEARANCE IN MR. GRAY'S SHOP.
JOHN DASHWOOD WAS REALLY FAR FROM BEING SORRY TO SEE
HIS SISTERS AGAIN; IT RATHER GAVE THEM SATISFACTION;
AND HIS INQUIRIES AFTER THEIR MOTHER WERE RESPECTFUL
AND ATTENTIVE.

ELINOR FOUND THAT HE AND FANNY HAD BEEN IN TOWN
TWO DAYS.

"I WISHED VERY MUCH TO CALL UPON YOU YESTERDAY,"
SAID HE, "BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, FOR WE WERE OBLIGED
TO TAKE HARRY TO SEE THE WILD BEASTS AT EXETER EXCHANGE;
AND WE SPENT THE REST OF THE DAY WITH MRS. FERRARS.
HARRY WAS VASTLY PLEASED.  THIS MORNING I HAD FULLY INTENDED
TO CALL ON YOU, IF I COULD POSSIBLY FIND A SPARE HALF HOUR,
BUT ONE HAS ALWAYS SO MUCH TO DO ON FIRST COMING TO TOWN.
I AM COME HERE TO BESPEAK FANNY A SEAL.  BUT TOMORROW I
THINK I SHALL CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO CALL IN BERKELEY STREET,
AND BE INTRODUCED TO YOUR FRIEND MRS. JENNINGS.
I UNDERSTAND SHE IS A WOMAN OF VERY GOOD FORTUNE.
AND THE MIDDLETONS TOO, YOU MUST INTRODUCE ME TO THEM.
AS MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S RELATIONS, I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SHOW
THEM EVERY RESPECT.  THEY ARE EXCELLENT NEIGHBOURS TO YOU IN
THE COUNTRY, I UNDERSTAND."

"EXCELLENT INDEED.  THEIR ATTENTION TO OUR COMFORT,
THEIR FRIENDLINESS IN EVERY PARTICULAR, IS MORE THAN I
CAN EXPRESS."

"I AM EXTREMELY GLAD TO HEAR IT, UPON MY WORD;
EXTREMELY GLAD INDEED.  BUT SO IT OUGHT TO BE; THEY ARE
PEOPLE OF LARGE FORTUNE, THEY ARE RELATED TO YOU, AND
EVERY CIVILITY AND ACCOMMODATION THAT CAN SERVE TO MAKE
YOUR SITUATION PLEASANT MIGHT BE REASONABLY EXPECTED.
AND SO YOU ARE MOST COMFORTABLY SETTLED IN YOUR LITTLE COTTAGE
AND WANT FOR NOTHING!  EDWARD BROUGHT US A MOST CHARMING
ACCOUNT OF THE PLACE: THE MOST COMPLETE THING OF ITS KIND,
HE SAID, THAT EVER WAS, AND YOU ALL SEEMED TO ENJOY IT BEYOND
ANY THING.  IT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION TO US TO HEAR IT,
I ASSURE YOU."

ELINOR DID FEEL A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HER BROTHER;
AND WAS NOT SORRY TO BE SPARED THE NECESSITY OF ANSWERING HIM,
BY THE ARRIVAL OF MRS. JENNINGS'S SERVANT, WHO CAME TO TELL
HER THAT HIS MISTRESS WAITED FOR THEM AT THE DOOR.

MR. DASHWOOD ATTENDED THEM DOWN STAIRS, WAS INTRODUCED
TO MRS. JENNINGS AT THE DOOR OF HER CARRIAGE, AND REPEATING
HIS HOPE OF BEING ABLE TO CALL ON THEM THE NEXT DAY,
TOOK LEAVE.

HIS VISIT WAS DULY PAID.  HE CAME WITH A PRETENCE AT
AN APOLOGY FROM THEIR SISTER-IN-LAW, FOR NOT COMING TOO;
"BUT SHE WAS SO MUCH ENGAGED WITH HER MOTHER, THAT REALLY
SHE HAD NO LEISURE FOR GOING ANY WHERE."  MRS. JENNINGS,
HOWEVER, ASSURED HIM DIRECTLY, THAT SHE SHOULD NOT STAND
UPON CEREMONY, FOR THEY WERE ALL COUSINS, OR SOMETHING
LIKE IT, AND SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY WAIT ON MRS. JOHN
DASHWOOD VERY SOON, AND BRING HER SISTERS TO SEE HER.
HIS MANNERS TO THEM, THOUGH CALM, WERE PERFECTLY KIND;
TO MRS. JENNINGS, MOST ATTENTIVELY CIVIL; AND ON COLONEL
BRANDON'S COMING IN SOON AFTER HIMSELF, HE EYED HIM WITH A
CURIOSITY WHICH SEEMED TO SAY, THAT HE ONLY WANTED TO KNOW
HIM TO BE RICH, TO BE EQUALLY CIVIL TO HIM.

AFTER STAYING WITH THEM HALF AN HOUR, HE ASKED
ELINOR TO WALK WITH HIM TO CONDUIT STREET, AND INTRODUCE
HIM TO SIR JOHN AND LADY MIDDLETON.  THE WEATHER WAS
REMARKABLY FINE, AND SHE READILY CONSENTED.  AS SOON
AS THEY WERE OUT OF THE HOUSE, HIS ENQUIRIES BEGAN.

"WHO IS COLONEL BRANDON?  IS HE A MAN OF FORTUNE?"

"YES; HE HAS VERY GOOD PROPERTY IN DORSETSHIRE."

"I AM GLAD OF IT.  HE SEEMS A MOST GENTLEMANLIKE MAN;
AND I THINK, ELINOR, I MAY CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE PROSPECT
OF A VERY RESPECTABLE ESTABLISHMENT IN LIFE."

"ME, BROTHER! WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

"HE LIKES YOU.  I OBSERVED HIM NARROWLY, AND AM
CONVINCED OF IT.  WHAT IS THE AMOUNT OF HIS FORTUNE?"

"I BELIEVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND A YEAR."

"TWO THOUSAND A-YEAR;" AND THEN WORKING HIMSELF
UP TO A PITCH OF ENTHUSIASTIC GENEROSITY, HE ADDED,
"ELINOR, I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART IT WERE TWICE AS MUCH,
FOR YOUR SAKE."

"INDEED I BELIEVE YOU," REPLIED ELINOR; "BUT I AM
VERY SURE THAT COLONEL BRANDON HAS NOT THE SMALLEST WISH
OF MARRYING ME."

"YOU ARE MISTAKEN, ELINOR; YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN.
A VERY LITTLE TROUBLE ON YOUR SIDE SECURES HIM.
PERHAPS JUST AT PRESENT HE MAY BE UNDECIDED; THE SMALLNESS
OF YOUR FORTUNE MAY MAKE HIM HANG BACK; HIS FRIENDS
MAY ALL ADVISE HIM AGAINST IT.  BUT SOME OF THOSE LITTLE
ATTENTIONS AND ENCOURAGEMENTS WHICH LADIES CAN SO EASILY
GIVE WILL FIX HIM, IN SPITE OF HIMSELF.  AND THERE CAN BE
NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT TRY FOR HIM.  IT IS NOT TO BE
SUPPOSED THAT ANY PRIOR ATTACHMENT ON YOUR SIDE--IN SHORT,
YOU KNOW AS TO AN ATTACHMENT OF THAT KIND, IT IS QUITE
OUT OF THE QUESTION, THE OBJECTIONS ARE INSURMOUNTABLE--
YOU HAVE TOO MUCH SENSE NOT TO SEE ALL THAT.  COLONEL BRANDON
MUST BE THE MAN; AND NO CIVILITY SHALL BE WANTING ON
MY PART TO MAKE HIM PLEASED WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
IT IS A MATCH THAT MUST GIVE UNIVERSAL SATISFACTION.
IN SHORT, IT IS A KIND OF THING THAT"--LOWERING HIS VOICE
TO AN IMPORTANT WHISPER--"WILL BE EXCEEDINGLY WELCOME
TO ALL PARTIES." RECOLLECTING HIMSELF, HOWEVER, HE ADDED,
"THAT IS, I MEAN TO SAY--YOUR FRIENDS ARE ALL TRULY
ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU WELL SETTLED; FANNY PARTICULARLY,
FOR SHE HAS YOUR INTEREST VERY MUCH AT HEART, I ASSURE YOU.
AND HER MOTHER TOO, MRS. FERRARS, A VERY GOOD-NATURED WOMAN,
I AM SURE IT WOULD GIVE HER GREAT PLEASURE; SHE SAID AS MUCH
THE OTHER DAY."

ELINOR WOULD NOT VOUCHSAFE ANY ANSWER.

"IT WOULD BE SOMETHING REMARKABLE, NOW," HE CONTINUED,
"SOMETHING DROLL, IF FANNY SHOULD HAVE A BROTHER AND I
A SISTER SETTLING AT THE SAME TIME.  AND YET IT IS NOT
VERY UNLIKELY."

"IS MR. EDWARD FERRARS," SAID ELINOR, WITH RESOLUTION,
"GOING TO BE MARRIED?"

"IT IS NOT ACTUALLY SETTLED, BUT THERE IS SUCH
A THING IN AGITATION.  HE HAS A MOST EXCELLENT MOTHER.
MRS. FERRARS, WITH THE UTMOST LIBERALITY, WILL COME FORWARD,
AND SETTLE ON HIM A THOUSAND A YEAR, IF THE MATCH
TAKES PLACE.  THE LADY IS THE HON. MISS MORTON, ONLY DAUGHTER
OF THE LATE LORD MORTON, WITH THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS.
A VERY DESIRABLE CONNECTION ON BOTH SIDES, AND I HAVE NOT
A DOUBT OF ITS TAKING PLACE IN TIME.  A THOUSAND A-YEAR
IS A GREAT DEAL FOR A MOTHER TO GIVE AWAY, TO MAKE OVER
FOR EVER; BUT MRS. FERRARS HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT.  TO GIVE
YOU ANOTHER INSTANCE OF HER LIBERALITY:--THE OTHER DAY,
AS SOON AS WE CAME TO TOWN, AWARE THAT MONEY COULD
NOT BE VERY PLENTY WITH US JUST NOW, SHE PUT BANK-NOTES
INTO FANNY'S HANDS TO THE AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS.
AND EXTREMELY ACCEPTABLE IT IS, FOR WE MUST LIVE AT A GREAT
EXPENSE WHILE WE ARE HERE."

HE PAUSED FOR HER ASSENT AND COMPASSION; AND SHE
FORCED HERSELF TO SAY,

"YOUR EXPENSES BOTH IN TOWN AND COUNTRY MUST CERTAINLY
BE CONSIDERABLE; BUT YOUR INCOME IS A LARGE ONE."

"NOT SO LARGE, I DARE SAY, AS MANY PEOPLE SUPPOSE.
I DO NOT MEAN TO COMPLAIN, HOWEVER; IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY
A COMFORTABLE ONE, AND I HOPE WILL IN TIME BE BETTER.
THE ENCLOSURE OF NORLAND COMMON, NOW CARRYING ON,
IS A MOST SERIOUS DRAIN.  AND THEN I HAVE MADE A LITTLE
PURCHASE WITHIN THIS HALF YEAR; EAST KINGHAM FARM,
YOU MUST REMEMBER THE PLACE, WHERE OLD GIBSON USED TO LIVE.
THE LAND WAS SO VERY DESIRABLE FOR ME IN EVERY RESPECT,
SO IMMEDIATELY ADJOINING MY OWN PROPERTY, THAT I FELT IT
MY DUTY TO BUY IT.  I COULD NOT HAVE ANSWERED IT TO MY
CONSCIENCE TO LET IT FALL INTO ANY OTHER HANDS.  A MAN MUST
PAY FOR HIS CONVENIENCE; AND IT HAS COST ME A VAST DEAL
OF MONEY."

"MORE THAN YOU THINK IT REALLY AND INTRINSICALLY WORTH."

"WHY, I HOPE NOT THAT.  I MIGHT HAVE SOLD IT AGAIN,
THE NEXT DAY, FOR MORE THAN I GAVE: BUT, WITH REGARD TO THE
PURCHASE-MONEY, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY UNFORTUNATE INDEED;
FOR THE STOCKS WERE AT THAT TIME SO LOW, THAT IF I HAD NOT
HAPPENED TO HAVE THE NECESSARY SUM IN MY BANKER'S HANDS,
I MUST HAVE SOLD OUT TO VERY GREAT LOSS."

ELINOR COULD ONLY SMILE.

"OTHER GREAT AND INEVITABLE EXPENSES TOO WE HAVE
HAD ON FIRST COMING TO NORLAND.  OUR RESPECTED FATHER,
AS YOU WELL KNOW, BEQUEATHED ALL THE STANHILL EFFECTS
THAT REMAINED AT NORLAND (AND VERY VALUABLE THEY WERE)
TO YOUR MOTHER.  FAR BE IT FROM ME TO REPINE AT HIS
DOING SO; HE HAD AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF HIS
OWN PROPERTY AS HE CHOSE, BUT, IN CONSEQUENCE OF IT,
WE HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE LARGE PURCHASES OF LINEN,
CHINA, &C. TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF WHAT WAS TAKEN AWAY.
YOU MAY GUESS, AFTER ALL THESE EXPENSES, HOW VERY FAR WE
MUST BE FROM BEING RICH, AND HOW ACCEPTABLE MRS. FERRARS'S
KINDNESS IS."

"CERTAINLY," SAID ELINOR; "AND ASSISTED BY HER LIBERALITY,
I HOPE YOU MAY YET LIVE TO BE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES."

"ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO MAY DO MUCH TOWARDS IT,"
HE GRAVELY REPLIED; "BUT HOWEVER THERE IS STILL A GREAT
DEAL TO BE DONE.  THERE IS NOT A STONE LAID OF FANNY'S
GREEN-HOUSE, AND NOTHING BUT THE PLAN OF THE FLOWER-GARDEN
MARKED OUT."

"WHERE IS THE GREEN-HOUSE TO BE?"

"UPON THE KNOLL BEHIND THE HOUSE.  THE OLD
WALNUT TREES ARE ALL COME DOWN TO MAKE ROOM FOR IT.
IT WILL BE A VERY FINE OBJECT FROM MANY PARTS OF THE PARK,
AND THE FLOWER-GARDEN WILL SLOPE DOWN JUST BEFORE IT,
AND BE EXCEEDINGLY PRETTY.  WE HAVE CLEARED AWAY ALL THE OLD
THORNS THAT GREW IN PATCHES OVER THE BROW."

ELINOR KEPT HER CONCERN AND HER CENSURE TO HERSELF;
AND WAS VERY THANKFUL THAT MARIANNE WAS NOT PRESENT,
TO SHARE THE PROVOCATION.

HAVING NOW SAID ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS POVERTY CLEAR,
AND TO DO AWAY THE NECESSITY OF BUYING A PAIR OF EAR-RINGS
FOR EACH OF HIS SISTERS, IN HIS NEXT VISIT AT GRAY'S
HIS THOUGHTS TOOK A CHEERFULLER TURN, AND HE BEGAN TO
CONGRATULATE ELINOR ON HAVING SUCH A FRIEND AS MRS. JENNINGS.

"SHE SEEMS A MOST VALUABLE WOMAN INDEED--HER HOUSE,
HER STYLE OF LIVING, ALL BESPEAK AN EXCEEDING GOOD INCOME;
AND IT IS AN ACQUAINTANCE THAT HAS NOT ONLY BEEN
OF GREAT USE TO YOU HITHERTO, BUT IN THE END MAY PROVE
MATERIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS.--HER INVITING YOU TO TOWN IS
CERTAINLY A VAST THING IN YOUR FAVOUR; AND INDEED, IT
SPEAKS ALTOGETHER SO GREAT A REGARD FOR YOU, THAT IN ALL
PROBABILITY WHEN SHE DIES YOU WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN.--
SHE MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO LEAVE."

"NOTHING AT ALL, I SHOULD RATHER SUPPOSE; FOR SHE HAS
ONLY HER JOINTURE, WHICH WILL DESCEND TO HER CHILDREN."

"BUT IT IS NOT TO BE IMAGINED THAT SHE LIVES UP TO
HER INCOME.  FEW PEOPLE OF COMMON PRUDENCE WILL DO THAT;
AND WHATEVER SHE SAVES, SHE WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF."

"AND DO YOU NOT THINK IT MORE LIKELY THAT SHE
SHOULD LEAVE IT TO HER DAUGHTERS, THAN TO US?"

"HER DAUGHTERS ARE BOTH EXCEEDINGLY WELL MARRIED,
AND THEREFORE I CANNOT PERCEIVE THE NECESSITY OF HER
REMEMBERING THEM FARTHER.  WHEREAS, IN MY OPINION, BY HER
TAKING SO MUCH NOTICE OF YOU, AND TREATING YOU IN THIS
KIND OF WAY, SHE HAS GIVEN YOU A SORT OF CLAIM ON HER
FUTURE CONSIDERATION, WHICH A CONSCIENTIOUS WOMAN WOULD
NOT DISREGARD.  NOTHING CAN BE KINDER THAN HER BEHAVIOUR;
AND SHE CAN HARDLY DO ALL THIS, WITHOUT BEING AWARE
OF THE EXPECTATION IT RAISES."

"BUT SHE RAISES NONE IN THOSE MOST CONCERNED.
INDEED, BROTHER, YOUR ANXIETY FOR OUR WELFARE AND PROSPERITY
CARRIES YOU TOO FAR."

"WHY, TO BE SURE," SAID HE, SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF,
"PEOPLE HAVE LITTLE, HAVE VERY LITTLE IN THEIR POWER.
BUT, MY DEAR ELINOR, WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH MARIANNE?--
SHE LOOKS VERY UNWELL, HAS LOST HER COLOUR, AND IS GROWN
QUITE THIN.  IS SHE ILL?"

"SHE IS NOT WELL, SHE HAS HAD A NERVOUS COMPLAINT
ON HER FOR SEVERAL WEEKS."

"I AM SORRY FOR THAT.  AT HER TIME OF LIFE,
ANY THING OF AN ILLNESS DESTROYS THE BLOOM FOR EVER!
HER'S HAS BEEN A VERY SHORT ONE!  SHE WAS AS HANDSOME A GIRL
LAST SEPTEMBER, AS I EVER SAW; AND AS LIKELY TO ATTRACT
THE MAN.  THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER STYLE OF BEAUTY,
TO PLEASE THEM PARTICULARLY.  I REMEMBER FANNY USED TO SAY
THAT SHE WOULD MARRY SOONER AND BETTER THAN YOU DID;
NOT BUT WHAT SHE IS EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF YOU, BUT SO IT
HAPPENED TO STRIKE HER.  SHE WILL BE MISTAKEN, HOWEVER.
I QUESTION WHETHER MARIANNE NOW, WILL MARRY A MAN WORTH
MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED A-YEAR, AT THE UTMOST,
AND I AM VERY MUCH DECEIVED IF YOU DO NOT DO BETTER.
DORSETSHIRE!  I KNOW VERY LITTLE OF DORSETSHIRE; BUT, MY DEAR
ELINOR, I SHALL BE EXCEEDINGLY GLAD TO KNOW MORE OF IT;
AND I THINK I CAN ANSWER FOR YOUR HAVING FANNY AND MYSELF
AMONG THE EARLIEST AND BEST PLEASED OF YOUR VISITORS."

ELINOR TRIED VERY SERIOUSLY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT
THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD OF HER MARRYING COLONEL BRANDON;
BUT IT WAS AN EXPECTATION OF TOO MUCH PLEASURE TO HIMSELF
TO BE RELINQUISHED, AND HE WAS REALLY RESOLVED ON SEEKING
AN INTIMACY WITH THAT GENTLEMAN, AND PROMOTING THE MARRIAGE
BY EVERY POSSIBLE ATTENTION.  HE HAD JUST COMPUNCTION
ENOUGH FOR HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR HIS SISTERS HIMSELF,
TO BE EXCEEDINGLY ANXIOUS THAT EVERYBODY ELSE SHOULD
DO A GREAT DEAL; AND AN OFFER FROM COLONEL BRANDON,
OR A LEGACY FROM MRS. JENNINGS, WAS THE EASIEST MEANS
OF ATONING FOR HIS OWN NEGLECT.

THEY WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND LADY MIDDLETON
AT HOME, AND SIR JOHN CAME IN BEFORE THEIR VISIT ENDED.
ABUNDANCE OF CIVILITIES PASSED ON ALL SIDES.  SIR JOHN
WAS READY TO LIKE ANYBODY, AND THOUGH MR. DASHWOOD DID
NOT SEEM TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT HORSES, HE SOON SET HIM
DOWN AS A VERY GOOD-NATURED FELLOW: WHILE LADY MIDDLETON
SAW ENOUGH OF FASHION IN HIS APPEARANCE TO THINK HIS
ACQUAINTANCE WORTH HAVING; AND MR. DASHWOOD WENT AWAY
DELIGHTED WITH BOTH.

"I SHALL HAVE A CHARMING ACCOUNT TO CARRY
TO FANNY," SAID HE, AS HE WALKED BACK WITH HIS SISTER.
"LADY MIDDLETON IS REALLY A MOST ELEGANT WOMAN!  SUCH
A WOMAN AS I AM SURE FANNY WILL BE GLAD TO KNOW.
AND MRS. JENNINGS TOO, AN EXCEEDINGLY WELL-BEHAVED WOMAN,
THOUGH NOT SO ELEGANT AS HER DAUGHTER.  YOUR SISTER NEED
NOT HAVE ANY SCRUPLE EVEN OF VISITING HER, WHICH, TO SAY
THE TRUTH, HAS BEEN A LITTLE THE CASE, AND VERY NATURALLY;
FOR WE ONLY KNEW THAT MRS. JENNINGS WAS THE WIDOW OF A MAN
WHO HAD GOT ALL HIS MONEY IN A LOW WAY; AND FANNY AND
MRS. FERRARS WERE BOTH STRONGLY PREPOSSESSED, THAT NEITHER
SHE NOR HER DAUGHTERS WERE SUCH KIND OF WOMEN AS FANNY
WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE WITH.  BUT NOW I CAN CARRY HER
A MOST SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT OF BOTH."



CHAPTER 34


MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD HAD SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HER
HUSBAND'S JUDGMENT, THAT SHE WAITED THE VERY NEXT DAY
BOTH ON MRS. JENNINGS AND HER DAUGHTER; AND HER
CONFIDENCE WAS REWARDED BY FINDING EVEN THE FORMER,
EVEN THE WOMAN WITH WHOM HER SISTERS WERE STAYING,
BY NO MEANS UNWORTHY HER NOTICE; AND AS FOR LADY MIDDLETON,
SHE FOUND HER ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING WOMEN IN THE WORLD!

LADY MIDDLETON WAS EQUALLY PLEASED WITH MRS. DASHWOOD.
THERE WAS A KIND OF COLD HEARTED SELFISHNESS ON BOTH SIDES,
WHICH MUTUALLY ATTRACTED THEM; AND THEY SYMPATHISED
WITH EACH OTHER IN AN INSIPID PROPRIETY OF DEMEANOR,
AND A GENERAL WANT OF UNDERSTANDING.

THE SAME MANNERS, HOWEVER, WHICH RECOMMENDED MRS. JOHN
DASHWOOD TO THE GOOD OPINION OF LADY MIDDLETON DID NOT SUIT
THE FANCY OF MRS. JENNINGS, AND TO HER SHE APPEARED NOTHING
MORE THAN A LITTLE PROUD-LOOKING WOMAN OF UNCORDIAL ADDRESS,
WHO MET HER HUSBAND'S SISTERS WITHOUT ANY AFFECTION,
AND ALMOST WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO SAY TO THEM;
FOR OF THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR BESTOWED ON BERKELEY STREET,
SHE SAT AT LEAST SEVEN MINUTES AND A HALF IN SILENCE.

ELINOR WANTED VERY MUCH TO KNOW, THOUGH SHE DID
NOT CHUSE TO ASK, WHETHER EDWARD WAS THEN IN TOWN;
BUT NOTHING WOULD HAVE INDUCED FANNY VOLUNTARILY
TO MENTION HIS NAME BEFORE HER, TILL ABLE TO TELL HER
THAT HIS MARRIAGE WITH MISS MORTON WAS RESOLVED ON,
OR TILL HER HUSBAND'S EXPECTATIONS ON COLONEL BRANDON
WERE ANSWERED; BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED THEM STILL SO VERY
MUCH ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER, THAT THEY COULD NOT BE TOO
SEDULOUSLY DIVIDED IN WORD AND DEED ON EVERY OCCASION.
THE INTELLIGENCE HOWEVER, WHICH SHE WOULD NOT GIVE,
SOON FLOWED FROM ANOTHER QUARTER.  LUCY CAME VERY SHORTLY
TO CLAIM ELINOR'S COMPASSION ON BEING UNABLE TO SEE EDWARD,
THOUGH HE HAD ARRIVED IN TOWN WITH MR. AND MRS. DASHWOOD.
HE DARED NOT COME TO BARTLETT'S BUILDINGS FOR FEAR
OF DETECTION, AND THOUGH THEIR MUTUAL IMPATIENCE TO MEET,
WAS NOT TO BE TOLD, THEY COULD DO NOTHING AT PRESENT
BUT WRITE.

EDWARD ASSURED THEM HIMSELF OF HIS BEING IN TOWN,
WITHIN A VERY SHORT TIME, BY TWICE CALLING IN BERKELEY STREET.
TWICE WAS HIS CARD FOUND ON THE TABLE, WHEN THEY RETURNED
FROM THEIR MORNING'S ENGAGEMENTS.  ELINOR WAS PLEASED
THAT HE HAD CALLED; AND STILL MORE PLEASED THAT SHE HAD
MISSED HIM.

THE DASHWOODS WERE SO PRODIGIOUSLY DELIGHTED
WITH THE MIDDLETONS, THAT, THOUGH NOT MUCH IN THE HABIT
OF GIVING ANYTHING, THEY DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM--
A DINNER; AND SOON AFTER THEIR ACQUAINTANCE BEGAN,
INVITED THEM TO DINE IN HARLEY STREET, WHERE THEY HAD
TAKEN A VERY GOOD HOUSE FOR THREE MONTHS.  THEIR SISTERS
AND MRS. JENNINGS WERE INVITED LIKEWISE, AND JOHN DASHWOOD
WAS CAREFUL TO SECURE COLONEL BRANDON, WHO, ALWAYS GLAD
TO BE WHERE THE MISS DASHWOODS WERE, RECEIVED HIS EAGER
CIVILITIES WITH SOME SURPRISE, BUT MUCH MORE PLEASURE.
THEY WERE TO MEET MRS. FERRARS; BUT ELINOR COULD NOT LEARN
WHETHER HER SONS WERE TO BE OF THE PARTY.  THE EXPECTATION
OF SEEING HER, HOWEVER, WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HER INTERESTED
IN THE ENGAGEMENT; FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOW MEET EDWARD'S
MOTHER WITHOUT THAT STRONG ANXIETY WHICH HAD ONCE PROMISED
TO ATTEND SUCH AN INTRODUCTION, THOUGH SHE COULD NOW SEE
HER WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE AS TO HER OPINION OF HERSELF,
HER DESIRE OF BEING IN COMPANY WITH MRS. FERRARS,
HER CURIOSITY TO KNOW WHAT SHE WAS LIKE, WAS AS LIVELY AS EVER.

THE INTEREST WITH WHICH SHE THUS ANTICIPATED THE
PARTY, WAS SOON AFTERWARDS INCREASED, MORE POWERFULLY
THAN PLEASANTLY, BY HER HEARING THAT THE MISS STEELES
WERE ALSO TO BE AT IT.

SO WELL HAD THEY RECOMMENDED THEMSELVES TO LADY MIDDLETON,
SO AGREEABLE HAD THEIR ASSIDUITIES MADE THEM TO HER,
THAT THOUGH LUCY WAS CERTAINLY NOT SO ELEGANT, AND HER
SISTER NOT EVEN GENTEEL, SHE WAS AS READY AS SIR JOHN
TO ASK THEM TO SPEND A WEEK OR TWO IN CONDUIT STREET;
AND IT HAPPENED TO BE PARTICULARLY CONVENIENT TO THE MISS
STEELES, AS SOON AS THE DASHWOODS' INVITATION WAS KNOWN,
THAT THEIR VISIT SHOULD BEGIN A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE PARTY
TOOK PLACE.

THEIR CLAIMS TO THE NOTICE OF MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD,
AS THE NIECES OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO FOR MANY YEARS HAD
HAD THE CARE OF HER BROTHER, MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE MUCH,
HOWEVER, TOWARDS PROCURING THEM SEATS AT HER TABLE;
BUT AS LADY MIDDLETON'S GUESTS THEY MUST BE WELCOME; AND LUCY,
WHO HAD LONG WANTED TO BE PERSONALLY KNOWN TO THE FAMILY,
TO HAVE A NEARER VIEW OF THEIR CHARACTERS AND HER OWN
DIFFICULTIES, AND TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF ENDEAVOURING
TO PLEASE THEM, HAD SELDOM BEEN HAPPIER IN HER LIFE,
THAN SHE WAS ON RECEIVING MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD'S CARD.

ON ELINOR ITS EFFECT WAS VERY DIFFERENT.  SHE BEGAN
IMMEDIATELY TO DETERMINE, THAT EDWARD WHO LIVED WITH
HIS MOTHER, MUST BE ASKED AS HIS MOTHER WAS, TO A PARTY
GIVEN BY HIS SISTER; AND TO SEE HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME,
AFTER ALL THAT PASSED, IN THE COMPANY OF LUCY!--SHE HARDLY
KNEW HOW SHE COULD BEAR IT!

THESE APPREHENSIONS, PERHAPS, WERE NOT FOUNDED
ENTIRELY ON REASON, AND CERTAINLY NOT AT ALL ON TRUTH.
THEY WERE RELIEVED HOWEVER, NOT BY HER OWN RECOLLECTION,
BUT BY THE GOOD WILL OF LUCY, WHO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE
INFLICTING A SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN SHE TOLD HER
THAT EDWARD CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE IN HARLEY STREET ON TUESDAY,
AND EVEN HOPED TO BE CARRYING THE PAIN STILL FARTHER
BY PERSUADING HER THAT HE WAS KEPT AWAY BY THE EXTREME
AFFECTION FOR HERSELF, WHICH HE COULD NOT CONCEAL WHEN THEY
WERE TOGETHER.

THE IMPORTANT TUESDAY CAME THAT WAS TO INTRODUCE
THE TWO YOUNG LADIES TO THIS FORMIDABLE MOTHER-IN-LAW.

"PITY ME, DEAR MISS DASHWOOD!" SAID LUCY, AS THEY
WALKED UP THE STAIRS TOGETHER--FOR THE MIDDLETONS ARRIVED
SO DIRECTLY AFTER MRS. JENNINGS, THAT THEY ALL FOLLOWED
THE SERVANT AT THE SAME TIME--"THERE IS NOBODY HERE BUT
YOU, THAT CAN FEEL FOR ME.--I DECLARE I CAN HARDLY STAND.
GOOD GRACIOUS!--IN A MOMENT I SHALL SEE THE PERSON THAT ALL
MY HAPPINESS DEPENDS ON--THAT IS TO BE MY MOTHER!"--

ELINOR COULD HAVE GIVEN HER IMMEDIATE RELIEF
BY SUGGESTING THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS BEING MISS MORTON'S MOTHER,
RATHER THAN HER OWN, WHOM THEY WERE ABOUT TO BEHOLD;
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT, SHE ASSURED HER, AND WITH
GREAT SINCERITY, THAT SHE DID PITY HER--TO THE UTTER
AMAZEMENT OF LUCY, WHO, THOUGH REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE HERSELF,
HOPED AT LEAST TO BE AN OBJECT OF IRREPRESSIBLE ENVY TO ELINOR.

MRS. FERRARS WAS A LITTLE, THIN WOMAN, UPRIGHT,
EVEN TO FORMALITY, IN HER FIGURE, AND SERIOUS,
EVEN TO SOURNESS, IN HER ASPECT.  HER COMPLEXION WAS SALLOW;
AND HER FEATURES SMALL, WITHOUT BEAUTY, AND NATURALLY
WITHOUT EXPRESSION; BUT A LUCKY CONTRACTION OF THE BROW
HAD RESCUED HER COUNTENANCE FROM THE DISGRACE OF INSIPIDITY,
BY GIVING IT THE STRONG CHARACTERS OF PRIDE AND ILL NATURE.
SHE WAS NOT A WOMAN OF MANY WORDS; FOR, UNLIKE PEOPLE
IN GENERAL, SHE PROPORTIONED THEM TO THE NUMBER OF
HER IDEAS; AND OF THE FEW SYLLABLES THAT DID ESCAPE HER,
NOT ONE FELL TO THE SHARE OF MISS DASHWOOD, WHOM SHE EYED
WITH THE SPIRITED DETERMINATION OF DISLIKING HER AT ALL EVENTS.

ELINOR COULD NOT NOW BE MADE UNHAPPY BY THIS BEHAVIOUR.--
A FEW MONTHS AGO IT WOULD HAVE HURT HER EXCEEDINGLY; BUT IT
WAS NOT IN MRS. FERRARS' POWER TO DISTRESS HER BY IT NOW;--
AND THE DIFFERENCE OF HER MANNERS TO THE MISS STEELES,
A DIFFERENCE WHICH SEEMED PURPOSELY MADE TO HUMBLE HER MORE,
ONLY AMUSED HER.  SHE COULD NOT BUT SMILE TO SEE THE GRACIOUSNESS
OF BOTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER TOWARDS THE VERY PERSON--
FOR LUCY WAS PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHED--WHOM OF ALL OTHERS,
HAD THEY KNOWN AS MUCH AS SHE DID, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST
ANXIOUS TO MORTIFY; WHILE SHE HERSELF, WHO HAD COMPARATIVELY
NO POWER TO WOUND THEM, SAT POINTEDLY SLIGHTED BY BOTH.
BUT WHILE SHE SMILED AT A GRACIOUSNESS SO MISAPPLIED,
SHE COULD NOT REFLECT ON THE MEAN-SPIRITED FOLLY FROM
WHICH IT SPRUNG, NOR OBSERVE THE STUDIED ATTENTIONS
WITH WHICH THE MISS STEELES COURTED ITS CONTINUANCE,
WITHOUT THOROUGHLY DESPISING THEM ALL FOUR.

LUCY WAS ALL EXULTATION ON BEING SO HONORABLY
DISTINGUISHED; AND MISS STEELE WANTED ONLY TO BE TEAZED
ABOUT DR. DAVIES TO BE PERFECTLY HAPPY.

THE DINNER WAS A GRAND ONE, THE SERVANTS WERE NUMEROUS,
AND EVERY THING BESPOKE THE MISTRESS'S INCLINATION
FOR SHOW, AND THE MASTER'S ABILITY TO SUPPORT IT.
IN SPITE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS AND ADDITIONS WHICH WERE
MAKING TO THE NORLAND ESTATE, AND IN SPITE OF ITS OWNER
HAVING ONCE BEEN WITHIN SOME THOUSAND POUNDS OF BEING
OBLIGED TO SELL OUT AT A LOSS, NOTHING GAVE ANY SYMPTOM
OF THAT INDIGENCE WHICH HE HAD TRIED TO INFER FROM IT;--
NO POVERTY OF ANY KIND, EXCEPT OF CONVERSATION, APPEARED--
BUT THERE, THE DEFICIENCY WAS CONSIDERABLE.  JOHN DASHWOOD
HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY FOR HIMSELF THAT WAS WORTH HEARING,
AND HIS WIFE HAD STILL LESS.  BUT THERE WAS NO PECULIAR
DISGRACE IN THIS; FOR IT WAS VERY MUCH THE CASE WITH
THE CHIEF OF THEIR VISITORS, WHO ALMOST ALL LABOURED
UNDER ONE OR OTHER OF THESE DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR BEING
AGREEABLE--WANT OF SENSE, EITHER NATURAL OR IMPROVED--WANT
OF ELEGANCE--WANT OF SPIRITS--OR WANT OF TEMPER.

WHEN THE LADIES WITHDREW TO THE DRAWING-ROOM
AFTER DINNER, THIS POVERTY WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT,
FOR THE GENTLEMEN HAD SUPPLIED THE DISCOURSE WITH SOME
VARIETY--THE VARIETY OF POLITICS, INCLOSING LAND,
AND BREAKING HORSES--BUT THEN IT WAS ALL OVER; AND ONE
SUBJECT ONLY ENGAGED THE LADIES TILL COFFEE CAME IN,
WHICH WAS THE COMPARATIVE HEIGHTS OF HARRY DASHWOOD,
AND LADY MIDDLETON'S SECOND SON WILLIAM, WHO WERE NEARLY
OF THE SAME AGE.

HAD BOTH THE CHILDREN BEEN THERE, THE AFFAIR MIGHT
HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TOO EASILY BY MEASURING THEM AT ONCE;
BUT AS HARRY ONLY WAS PRESENT, IT WAS ALL CONJECTURAL
ASSERTION ON BOTH SIDES; AND EVERY BODY HAD A RIGHT TO
BE EQUALLY POSITIVE IN THEIR OPINION, AND TO REPEAT IT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS OFTEN AS THEY LIKED.

THE PARTIES STOOD THUS:

THE TWO MOTHERS, THOUGH EACH REALLY CONVINCED THAT
HER OWN SON WAS THE TALLEST, POLITELY DECIDED IN FAVOUR
OF THE OTHER.

THE TWO GRANDMOTHERS, WITH NOT LESS PARTIALITY,
BUT MORE SINCERITY, WERE EQUALLY EARNEST IN SUPPORT
OF THEIR OWN DESCENDANT.

LUCY, WHO WAS HARDLY LESS ANXIOUS TO PLEASE ONE PARENT
THAN THE OTHER, THOUGHT THE BOYS WERE BOTH REMARKABLY TALL
FOR THEIR AGE, AND COULD NOT CONCEIVE THAT THERE COULD
BE THE SMALLEST DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD BETWEEN THEM;
AND MISS STEELE, WITH YET GREATER ADDRESS GAVE IT,
AS FAST AS SHE COULD, IN FAVOUR OF EACH.

ELINOR, HAVING ONCE DELIVERED HER OPINION ON
WILLIAM'S SIDE, BY WHICH SHE OFFENDED MRS. FERRARS AND
FANNY STILL MORE, DID NOT SEE THE NECESSITY OF ENFORCING
IT BY ANY FARTHER ASSERTION; AND MARIANNE, WHEN CALLED
ON FOR HER'S, OFFENDED THEM ALL, BY DECLARING THAT SHE
HAD NO OPINION TO GIVE, AS SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

BEFORE HER REMOVING FROM NORLAND, ELINOR HAD PAINTED
A VERY PRETTY PAIR OF SCREENS FOR HER SISTER-IN-LAW,
WHICH BEING NOW JUST MOUNTED AND BROUGHT HOME,
ORNAMENTED HER PRESENT DRAWING ROOM; AND THESE SCREENS,
CATCHING THE EYE OF JOHN DASHWOOD ON HIS FOLLOWING
THE OTHER GENTLEMEN INTO THE ROOM, WERE OFFICIOUSLY
HANDED BY HIM TO COLONEL BRANDON FOR HIS ADMIRATION.

"THESE ARE DONE BY MY ELDEST SISTER," SAID HE; "AND YOU,
AS A MAN OF TASTE, WILL, I DARE SAY, BE PLEASED WITH THEM.
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE EVER HAPPENED TO SEE ANY
OF HER PERFORMANCES BEFORE, BUT SHE IS IN GENERAL RECKONED
TO DRAW EXTREMELY WELL."

THE COLONEL, THOUGH DISCLAIMING ALL PRETENSIONS
TO CONNOISSEURSHIP, WARMLY ADMIRED THE SCREENS, AS HE
WOULD HAVE DONE ANY THING PAINTED BY MISS DASHWOOD;
AND ON THE CURIOSITY OF THE OTHERS BEING OF COURSE EXCITED,
THEY WERE HANDED ROUND FOR GENERAL INSPECTION.
MRS. FERRARS, NOT AWARE OF THEIR BEING ELINOR'S WORK,
PARTICULARLY REQUESTED TO LOOK AT THEM; AND AFTER THEY HAD
RECEIVED GRATIFYING TESTIMONY OF LADY MIDDLETONS'S APPROBATION,
FANNY PRESENTED THEM TO HER MOTHER, CONSIDERATELY INFORMING
HER, AT THE SAME TIME, THAT THEY WERE DONE BY MISS DASHWOOD.

"HUM"--SAID MRS. FERRARS--"VERY PRETTY,"--AND WITHOUT
REGARDING THEM AT ALL, RETURNED THEM TO HER DAUGHTER.

PERHAPS FANNY THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT HER MOTHER
HAD BEEN QUITE RUDE ENOUGH,--FOR, COLOURING A LITTLE,
SHE IMMEDIATELY SAID,

"THEY ARE VERY PRETTY, MA'AM--AN'T THEY?" BUT THEN AGAIN,
THE DREAD OF HAVING BEEN TOO CIVIL, TOO ENCOURAGING HERSELF,
PROBABLY CAME OVER HER, FOR SHE PRESENTLY ADDED,

"DO YOU NOT THINK THEY ARE SOMETHING IN MISS
MORTON'S STYLE OF PAINTING, MA'AM?--SHE DOES PAINT MOST
DELIGHTFULLY!--HOW BEAUTIFULLY HER LAST LANDSCAPE IS DONE!"

"BEAUTIFULLY INDEED!  BUT SHE DOES EVERY THING WELL."

MARIANNE COULD NOT BEAR THIS.--SHE WAS ALREADY
GREATLY DISPLEASED WITH MRS. FERRARS; AND SUCH ILL-TIMED
PRAISE OF ANOTHER, AT ELINOR'S EXPENSE, THOUGH SHE
HAD NOT ANY NOTION OF WHAT WAS PRINCIPALLY MEANT BY IT,
PROVOKED HER IMMEDIATELY TO SAY WITH WARMTH,

"THIS IS ADMIRATION OF A VERY PARTICULAR KIND!--
WHAT IS MISS MORTON TO US?--WHO KNOWS, OR WHO CARES,
FOR HER?--IT IS ELINOR OF WHOM WE THINK AND SPEAK."

AND SO SAYING, SHE TOOK THE SCREENS OUT OF HER
SISTER-IN-LAW'S HANDS, TO ADMIRE THEM HERSELF AS THEY
OUGHT TO BE ADMIRED.

MRS. FERRARS LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY ANGRY, AND DRAWING
HERSELF UP MORE STIFFLY THAN EVER, PRONOUNCED IN RETORT
THIS BITTER PHILIPPIC, "MISS MORTON IS LORD MORTON'S DAUGHTER."

FANNY LOOKED VERY ANGRY TOO, AND HER HUSBAND WAS
ALL IN A FRIGHT AT HIS SISTER'S AUDACITY.  ELINOR WAS
MUCH MORE HURT BY MARIANNE'S WARMTH THAN SHE HAD BEEN
BY WHAT PRODUCED IT; BUT COLONEL BRANDON'S EYES, AS THEY
WERE FIXED ON MARIANNE, DECLARED THAT HE NOTICED ONLY
WHAT WAS AMIABLE IN IT, THE AFFECTIONATE HEART WHICH COULD
NOT BEAR TO SEE A SISTER SLIGHTED IN THE SMALLEST POINT.

MARIANNE'S FEELINGS DID NOT STOP HERE.  THE COLD
INSOLENCE OF MRS. FERRARS'S GENERAL BEHAVIOUR TO HER SISTER,
SEEMED, TO HER, TO FORETELL SUCH DIFFICULTIES AND DISTRESSES
TO ELINOR, AS HER OWN WOUNDED HEART TAUGHT HER TO THINK
OF WITH HORROR; AND URGED BY A STRONG IMPULSE OF
AFFECTIONATE SENSIBILITY, SHE MOVED AFTER A MOMENT,
TO HER SISTER'S CHAIR, AND PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND HER NECK,
AND ONE CHEEK CLOSE TO HERS, SAID IN A LOW, BUT EAGER,
VOICE,

"DEAR, DEAR ELINOR, DON'T MIND THEM.  DON'T LET THEM
MAKE YOU UNHAPPY."

SHE COULD SAY NO MORE; HER SPIRITS WERE QUITE OVERCOME,
AND HIDING HER FACE ON ELINOR'S SHOULDER, SHE BURST
INTO TEARS.  EVERY BODY'S ATTENTION WAS CALLED, AND ALMOST
EVERY BODY WAS CONCERNED.--COLONEL BRANDON ROSE UP AND WENT
TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE DID.--MRS. JENNINGS,
WITH A VERY INTELLIGENT "AH! POOR DEAR," IMMEDIATELY GAVE
HER HER SALTS; AND SIR JOHN FELT SO DESPERATELY ENRAGED
AGAINST THE AUTHOR OF THIS NERVOUS DISTRESS, THAT HE
INSTANTLY CHANGED HIS SEAT TO ONE CLOSE BY LUCY STEELE,
AND GAVE HER, IN A WHISPER, A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE WHOLE
SHOCKING AFFAIR.

IN A FEW MINUTES, HOWEVER, MARIANNE WAS RECOVERED
ENOUGH TO PUT AN END TO THE BUSTLE, AND SIT DOWN AMONG
THE REST; THOUGH HER SPIRITS RETAINED THE IMPRESSION
OF WHAT HAD PASSED, THE WHOLE EVENING.

"POOR MARIANNE!" SAID HER BROTHER TO COLONEL BRANDON,
IN A LOW VOICE, AS SOON AS HE COULD SECURE HIS ATTENTION,--
"SHE HAS NOT SUCH GOOD HEALTH AS HER SISTER,--SHE IS VERY
NERVOUS,--SHE HAS NOT ELINOR'S CONSTITUTION;--AND ONE MUST
ALLOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING VERY TRYING TO A YOUNG WOMAN
WHO HAS BEEN A BEAUTY IN THE LOSS OF HER PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS.
YOU WOULD NOT THINK IT PERHAPS, BUT MARIANNE WAS REMARKABLY
HANDSOME A FEW MONTHS AGO; QUITE AS HANDSOME AS ELINOR.--
NOW YOU SEE IT IS ALL GONE."



CHAPTER 35


ELINOR'S CURIOSITY TO SEE MRS. FERRARS WAS SATISFIED.--
SHE HAD FOUND IN HER EVERY THING THAT COULD TEND TO MAKE
A FARTHER CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES UNDESIRABLE.--
SHE HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF HER PRIDE, HER MEANNESS, AND HER
DETERMINED PREJUDICE AGAINST HERSELF, TO COMPREHEND ALL
THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST HAVE PERPLEXED THE ENGAGEMENT,
AND RETARDED THE MARRIAGE, OF EDWARD AND HERSELF, HAD HE BEEN
OTHERWISE FREE;--AND SHE HAD SEEN ALMOST ENOUGH TO BE THANKFUL
FOR HER OWN SAKE, THAT ONE GREATER OBSTACLE PRESERVED HER
FROM SUFFERING UNDER ANY OTHER OF MRS. FERRARS'S CREATION,
PRESERVED HER FROM ALL DEPENDENCE UPON HER CAPRICE, OR ANY
SOLICITUDE FOR HER GOOD OPINION.  OR AT LEAST, IF SHE DID NOT
BRING HERSELF QUITE TO REJOICE IN EDWARD'S BEING FETTERED
TO LUCY, SHE DETERMINED, THAT HAD LUCY BEEN MORE AMIABLE,
SHE OUGHT TO HAVE REJOICED.

SHE WONDERED THAT LUCY'S SPIRITS COULD BE SO VERY MUCH
ELEVATED BY THE CIVILITY OF MRS. FERRARS;--THAT HER INTEREST
AND HER VANITY SHOULD SO VERY MUCH BLIND HER AS TO MAKE
THE ATTENTION WHICH SEEMED ONLY PAID HER BECAUSE SHE WAS
NOT ELINOR, APPEAR A COMPLIMENT TO HERSELF--OR TO ALLOW
HER TO DERIVE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM A PREFERENCE ONLY GIVEN HER,
BECAUSE HER REAL SITUATION WAS UNKNOWN.  BUT THAT IT WAS SO,
HAD NOT ONLY BEEN DECLARED BY LUCY'S EYES AT THE TIME,
BUT WAS DECLARED OVER AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING MORE OPENLY,
FOR AT HER PARTICULAR DESIRE, LADY MIDDLETON SET HER DOWN
IN BERKELEY STREET ON THE CHANCE OF SEEING ELINOR ALONE,
TO TELL HER HOW HAPPY SHE WAS.

THE CHANCE PROVED A LUCKY ONE, FOR A MESSAGE FROM
MRS. PALMER SOON AFTER SHE ARRIVED, CARRIED MRS. JENNINGS AWAY.

"MY DEAR FRIEND," CRIED LUCY, AS SOON AS THEY WERE
BY THEMSELVES, "I COME TO TALK TO YOU OF MY HAPPINESS.
COULD ANYTHING BE SO FLATTERING AS MRS. FERRARS'S WAY
OF TREATING ME YESTERDAY?  SO EXCEEDING AFFABLE AS SHE
WAS!--YOU KNOW HOW I DREADED THE THOUGHTS OF SEEING HER;--
BUT THE VERY MOMENT I WAS INTRODUCED, THERE WAS SUCH AN
AFFABILITY IN HER BEHAVIOUR AS REALLY SHOULD SEEM TO SAY,
SHE HAD QUITE TOOK A FANCY TO ME.  NOW WAS NOT IT SO?--
YOU SAW IT ALL; AND WAS NOT YOU QUITE STRUCK WITH IT?"

"SHE WAS CERTAINLY VERY CIVIL TO YOU."

"CIVIL!--DID YOU SEE NOTHING BUT ONLY CIVILITY?--
I SAW A VAST DEAL MORE.  SUCH KINDNESS AS FELL TO THE SHARE
OF NOBODY BUT ME!--NO PRIDE, NO HAUTEUR, AND YOUR SISTER
JUST THE SAME--ALL SWEETNESS AND AFFABILITY!"

ELINOR WISHED TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE, BUT LUCY STILL
PRESSED HER TO OWN THAT SHE HAD REASON FOR HER HAPPINESS;
AND ELINOR WAS OBLIGED TO GO ON.--

"UNDOUBTEDLY, IF THEY HAD KNOWN YOUR ENGAGEMENT,"
SAID SHE, "NOTHING COULD BE MORE FLATTERING THAN THEIR
TREATMENT OF YOU;--BUT AS THAT WAS NOT THE CASE"--

"I GUESSED YOU WOULD SAY SO"--REPLIED LUCY
QUICKLY--"BUT THERE WAS NO REASON IN THE WORLD WHY
MRS. FERRARS SHOULD SEEM TO LIKE ME, IF SHE DID NOT,
AND HER LIKING ME IS EVERY THING.  YOU SHAN'T TALK ME
OUT OF MY SATISFACTION.  I AM SURE IT WILL ALL END WELL,
AND THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTIES AT ALL, TO WHAT I
USED TO THINK.  MRS. FERRARS IS A CHARMING WOMAN,
AND SO IS YOUR SISTER.  THEY ARE BOTH DELIGHTFUL WOMEN,
INDEED!--I WONDER I SHOULD NEVER HEAR YOU SAY HOW AGREEABLE
MRS. DASHWOOD WAS!"

TO THIS ELINOR HAD NO ANSWER TO MAKE, AND DID NOT
ATTEMPT ANY.

"ARE YOU ILL, MISS DASHWOOD?--YOU SEEM LOW--YOU
DON'T SPEAK;--SURE YOU AN'T WELL."

"I NEVER WAS IN BETTER HEALTH."

"I AM GLAD OF IT WITH ALL MY HEART; BUT REALLY YOU DID
NOT LOOK IT.  I SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE YOU ILL; YOU, THAT HAVE
BEEN THE GREATEST COMFORT TO ME IN THE WORLD!--HEAVEN
KNOWS WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDSHIP."--

ELINOR TRIED TO MAKE A CIVIL ANSWER, THOUGH DOUBTING
HER OWN SUCCESS.  BUT IT SEEMED TO SATISFY LUCY, FOR SHE
DIRECTLY REPLIED,

"INDEED I AM PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF YOUR REGARD
FOR ME, AND NEXT TO EDWARD'S LOVE, IT IS THE GREATEST
COMFORT I HAVE.--POOR EDWARD!--BUT NOW THERE IS ONE
GOOD THING, WE SHALL BE ABLE TO MEET, AND MEET PRETTY OFTEN,
FOR LADY MIDDLETON'S DELIGHTED WITH MRS. DASHWOOD,
SO WE SHALL BE A GOOD DEAL IN HARLEY STREET, I DARE SAY,
AND EDWARD SPENDS HALF HIS TIME WITH HIS SISTER--BESIDES,
LADY MIDDLETON AND MRS. FERRARS WILL VISIT NOW;--
AND MRS. FERRARS AND YOUR SISTER WERE BOTH SO GOOD TO SAY
MORE THAN ONCE, THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE GLAD TO SEE ME.--
THEY ARE SUCH CHARMING WOMEN!--I AM SURE IF EVER YOU
TELL YOUR SISTER WHAT I THINK OF HER, YOU CANNOT SPEAK
TOO HIGH."

BUT ELINOR WOULD NOT GIVE HER ANY ENCOURAGEMENT
TO HOPE THAT SHE SHOULD TELL HER SISTER.  LUCY CONTINUED.

"I AM SURE I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT IN A MOMENT,
IF MRS. FERRARS HAD TOOK A DISLIKE TO ME.  IF SHE HAD ONLY
MADE ME A FORMAL COURTESY, FOR INSTANCE, WITHOUT SAYING
A WORD, AND NEVER AFTER HAD TOOK ANY NOTICE OF ME,
AND NEVER LOOKED AT ME IN A PLEASANT WAY--YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN--IF I HAD BEEN TREATED IN THAT FORBIDDING
SORT OF WAY, I SHOULD HAVE GAVE IT ALL UP IN DESPAIR.
I COULD NOT HAVE STOOD IT.  FOR WHERE SHE DOES DISLIKE,
I KNOW IT IS MOST VIOLENT."

ELINOR WAS PREVENTED FROM MAKING ANY REPLY TO THIS
CIVIL TRIUMPH, BY THE DOOR'S BEING THROWN OPEN, THE SERVANT'S
ANNOUNCING MR. FERRARS, AND EDWARD'S IMMEDIATELY WALKING IN.

IT WAS A VERY AWKWARD MOMENT; AND THE COUNTENANCE OF EACH
SHEWED THAT IT WAS SO.  THEY ALL LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY FOOLISH;
AND EDWARD SEEMED TO HAVE AS GREAT AN INCLINATION TO WALK
OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN, AS TO ADVANCE FARTHER INTO IT.
THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE, IN ITS UNPLEASANTEST FORM,
WHICH THEY WOULD EACH HAVE BEEN MOST ANXIOUS TO AVOID,
HAD FALLEN ON THEM.--THEY WERE NOT ONLY ALL THREE TOGETHER,
BUT WERE TOGETHER WITHOUT THE RELIEF OF ANY OTHER PERSON.
THE LADIES RECOVERED THEMSELVES FIRST.  IT WAS NOT LUCY'S
BUSINESS TO PUT HERSELF FORWARD, AND THE APPEARANCE OF
SECRECY MUST STILL BE KEPT UP.  SHE COULD THEREFORE ONLY
LOOK HER TENDERNESS, AND AFTER SLIGHTLY ADDRESSING HIM,
SAID NO MORE.

BUT ELINOR HAD MORE TO DO; AND SO ANXIOUS WAS SHE,
FOR HIS SAKE AND HER OWN, TO DO IT WELL, THAT SHE
FORCED HERSELF, AFTER A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION,
TO WELCOME HIM, WITH A LOOK AND MANNER THAT WERE ALMOST EASY,
AND ALMOST OPEN; AND ANOTHER STRUGGLE, ANOTHER EFFORT STILL
IMPROVED THEM.  SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PRESENCE OF LUCY,
NOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME INJUSTICE TOWARDS HERSELF,
TO DETER HER FROM SAYING THAT SHE WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIM,
AND THAT SHE HAD VERY MUCH REGRETTED BEING FROM HOME,
WHEN HE CALLED BEFORE IN BERKELEY STREET.  SHE WOULD
NOT BE FRIGHTENED FROM PAYING HIM THOSE ATTENTIONS WHICH,
AS A FRIEND AND ALMOST A RELATION, WERE HIS DUE, BY THE
OBSERVANT EYES OF LUCY, THOUGH SHE SOON PERCEIVED THEM
TO BE NARROWLY WATCHING HER.

HER MANNERS GAVE SOME RE-ASSURANCE TO EDWARD, AND HE
HAD COURAGE ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN; BUT HIS EMBARRASSMENT STILL
EXCEEDED THAT OF THE LADIES IN A PROPORTION, WHICH THE CASE
RENDERED REASONABLE, THOUGH HIS SEX MIGHT MAKE IT RARE;
FOR HIS HEART HAD NOT THE INDIFFERENCE OF LUCY'S, NOR
COULD HIS CONSCIENCE HAVE QUITE THE EASE OF ELINOR'S.

LUCY, WITH A DEMURE AND SETTLED AIR, SEEMED DETERMINED
TO MAKE NO CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE OTHERS,
AND WOULD NOT SAY A WORD; AND ALMOST EVERY THING THAT WAS
SAID, PROCEEDED FROM ELINOR, WHO WAS OBLIGED TO VOLUNTEER
ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT HER MOTHER'S HEALTH, THEIR COMING
TO TOWN, &C. WHICH EDWARD OUGHT TO HAVE INQUIRED ABOUT,
BUT NEVER DID.

HER EXERTIONS DID NOT STOP HERE; FOR SHE SOON
AFTERWARDS FELT HERSELF SO HEROICALLY DISPOSED AS
TO DETERMINE, UNDER PRETENCE OF FETCHING MARIANNE,
TO LEAVE THE OTHERS BY THEMSELVES; AND SHE REALLY DID IT,
AND THAT IN THE HANDSOMEST MANNER, FOR SHE LOITERED AWAY
SEVERAL MINUTES ON THE LANDING-PLACE, WITH THE MOST
HIGH-MINDED FORTITUDE, BEFORE SHE WENT TO HER SISTER.
WHEN THAT WAS ONCE DONE, HOWEVER, IT WAS TIME FOR THE RAPTURES
OF EDWARD TO CEASE; FOR MARIANNE'S JOY HURRIED HER INTO
THE DRAWING-ROOM IMMEDIATELY.  HER PLEASURE IN SEEING HIM
WAS LIKE EVERY OTHER OF HER FEELINGS, STRONG IN ITSELF,
AND STRONGLY SPOKEN.  SHE MET HIM WITH A HAND THAT WOULD
BE TAKEN, AND A VOICE THAT EXPRESSED THE AFFECTION OF A SISTER.

"DEAR EDWARD!" SHE CRIED, "THIS IS A MOMENT OF GREAT
HAPPINESS!--THIS WOULD ALMOST MAKE AMENDS FOR EVERY THING?"

EDWARD TRIED TO RETURN HER KINDNESS AS IT DESERVED,
BUT BEFORE SUCH WITNESSES HE DARED NOT SAY HALF WHAT HE
REALLY FELT.  AGAIN THEY ALL SAT DOWN, AND FOR A MOMENT
OR TWO ALL WERE SILENT; WHILE MARIANNE WAS LOOKING WITH THE
MOST SPEAKING TENDERNESS, SOMETIMES AT EDWARD AND SOMETIMES
AT ELINOR, REGRETTING ONLY THAT THEIR DELIGHT IN EACH
OTHER SHOULD BE CHECKED BY LUCY'S UNWELCOME PRESENCE.
EDWARD WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK, AND IT WAS TO NOTICE
MARIANNE'S ALTERED LOOKS, AND EXPRESS HIS FEAR OF HER
NOT FINDING LONDON AGREE WITH HER.

"OH, DON'T THINK OF ME!" SHE REPLIED WITH SPIRITED
EARNESTNESS, THOUGH HER EYES WERE FILLED WITH TEARS
AS SHE SPOKE, "DON'T THINK OF MY HEALTH.  ELINOR IS WELL,
YOU SEE.  THAT MUST BE ENOUGH FOR US BOTH."

THIS REMARK WAS NOT CALCULATED TO MAKE EDWARD OR
ELINOR MORE EASY, NOR TO CONCILIATE THE GOOD WILL OF LUCY,
WHO LOOKED UP AT MARIANNE WITH NO VERY BENIGNANT EXPRESSION.

"DO YOU LIKE LONDON?" SAID EDWARD, WILLING TO SAY
ANY THING THAT MIGHT INTRODUCE ANOTHER SUBJECT.

"NOT AT ALL.  I EXPECTED MUCH PLEASURE IN IT,
BUT I HAVE FOUND NONE.  THE SIGHT OF YOU, EDWARD, IS THE
ONLY COMFORT IT HAS AFFORDED; AND THANK HEAVEN! YOU
ARE WHAT YOU ALWAYS WERE!"

SHE PAUSED--NO ONE SPOKE.

"I THINK, ELINOR," SHE PRESENTLY ADDED, "WE MUST
EMPLOY EDWARD TO TAKE CARE OF US IN OUR RETURN TO BARTON.
IN A WEEK OR TWO, I SUPPOSE, WE SHALL BE GOING; AND, I TRUST,
EDWARD WILL NOT BE VERY UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THE CHARGE."

POOR EDWARD MUTTERED SOMETHING, BUT WHAT IT WAS,
NOBODY KNEW, NOT EVEN HIMSELF.  BUT MARIANNE, WHO SAW
HIS AGITATION, AND COULD EASILY TRACE IT TO WHATEVER
CAUSE BEST PLEASED HERSELF, WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED,
AND SOON TALKED OF SOMETHING ELSE.

"WE SPENT SUCH A DAY, EDWARD, IN HARLEY STREET
YESTERDAY!  SO DULL, SO WRETCHEDLY DULL!--BUT I HAVE MUCH
TO SAY TO YOU ON THAT HEAD, WHICH CANNOT BE SAID NOW."

AND WITH THIS ADMIRABLE DISCRETION DID SHE DEFER
THE ASSURANCE OF HER FINDING THEIR MUTUAL RELATIVES MORE
DISAGREEABLE THAN EVER, AND OF HER BEING PARTICULARLY
DISGUSTED WITH HIS MOTHER, TILL THEY WERE MORE IN PRIVATE.

"BUT WHY WERE YOU NOT THERE, EDWARD?--WHY DID YOU
NOT COME?"

"I WAS ENGAGED ELSEWHERE."

"ENGAGED!  BUT WHAT WAS THAT, WHEN SUCH FRIENDS
WERE TO BE MET?"

"PERHAPS, MISS MARIANNE," CRIED LUCY, EAGER TO TAKE
SOME REVENGE ON HER, "YOU THINK YOUNG MEN NEVER STAND
UPON ENGAGEMENTS, IF THEY HAVE NO MIND TO KEEP THEM,
LITTLE AS WELL AS GREAT."

ELINOR WAS VERY ANGRY, BUT MARIANNE SEEMED ENTIRELY
INSENSIBLE OF THE STING; FOR SHE CALMLY REPLIED,

"NOT SO, INDEED; FOR, SERIOUSLY SPEAKING, I AM VERY
SURE THAT CONSCIENCE ONLY KEPT EDWARD FROM HARLEY STREET.
AND I REALLY BELIEVE HE HAS THE MOST DELICATE CONSCIENCE
IN THE WORLD; THE MOST SCRUPULOUS IN PERFORMING
EVERY ENGAGEMENT, HOWEVER MINUTE, AND HOWEVER IT
MAY MAKE AGAINST HIS INTEREST OR PLEASURE.  HE IS THE
MOST FEARFUL OF GIVING PAIN, OF WOUNDING EXPECTATION,
AND THE MOST INCAPABLE OF BEING SELFISH, OF ANY BODY
I EVER SAW.  EDWARD, IT IS SO, AND I WILL SAY IT.
WHAT! ARE YOU NEVER TO HEAR YOURSELF PRAISED!--THEN YOU
MUST BE NO FRIEND OF MINE; FOR THOSE WHO WILL ACCEPT
OF MY LOVE AND ESTEEM, MUST SUBMIT TO MY OPEN COMMENDATION."

THE NATURE OF HER COMMENDATION, IN THE PRESENT CASE,
HOWEVER, HAPPENED TO BE PARTICULARLY ILL-SUITED TO THE
FEELINGS OF TWO THIRDS OF HER AUDITORS, AND WAS SO VERY
UNEXHILARATING TO EDWARD, THAT HE VERY SOON GOT UP TO GO AWAY.

"GOING SO SOON!" SAID MARIANNE; "MY DEAR EDWARD,
THIS MUST NOT BE."

AND DRAWING HIM A LITTLE ASIDE, SHE WHISPERED
HER PERSUASION THAT LUCY COULD NOT STAY MUCH LONGER.
BUT EVEN THIS ENCOURAGEMENT FAILED, FOR HE WOULD GO;
AND LUCY, WHO WOULD HAVE OUTSTAID HIM, HAD HIS VISIT LASTED
TWO HOURS, SOON AFTERWARDS WENT AWAY.

"WHAT CAN BRING HER HERE SO OFTEN?" SAID MARIANNE,
ON HER LEAVING THEM.  "COULD NOT SHE SEE THAT WE WANTED
HER GONE!--HOW TEAZING TO EDWARD!"

"WHY SO?--WE WERE ALL HIS FRIENDS, AND LUCY HAS BEEN
THE LONGEST KNOWN TO HIM OF ANY.  IT IS BUT NATURAL
THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AS WELL AS OURSELVES."

MARIANNE LOOKED AT HER STEADILY, AND SAID, "YOU KNOW,
ELINOR, THAT THIS IS A KIND OF TALKING WHICH I CANNOT BEAR.
IF YOU ONLY HOPE TO HAVE YOUR ASSERTION CONTRADICTED,
AS I MUST SUPPOSE TO BE THE CASE, YOU OUGHT TO RECOLLECT
THAT I AM THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO DO IT.
I CANNOT DESCEND TO BE TRICKED OUT OF ASSURANCES, THAT ARE
NOT REALLY WANTED."

SHE THEN LEFT THE ROOM; AND ELINOR DARED NOT FOLLOW
HER TO SAY MORE, FOR BOUND AS SHE WAS BY HER PROMISE
OF SECRECY TO LUCY, SHE COULD GIVE NO INFORMATION THAT
WOULD CONVINCE MARIANNE; AND PAINFUL AS THE CONSEQUENCES
OF HER STILL CONTINUING IN AN ERROR MIGHT BE, SHE WAS
OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO IT.  ALL THAT SHE COULD HOPE, WAS
THAT EDWARD WOULD NOT OFTEN EXPOSE HER OR HIMSELF TO THE
DISTRESS OF HEARING MARIANNE'S MISTAKEN WARMTH, NOR TO THE
REPETITION OF ANY OTHER PART OF THE PAIN THAT HAD ATTENDED
THEIR RECENT MEETING--AND THIS SHE HAD EVERY REASON TO EXPECT.



CHAPTER 36


WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS MEETING, THE NEWSPAPERS
ANNOUNCED TO THE WORLD, THAT THE LADY OF THOMAS PALMER,
ESQ. WAS SAFELY DELIVERED OF A SON AND HEIR; A VERY
INTERESTING AND SATISFACTORY PARAGRAPH, AT LEAST TO ALL
THOSE INTIMATE CONNECTIONS WHO KNEW IT BEFORE.

THIS EVENT, HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO MRS. JENNINGS'S HAPPINESS,
PRODUCED A TEMPORARY ALTERATION IN THE DISPOSAL OF HER TIME,
AND INFLUENCED, IN A LIKE DEGREE, THE ENGAGEMENTS
OF HER YOUNG FRIENDS; FOR AS SHE WISHED TO BE AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE WITH CHARLOTTE, SHE WENT THITHER EVERY MORNING
AS SOON AS SHE WAS DRESSED, AND DID NOT RETURN TILL LATE
IN THE EVENING; AND THE MISS DASHWOODS, AT THE PARTICULAR
REQUEST OF THE MIDDLETONS, SPENT THE WHOLE OF EVERY DAY,
IN EVERY DAY IN CONDUIT STREET.  FOR THEIR OWN COMFORT
THEY WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE REMAINED, AT LEAST ALL
THE MORNING, IN MRS. JENNINGS'S HOUSE; BUT IT WAS NOT
A THING TO BE URGED AGAINST THE WISHES OF EVERYBODY.
THEIR HOURS WERE THEREFORE MADE OVER TO LADY MIDDLETON
AND THE TWO MISS STEELES, BY WHOM THEIR COMPANY, IN FACT
WAS AS LITTLE VALUED, AS IT WAS PROFESSEDLY SOUGHT.

THEY HAD TOO MUCH SENSE TO BE DESIRABLE COMPANIONS
TO THE FORMER; AND BY THE LATTER THEY WERE CONSIDERED WITH
A JEALOUS EYE, AS INTRUDING ON THEIR GROUND, AND SHARING
THE KINDNESS WHICH THEY WANTED TO MONOPOLIZE.  THOUGH NOTHING
COULD BE MORE POLITE THAN LADY MIDDLETON'S BEHAVIOUR TO
ELINOR AND MARIANNE, SHE DID NOT REALLY LIKE THEM AT ALL.
BECAUSE THEY NEITHER FLATTERED HERSELF NOR HER CHILDREN,
SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM GOOD-NATURED; AND BECAUSE THEY
WERE FOND OF READING, SHE FANCIED THEM SATIRICAL: PERHAPS
WITHOUT EXACTLY KNOWING WHAT IT WAS TO BE SATIRICAL;
BUT THAT DID NOT SIGNIFY.  IT WAS CENSURE IN COMMON USE,
AND EASILY GIVEN.

THEIR PRESENCE WAS A RESTRAINT BOTH ON HER AND ON LUCY.
IT CHECKED THE IDLENESS OF ONE, AND THE BUSINESS OF THE OTHER.
LADY MIDDLETON WAS ASHAMED OF DOING NOTHING BEFORE THEM,
AND THE FLATTERY WHICH LUCY WAS PROUD TO THINK OF
AND ADMINISTER AT OTHER TIMES, SHE FEARED THEY WOULD DESPISE
HER FOR OFFERING.  MISS STEELE WAS THE LEAST DISCOMPOSED
OF THE THREE, BY THEIR PRESENCE; AND IT WAS IN THEIR POWER
TO RECONCILE HER TO IT ENTIRELY.  WOULD EITHER OF THEM
ONLY HAVE GIVEN HER A FULL AND MINUTE ACCOUNT OF THE WHOLE
AFFAIR BETWEEN MARIANNE AND MR. WILLOUGHBY, SHE WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT HERSELF AMPLY REWARDED FOR THE SACRIFICE
OF THE BEST PLACE BY THE FIRE AFTER DINNER, WHICH THEIR
ARRIVAL OCCASIONED.  BUT THIS CONCILIATION WAS NOT GRANTED;
FOR THOUGH SHE OFTEN THREW OUT EXPRESSIONS OF PITY FOR HER
SISTER TO ELINOR, AND MORE THAN ONCE DROPT A REFLECTION
ON THE INCONSTANCY OF BEAUX BEFORE MARIANNE, NO EFFECT
WAS PRODUCED, BUT A LOOK OF INDIFFERENCE FROM THE FORMER,
OR OF DISGUST IN THE LATTER.  AN EFFORT EVEN YET LIGHTER
MIGHT HAVE MADE HER THEIR FRIEND.  WOULD THEY ONLY HAVE
LAUGHED AT HER ABOUT THE DOCTOR!  BUT SO LITTLE WERE THEY,
ANYMORE THAN THE OTHERS, INCLINED TO OBLIGE HER,
THAT IF SIR JOHN DINED FROM HOME, SHE MIGHT SPEND A WHOLE
DAY WITHOUT HEARING ANY OTHER RAILLERY ON THE SUBJECT,
THAN WHAT SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO BESTOW ON HERSELF.

ALL THESE JEALOUSIES AND DISCONTENTS, HOWEVER, WERE SO
TOTALLY UNSUSPECTED BY MRS. JENNINGS, THAT SHE THOUGHT
IT A DELIGHTFUL THING FOR THE GIRLS TO BE TOGETHER;
AND GENERALLY CONGRATULATED HER YOUNG FRIENDS EVERY NIGHT,
ON HAVING ESCAPED THE COMPANY OF A STUPID OLD WOMAN SO LONG.
SHE JOINED THEM SOMETIMES AT SIR JOHN'S, SOMETIMES
AT HER OWN HOUSE; BUT WHEREVER IT WAS, SHE ALWAYS CAME
IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS, FULL OF DELIGHT AND IMPORTANCE,
ATTRIBUTING CHARLOTTE'S WELL DOING TO HER OWN CARE, AND READY
TO GIVE SO EXACT, SO MINUTE A DETAIL OF HER SITUATION,
AS ONLY MISS STEELE HAD CURIOSITY ENOUGH TO DESIRE.
ONE THING DID DISTURB HER; AND OF THAT SHE MADE HER
DAILY COMPLAINT.  MR. PALMER MAINTAINED THE COMMON,
BUT UNFATHERLY OPINION AMONG HIS SEX, OF ALL INFANTS BEING ALIKE;
AND THOUGH SHE COULD PLAINLY PERCEIVE, AT DIFFERENT TIMES,
THE MOST STRIKING RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THIS BABY AND EVERY
ONE OF HIS RELATIONS ON BOTH SIDES, THERE WAS NO CONVINCING
HIS FATHER OF IT; NO PERSUADING HIM TO BELIEVE THAT IT
WAS NOT EXACTLY LIKE EVERY OTHER BABY OF THE SAME AGE;
NOR COULD HE EVEN BE BROUGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SIMPLE
PROPOSITION OF ITS BEING THE FINEST CHILD IN THE WORLD.

I COME NOW TO THE RELATION OF A MISFORTUNE,
WHICH ABOUT THIS TIME BEFELL MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD.
IT SO HAPPENED THAT WHILE HER TWO SISTERS WITH
MRS. JENNINGS WERE FIRST CALLING ON HER IN HARLEY STREET,
ANOTHER OF HER ACQUAINTANCE HAD DROPT IN--A CIRCUMSTANCE
IN ITSELF NOT APPARENTLY LIKELY TO PRODUCE EVIL TO HER.
BUT WHILE THE IMAGINATIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE WILL CARRY
THEM AWAY TO FORM WRONG JUDGMENTS OF OUR CONDUCT,
AND TO DECIDE ON IT BY SLIGHT APPEARANCES, ONE'S HAPPINESS
MUST IN SOME MEASURE BE ALWAYS AT THE MERCY OF CHANCE.
IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE, THIS LAST-ARRIVED LADY ALLOWED
HER FANCY TO SO FAR OUTRUN TRUTH AND PROBABILITY,
THAT ON MERELY HEARING THE NAME OF THE MISS DASHWOODS,
AND UNDERSTANDING THEM TO BE MR. DASHWOOD'S SISTERS,
SHE IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDED THEM TO BE STAYING IN HARLEY STREET;
AND THIS MISCONSTRUCTION PRODUCED WITHIN A DAY
OR TWO AFTERWARDS, CARDS OF INVITATION FOR THEM
AS WELL AS FOR THEIR BROTHER AND SISTER, TO A SMALL
MUSICAL PARTY AT HER HOUSE.  THE CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH WAS,
THAT MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT NOT ONLY
TO THE EXCEEDINGLY GREAT INCONVENIENCE OF SENDING HER
CARRIAGE FOR THE MISS DASHWOODS, BUT, WHAT WAS STILL WORSE,
MUST BE SUBJECT TO ALL THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF APPEARING
TO TREAT THEM WITH ATTENTION: AND WHO COULD TELL THAT THEY
MIGHT NOT EXPECT TO GO OUT WITH HER A SECOND TIME?  THE POWER
OF DISAPPOINTING THEM, IT WAS TRUE, MUST ALWAYS BE HER'S.
BUT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH; FOR WHEN PEOPLE ARE DETERMINED
ON A MODE OF CONDUCT WHICH THEY KNOW TO BE WRONG, THEY FEEL
INJURED BY THE EXPECTATION OF ANY THING BETTER FROM THEM.

MARIANNE HAD NOW BEEN BROUGHT BY DEGREES, SO MUCH
INTO THE HABIT OF GOING OUT EVERY DAY, THAT IT WAS BECOME
A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO HER, WHETHER SHE WENT OR NOT:
AND SHE PREPARED QUIETLY AND MECHANICALLY FOR EVERY
EVENING'S ENGAGEMENT, THOUGH WITHOUT EXPECTING THE SMALLEST
AMUSEMENT FROM ANY, AND VERY OFTEN WITHOUT KNOWING,
TILL THE LAST MOMENT, WHERE IT WAS TO TAKE HER.

TO HER DRESS AND APPEARANCE SHE WAS GROWN SO PERFECTLY
INDIFFERENT, AS NOT TO BESTOW HALF THE CONSIDERATION ON IT,
DURING THE WHOLE OF HER TOILET, WHICH IT RECEIVED FROM
MISS STEELE IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF THEIR BEING
TOGETHER, WHEN IT WAS FINISHED.  NOTHING ESCAPED HER MINUTE
OBSERVATION AND GENERAL CURIOSITY; SHE SAW EVERY THING,
AND ASKED EVERY THING; WAS NEVER EASY TILL SHE KNEW THE PRICE
OF EVERY PART OF MARIANNE'S DRESS; COULD HAVE GUESSED THE
NUMBER OF HER GOWNS ALTOGETHER WITH BETTER JUDGMENT THAN
MARIANNE HERSELF, AND WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPES OF FINDING OUT
BEFORE THEY PARTED, HOW MUCH HER WASHING COST PER WEEK,
AND HOW MUCH SHE HAD EVERY YEAR TO SPEND UPON HERSELF.
THE IMPERTINENCE OF THESE KIND OF SCRUTINIES, MOREOVER,
WAS GENERALLY CONCLUDED WITH A COMPLIMENT, WHICH
THOUGH MEANT AS ITS DOUCEUR, WAS CONSIDERED BY MARIANNE
AS THE GREATEST IMPERTINENCE OF ALL; FOR AFTER UNDERGOING
AN EXAMINATION INTO THE VALUE AND MAKE OF HER GOWN,
THE COLOUR OF HER SHOES, AND THE ARRANGEMENT OF HER HAIR,
SHE WAS ALMOST SURE OF BEING TOLD THAT UPON "HER WORD
SHE LOOKED VASTLY SMART, AND SHE DARED TO SAY SHE WOULD
MAKE A GREAT MANY CONQUESTS."

WITH SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT AS THIS, WAS SHE DISMISSED
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION, TO HER BROTHER'S CARRIAGE;
WHICH THEY WERE READY TO ENTER FIVE MINUTES AFTER IT
STOPPED AT THE DOOR, A PUNCTUALITY NOT VERY AGREEABLE
TO THEIR SISTER-IN-LAW, WHO HAD PRECEDED THEM TO THE HOUSE
OF HER ACQUAINTANCE, AND WAS THERE HOPING FOR SOME DELAY
ON THEIR PART THAT MIGHT INCONVENIENCE EITHER HERSELF
OR HER COACHMAN.

THE EVENTS OF THIS EVENING WERE NOT VERY REMARKABLE.
THE PARTY, LIKE OTHER MUSICAL PARTIES, COMPREHENDED A
GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO HAD REAL TASTE FOR THE PERFORMANCE,
AND A GREAT MANY MORE WHO HAD NONE AT ALL; AND THE PERFORMERS
THEMSELVES WERE, AS USUAL, IN THEIR OWN ESTIMATION,
AND THAT OF THEIR IMMEDIATE FRIENDS, THE FIRST PRIVATE
PERFORMERS IN ENGLAND.

AS ELINOR WAS NEITHER MUSICAL, NOR AFFECTING TO BE SO,
SHE MADE NO SCRUPLE OF TURNING HER EYES FROM THE GRAND
PIANOFORTE, WHENEVER IT SUITED HER, AND UNRESTRAINED EVEN
BY THE PRESENCE OF A HARP, AND VIOLONCELLO, WOULD FIX
THEM AT PLEASURE ON ANY OTHER OBJECT IN THE ROOM.  IN ONE
OF THESE EXCURSIVE GLANCES SHE PERCEIVED AMONG A GROUP
OF YOUNG MEN, THE VERY HE, WHO HAD GIVEN THEM A LECTURE
ON TOOTHPICK-CASES AT GRAY'S.  SHE PERCEIVED HIM SOON
AFTERWARDS LOOKING AT HERSELF, AND SPEAKING FAMILIARLY
TO HER BROTHER; AND HAD JUST DETERMINED TO FIND OUT HIS
NAME FROM THE LATTER, WHEN THEY BOTH CAME TOWARDS HER,
AND MR. DASHWOOD INTRODUCED HIM TO HER AS MR. ROBERT FERRARS.

HE ADDRESSED HER WITH EASY CIVILITY, AND TWISTED
HIS HEAD INTO A BOW WHICH ASSURED HER AS PLAINLY AS
WORDS COULD HAVE DONE, THAT HE WAS EXACTLY THE COXCOMB
SHE HAD HEARD HIM DESCRIBED TO BE BY LUCY.  HAPPY HAD
IT BEEN FOR HER, IF HER REGARD FOR EDWARD HAD DEPENDED
LESS ON HIS OWN MERIT, THAN ON THE MERIT OF HIS NEAREST
RELATIONS!  FOR THEN HIS BROTHER'S BOW MUST HAVE GIVEN
THE FINISHING STROKE TO WHAT THE ILL-HUMOUR OF HIS MOTHER
AND SISTER WOULD HAVE BEGUN.  BUT WHILE SHE WONDERED
AT THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TWO YOUNG MEN, SHE DID NOT FIND
THAT THE EMPTINESS OF CONCEIT OF THE ONE, PUT HER OUT
OF ALL CHARITY WITH THE MODESTY AND WORTH OF THE OTHER.
WHY THEY WERE DIFFERENT, ROBERT EXCLAIMED TO HER HIMSELF
IN THE COURSE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S CONVERSATION;
FOR, TALKING OF HIS BROTHER, AND LAMENTING THE EXTREME
GAUCHERIE WHICH HE REALLY BELIEVED KEPT HIM FROM MIXING
IN PROPER SOCIETY, HE CANDIDLY AND GENEROUSLY ATTRIBUTED IT
MUCH LESS TO ANY NATURAL DEFICIENCY, THAN TO THE MISFORTUNE
OF A PRIVATE EDUCATION; WHILE HE HIMSELF, THOUGH PROBABLY
WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR, ANY MATERIAL SUPERIORITY
BY NATURE, MERELY FROM THE ADVANTAGE OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL,
WAS AS WELL FITTED TO MIX IN THE WORLD AS ANY OTHER MAN.

"UPON MY SOUL," HE ADDED, "I BELIEVE IT IS NOTHING MORE;
AND SO I OFTEN TELL MY MOTHER, WHEN SHE IS GRIEVING
ABOUT IT.  'MY DEAR MADAM,' I ALWAYS SAY TO HER, 'YOU MUST
MAKE YOURSELF EASY.  THE EVIL IS NOW IRREMEDIABLE,
AND IT HAS BEEN ENTIRELY YOUR OWN DOING.  WHY WOULD
YOU BE PERSUADED BY MY UNCLE, SIR ROBERT, AGAINST YOUR
OWN JUDGMENT, TO PLACE EDWARD UNDER PRIVATE TUITION,
AT THE MOST CRITICAL TIME OF HIS LIFE?  IF YOU HAD ONLY SENT
HIM TO WESTMINSTER AS WELL AS MYSELF, INSTEAD OF SENDING
HIM TO MR. PRATT'S, ALL THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.'
THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH I ALWAYS CONSIDER THE MATTER,
AND MY MOTHER IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER ERROR."

ELINOR WOULD NOT OPPOSE HIS OPINION, BECAUSE,
WHATEVER MIGHT BE HER GENERAL ESTIMATION OF THE ADVANTAGE
OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL, SHE COULD NOT THINK OF EDWARD'S
ABODE IN MR. PRATT'S FAMILY, WITH ANY SATISFACTION.

"YOU RESIDE IN DEVONSHIRE, I THINK,"--WAS HIS
NEXT OBSERVATION, "IN A COTTAGE NEAR DAWLISH."

ELINOR SET HIM RIGHT AS TO ITS SITUATION;
AND IT SEEMED RATHER SURPRISING TO HIM THAT ANYBODY
COULD LIVE IN DEVONSHIRE, WITHOUT LIVING NEAR DAWLISH.
HE BESTOWED HIS HEARTY APPROBATION HOWEVER ON THEIR
SPECIES OF HOUSE.

"FOR MY OWN PART," SAID HE, "I AM EXCESSIVELY FOND
OF A COTTAGE; THERE IS ALWAYS SO MUCH COMFORT, SO MUCH
ELEGANCE ABOUT THEM.  AND I PROTEST, IF I HAD ANY MONEY
TO SPARE, I SHOULD BUY A LITTLE LAND AND BUILD ONE MYSELF,
WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF LONDON, WHERE I MIGHT DRIVE
MYSELF DOWN AT ANY TIME, AND COLLECT A FEW FRIENDS
ABOUT ME, AND BE HAPPY.  I ADVISE EVERY BODY WHO IS GOING
TO BUILD, TO BUILD A COTTAGE.  MY FRIEND LORD COURTLAND
CAME TO ME THE OTHER DAY ON PURPOSE TO ASK MY ADVICE,
AND LAID BEFORE ME THREE DIFFERENT PLANS OF BONOMI'S.
I WAS TO DECIDE ON THE BEST OF THEM.  'MY DEAR COURTLAND,'
SAID I, IMMEDIATELY THROWING THEM ALL INTO THE FIRE, 'DO NOT
ADOPT EITHER OF THEM, BUT BY ALL MEANS BUILD A COTTAGE.'
AND THAT I FANCY, WILL BE THE END OF IT.

"SOME PEOPLE IMAGINE THAT THERE CAN BE NO ACCOMMODATIONS,
NO SPACE IN A COTTAGE; BUT THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE.
I WAS LAST MONTH AT MY FRIEND ELLIOTT'S, NEAR DARTFORD.
LADY ELLIOTT WISHED TO GIVE A DANCE.  'BUT HOW CAN IT
BE DONE?' SAID SHE; 'MY DEAR FERRARS, DO TELL ME HOW IT
IS TO BE MANAGED.  THERE IS NOT A ROOM IN THIS COTTAGE
THAT WILL HOLD TEN COUPLE, AND WHERE CAN THE SUPPER BE?'
I IMMEDIATELY SAW THAT THERE COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN IT,
SO I SAID, 'MY DEAR LADY ELLIOTT, DO NOT BE UNEASY.
THE DINING PARLOUR WILL ADMIT EIGHTEEN COUPLE WITH EASE;
CARD-TABLES MAY BE PLACED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM; THE LIBRARY
MAY BE OPEN FOR TEA AND OTHER REFRESHMENTS; AND LET THE
SUPPER BE SET OUT IN THE SALOON.'  LADY ELLIOTT WAS DELIGHTED
WITH THE THOUGHT.  WE MEASURED THE DINING-ROOM, AND FOUND
IT WOULD HOLD EXACTLY EIGHTEEN COUPLE, AND THE AFFAIR
WAS ARRANGED PRECISELY AFTER MY PLAN.  SO THAT, IN FACT,
YOU SEE, IF PEOPLE DO BUT KNOW HOW TO SET ABOUT IT,
EVERY COMFORT MAY BE AS WELL ENJOYED IN A COTTAGE
AS IN THE MOST SPACIOUS DWELLING."

ELINOR AGREED TO IT ALL, FOR SHE DID NOT THINK
HE DESERVED THE COMPLIMENT OF RATIONAL OPPOSITION.

AS JOHN DASHWOOD HAD NO MORE PLEASURE IN MUSIC THAN HIS
ELDEST SISTER, HIS MIND WAS EQUALLY AT LIBERTY TO FIX ON
ANY THING ELSE; AND A THOUGHT STRUCK HIM DURING THE EVENING,
WHICH HE COMMUNICATED TO HIS WIFE, FOR HER APPROBATION,
WHEN THEY GOT HOME.  THE CONSIDERATION OF MRS. DENNISON'S
MISTAKE,
IN SUPPOSING HIS SISTERS THEIR GUESTS, HAD SUGGESTED THE
PROPRIETY OF THEIR BEING REALLY INVITED TO BECOME SUCH,
WHILE MRS. JENNING'S ENGAGEMENTS KEPT HER FROM HOME.
THE EXPENSE WOULD BE NOTHING, THE INCONVENIENCE NOT MORE;
AND IT WAS ALTOGETHER AN ATTENTION WHICH THE DELICACY
OF HIS CONSCIENCE POINTED OUT TO BE REQUISITE TO ITS
COMPLETE ENFRANCHISEMENT FROM HIS PROMISE TO HIS FATHER.
FANNY WAS STARTLED AT THE PROPOSAL.

"I DO NOT SEE HOW IT CAN BE DONE," SAID SHE,
"WITHOUT AFFRONTING LADY MIDDLETON, FOR THEY SPEND EVERY DAY
WITH HER; OTHERWISE I SHOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY GLAD TO DO IT.
YOU KNOW I AM ALWAYS READY TO PAY THEM ANY ATTENTION
IN MY POWER, AS MY TAKING THEM OUT THIS EVENING SHEWS.
BUT THEY ARE LADY MIDDLETON'S VISITORS.  HOW CAN I ASK THEM
AWAY FROM HER?"

HER HUSBAND, BUT WITH GREAT HUMILITY, DID NOT SEE
THE FORCE OF HER OBJECTION.  "THEY HAD ALREADY SPENT A WEEK
IN THIS MANNER IN CONDUIT STREET, AND LADY MIDDLETON
COULD NOT BE DISPLEASED AT THEIR GIVING THE SAME NUMBER
OF DAYS TO SUCH NEAR RELATIONS."

FANNY PAUSED A MOMENT, AND THEN, WITH FRESH VIGOR, SAID,

"MY LOVE I WOULD ASK THEM WITH ALL MY HEART, IF IT
WAS IN MY POWER.  BUT I HAD JUST SETTLED WITHIN MYSELF
TO ASK THE MISS STEELES TO SPEND A FEW DAYS WITH US.
THEY ARE VERY WELL BEHAVED, GOOD KIND OF GIRLS; AND I THINK
THE ATTENTION IS DUE TO THEM, AS THEIR UNCLE DID SO VERY
WELL BY EDWARD.  WE CAN ASK YOUR SISTERS SOME OTHER YEAR,
YOU KNOW; BUT THE MISS STEELES MAY NOT BE IN TOWN ANY MORE.
I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE THEM; INDEED, YOU DO LIKE THEM,
YOU KNOW, VERY MUCH ALREADY, AND SO DOES MY MOTHER; AND THEY
ARE SUCH FAVOURITES WITH HARRY!"

MR. DASHWOOD WAS CONVINCED.  HE SAW THE NECESSITY
OF INVITING THE MISS STEELES IMMEDIATELY, AND HIS CONSCIENCE
WAS PACIFIED BY THE RESOLUTION OF INVITING HIS SISTERS
ANOTHER YEAR; AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, SLYLY SUSPECTING
THAT ANOTHER YEAR WOULD MAKE THE INVITATION NEEDLESS,
BY BRINGING ELINOR TO TOWN AS COLONEL BRANDON'S WIFE,
AND MARIANNE AS THEIR VISITOR.

FANNY, REJOICING IN HER ESCAPE, AND PROUD OF THE READY
WIT THAT HAD PROCURED IT, WROTE THE NEXT MORNING TO LUCY,
TO REQUEST HER COMPANY AND HER SISTER'S, FOR SOME DAYS,
IN HARLEY STREET, AS SOON AS LADY MIDDLETON COULD SPARE THEM.
THIS WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE LUCY REALLY AND REASONABLY HAPPY.
MRS. DASHWOOD SEEMED ACTUALLY WORKING FOR HER, HERSELF;
CHERISHING ALL HER HOPES, AND PROMOTING ALL HER VIEWS!
SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING WITH EDWARD AND HIS FAMILY WAS,
ABOVE ALL THINGS, THE MOST MATERIAL TO HER INTEREST,
AND SUCH AN INVITATION THE MOST GRATIFYING TO HER
FEELINGS!  IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE THAT COULD NOT BE TOO
GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED, NOR TOO SPEEDILY MADE USE OF;
AND THE VISIT TO LADY MIDDLETON, WHICH HAD NOT BEFORE HAD
ANY PRECISE LIMITS, WAS INSTANTLY DISCOVERED TO HAVE BEEN
ALWAYS MEANT TO END IN TWO DAYS' TIME.

WHEN THE NOTE WAS SHOWN TO ELINOR, AS IT WAS WITHIN TEN
MINUTES AFTER ITS ARRIVAL, IT GAVE HER, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
SOME SHARE IN THE EXPECTATIONS OF LUCY; FOR SUCH A MARK
OF UNCOMMON KINDNESS, VOUCHSAFED ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE,
SEEMED TO DECLARE THAT THE GOOD-WILL TOWARDS HER AROSE
FROM SOMETHING MORE THAN MERELY MALICE AGAINST HERSELF;
AND MIGHT BE BROUGHT, BY TIME AND ADDRESS, TO DO
EVERY THING THAT LUCY WISHED.  HER FLATTERY HAD ALREADY
SUBDUED THE PRIDE OF LADY MIDDLETON, AND MADE AN ENTRY
INTO THE CLOSE HEART OF MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD; AND THESE
WERE EFFECTS THAT LAID OPEN THE PROBABILITY OF GREATER.

THE MISS STEELES REMOVED TO HARLEY STREET, AND ALL
THAT REACHED ELINOR OF THEIR INFLUENCE THERE, STRENGTHENED
HER EXPECTATION OF THE EVENT.  SIR JOHN, WHO CALLED ON
THEM MORE THAN ONCE, BROUGHT HOME SUCH ACCOUNTS OF THE
FAVOUR THEY WERE IN, AS MUST BE UNIVERSALLY STRIKING.
MRS. DASHWOOD HAD NEVER BEEN SO MUCH PLEASED WITH ANY
YOUNG WOMEN IN HER LIFE, AS SHE WAS WITH THEM; HAD GIVEN
EACH OF THEM A NEEDLE BOOK MADE BY SOME EMIGRANT;
CALLED LUCY BY HER CHRISTIAN NAME; AND DID NOT KNOW
WHETHER SHE SHOULD EVER BE ABLE TO PART WITH THEM.





[AT THIS POINT IN THE FIRST AND SECOND EDTIONS, VOLUME II ENDED.]




CHAPTER 37


MRS. PALMER WAS SO WELL AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT,
THAT HER MOTHER FELT IT NO LONGER NECESSARY TO GIVE UP
THE WHOLE OF HER TIME TO HER; AND, CONTENTING HERSELF WITH
VISITING HER ONCE OR TWICE A DAY, RETURNED FROM THAT PERIOD
TO HER OWN HOME, AND HER OWN HABITS, IN WHICH SHE FOUND
THE MISS DASHWOODS VERY READY TO RESUME THEIR FORMER SHARE.

ABOUT THE THIRD OR FOURTH MORNING AFTER THEIR
BEING THUS RESETTLED IN BERKELEY STREET, MRS. JENNINGS,
ON RETURNING FROM HER ORDINARY VISIT TO MRS. PALMER,
ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM, WHERE ELINOR WAS SITTING
BY HERSELF, WITH AN AIR OF SUCH HURRYING IMPORTANCE
AS PREPARED HER TO HEAR SOMETHING WONDERFUL; AND GIVING HER
TIME ONLY TO FORM THAT IDEA, BEGAN DIRECTLY TO JUSTIFY IT,
BY SAYING,

"LORD! MY DEAR MISS DASHWOOD! HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS?"

"NO, MA'AM.  WHAT IS IT?"

"SOMETHING SO STRANGE!  BUT YOU SHALL HEAR IT ALL.--
WHEN I GOT TO MR. PALMER'S, I FOUND CHARLOTTE QUITE
IN A FUSS ABOUT THE CHILD.  SHE WAS SURE IT WAS VERY
ILL--IT CRIED, AND FRETTED, AND WAS ALL OVER PIMPLES.
SO I LOOKED AT IT DIRECTLY, AND, 'LORD! MY DEAR,'
SAYS I, 'IT IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD, BUT THE RED GUM--'
AND NURSE SAID JUST THE SAME.  BUT CHARLOTTE, SHE WOULD
NOT BE SATISFIED, SO MR. DONAVAN WAS SENT FOR; AND LUCKILY
HE HAPPENED TO JUST COME IN FROM HARLEY STREET, SO HE
STEPPED OVER DIRECTLY, AND AS SOON AS EVER HE SAW THE CHILD,
BE SAID JUST AS WE DID, THAT IT WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD
BUT THE RED GUM, AND THEN CHARLOTTE WAS EASY.  AND SO,
JUST AS HE WAS GOING AWAY AGAIN, IT CAME INTO MY HEAD,
I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW HOW I HAPPENED TO THINK OF IT,
BUT IT CAME INTO MY HEAD TO ASK HIM IF THERE WAS ANY NEWS.
SO UPON THAT, HE SMIRKED, AND SIMPERED, AND LOOKED GRAVE,
AND SEEMED TO KNOW SOMETHING OR OTHER, AND AT LAST HE
SAID IN A WHISPER, 'FOR FEAR ANY UNPLEASANT REPORT
SHOULD REACH THE YOUNG LADIES UNDER YOUR CARE AS TO THEIR
SISTER'S INDISPOSITION, I THINK IT ADVISABLE TO SAY,
THAT I BELIEVE THERE IS NO GREAT REASON FOR ALARM; I HOPE
MRS. DASHWOOD WILL DO VERY WELL.'"

"WHAT! IS FANNY ILL?"

"THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAID, MY DEAR.  'LORD!' SAYS I,
'IS MRS. DASHWOOD ILL?' SO THEN IT ALL CAME OUT; AND THE
LONG AND THE SHORT OF THE MATTER, BY ALL I CAN LEARN,
SEEMS TO BE THIS.  MR. EDWARD FERRARS, THE VERY YOUNG
MAN I USED TO JOKE WITH YOU ABOUT (BUT HOWEVER, AS IT
TURNS OUT, I AM MONSTROUS GLAD THERE WAS NEVER ANY THING
IN IT), MR. EDWARD FERRARS, IT SEEMS, HAS BEEN ENGAGED
ABOVE THIS TWELVEMONTH TO MY COUSIN LUCY!--THERE'S FOR YOU,
MY DEAR!--AND NOT A CREATURE KNOWING A SYLLABLE OF THE MATTER,
EXCEPT NANCY!--COULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED SUCH A THING POSSIBLE?--
THERE IS NO GREAT WONDER IN THEIR LIKING ONE ANOTHER;
BUT THAT MATTERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT SO FORWARD BETWEEN THEM,
AND NOBODY SUSPECT IT!--THAT IS STRANGE!--I NEVER HAPPENED
TO SEE THEM TOGETHER, OR I AM SURE I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT
OUT DIRECTLY.  WELL, AND SO THIS WAS KEPT A GREAT SECRET,
FOR FEAR OF MRS. FERRARS, AND NEITHER SHE NOR YOUR
BROTHER OR SISTER SUSPECTED A WORD OF THE MATTER;--
TILL THIS VERY MORNING, POOR NANCY, WHO, YOU KNOW, IS A
WELL-MEANING CREATURE, BUT NO CONJURER, POPT IT ALL OUT.
'LORD!' THINKS SHE TO HERSELF, 'THEY ARE ALL SO FOND
OF LUCY, TO BE SURE THEY WILL MAKE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT;'
AND SO, AWAY SHE WENT TO YOUR SISTER, WHO WAS SITTING ALL
ALONE AT HER CARPET-WORK, LITTLE SUSPECTING WHAT WAS TO
COME--FOR SHE HAD JUST BEEN SAYING TO YOUR BROTHER, ONLY FIVE
MINUTES BEFORE, THAT SHE THOUGHT TO MAKE A MATCH BETWEEN
EDWARD AND SOME LORD'S DAUGHTER OR OTHER, I FORGET WHO.
SO YOU MAY THINK WHAT A BLOW IT WAS TO ALL HER VANITY
AND PRIDE.  SHE FELL INTO VIOLENT HYSTERICS IMMEDIATELY,
WITH SUCH SCREAMS AS REACHED YOUR BROTHER'S EARS,
AS HE WAS SITTING IN HIS OWN DRESSING-ROOM DOWN STAIRS,
THINKING ABOUT WRITING A LETTER TO HIS STEWARD IN THE COUNTRY.
SO UP HE FLEW DIRECTLY, AND A TERRIBLE SCENE TOOK PLACE,
FOR LUCY WAS COME TO THEM BY THAT TIME, LITTLE DREAMING
WHAT WAS GOING ON.  POOR SOUL!  I PITY HER.  AND I MUST SAY,
I THINK SHE WAS USED VERY HARDLY; FOR YOUR SISTER SCOLDED
LIKE ANY FURY, AND SOON DROVE HER INTO A FAINTING FIT.
NANCY, SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES, AND CRIED BITTERLY;
AND YOUR BROTHER, HE WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM, AND SAID
HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO.  MRS. DASHWOOD DECLARED
THEY SHOULD NOT STAY A MINUTE LONGER IN THE HOUSE,
AND YOUR BROTHER WAS FORCED TO GO DOWN UPON HIS KNEES TOO,
TO PERSUADE HER TO LET THEM STAY TILL THEY HAD PACKED
UP THEIR CLOTHES.  THEN SHE FELL INTO HYSTERICS AGAIN,
AND HE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE WOULD SEND FOR MR. DONAVAN,
AND MR. DONAVAN FOUND THE HOUSE IN ALL THIS UPROAR.
THE CARRIAGE WAS AT THE DOOR READY TO TAKE MY POOR
COUSINS AWAY, AND THEY WERE JUST STEPPING IN AS HE
CAME OFF; POOR LUCY IN SUCH A CONDITION, HE SAYS,
SHE COULD HARDLY WALK; AND NANCY, SHE WAS ALMOST AS BAD.
I DECLARE, I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH YOUR SISTER; AND I HOPE,
WITH ALL MY HEART, IT WILL BE A MATCH IN SPITE OF HER.
LORD! WHAT A TAKING POOR MR. EDWARD WILL BE IN WHEN HE
HEARS OF IT!  TO HAVE HIS LOVE USED SO SCORNFULLY! FOR
THEY SAY HE IS MONSTROUS FOND OF HER, AS WELL HE MAY.
I SHOULD NOT WONDER, IF HE WAS TO BE IN THE GREATEST
PASSION!--AND MR. DONAVAN THINKS JUST THE SAME.  HE AND I
HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TALK ABOUT IT; AND THE BEST OF ALL IS,
THAT HE IS GONE BACK AGAIN TO HARLEY STREET, THAT HE MAY
BE WITHIN CALL WHEN MRS. FERRARS IS TOLD OF IT, FOR SHE
WAS SENT FOR AS SOON AS EVER MY COUSINS LEFT THE HOUSE,
FOR YOUR SISTER WAS SURE SHE WOULD BE IN HYSTERICS TOO;
AND SO SHE MAY, FOR WHAT I CARE.  I HAVE NO PITY FOR
EITHER OF THEM.  I HAVE NO NOTION OF PEOPLE'S MAKING
SUCH A TO-DO ABOUT MONEY AND GREATNESS.  THERE IS NO
REASON ON EARTH WHY MR. EDWARD AND LUCY SHOULD NOT MARRY;
FOR I AM SURE MRS. FERRARS MAY AFFORD TO DO VERY WELL
BY HER SON, AND THOUGH LUCY HAS NEXT TO NOTHING HERSELF,
SHE KNOWS BETTER THAN ANY BODY HOW TO MAKE THE MOST
OF EVERY THING; I DARE SAY, IF MRS. FERRARS WOULD ONLY
ALLOW HIM FIVE HUNDRED A-YEAR, SHE WOULD MAKE AS GOOD
AN APPEARANCE WITH IT AS ANY BODY ELSE WOULD WITH EIGHT.
LORD! HOW SNUG THEY MIGHT LIVE IN SUCH ANOTHER COTTAGE
AS YOURS--OR A LITTLE BIGGER--WITH TWO MAIDS, AND TWO MEN;
AND I BELIEVE I COULD HELP THEM TO A HOUSEMAID, FOR MY
BETTY HAS A SISTER OUT OF PLACE, THAT WOULD FIT THEM
EXACTLY."

HERE MRS. JENNINGS CEASED, AND AS ELINOR HAD HAD
TIME ENOUGH TO COLLECT HER THOUGHTS, SHE WAS ABLE
TO GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER, AND MAKE SUCH OBSERVATIONS,
AS THE SUBJECT MIGHT NATURALLY BE SUPPOSED TO PRODUCE.
HAPPY TO FIND THAT SHE WAS NOT SUSPECTED OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY
INTEREST IN IT; THAT MRS. JENNINGS (AS SHE HAD OF LATE
OFTEN HOPED MIGHT BE THE CASE) HAD CEASED TO IMAGINE HER
AT ALL ATTACHED TO EDWARD; AND HAPPY ABOVE ALL THE REST,
IN THE ABSENCE OF MARIANNE, SHE FELT VERY WELL ABLE
TO SPEAK OF THE AFFAIR WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT, AND TO
GIVE HER JUDGMENT, AS SHE BELIEVED, WITH IMPARTIALITY
ON THE CONDUCT OF EVERY ONE CONCERNED IN IT.

SHE COULD HARDLY DETERMINE WHAT HER OWN EXPECTATION
OF ITS EVENT REALLY WAS; THOUGH SHE EARNESTLY TRIED
TO DRIVE AWAY THE NOTION OF ITS BEING POSSIBLE TO END
OTHERWISE AT LAST, THAN IN THE MARRIAGE OF EDWARD AND LUCY.
WHAT MRS. FERRARS WOULD SAY AND DO, THOUGH THERE COULD
NOT BE A DOUBT OF ITS NATURE, SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO HEAR;
AND STILL MORE ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW EDWARD WOULD
CONDUCT HIMSELF.  FOR HIM SHE FELT MUCH COMPASSION;--
FOR LUCY VERY LITTLE--AND IT COST HER SOME PAINS TO PROCURE
THAT LITTLE;--FOR THE REST OF THE PARTY NONE AT ALL.

AS MRS. JENNINGS COULD TALK ON NO OTHER SUBJECT,
ELINOR SOON SAW THE NECESSITY OF PREPARING MARIANNE FOR
ITS DISCUSSION.  NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST IN UNDECEIVING HER,
IN MAKING HER ACQUAINTED WITH THE REAL TRUTH, AND IN
ENDEAVOURING TO BRING HER TO HEAR IT TALKED OF BY OTHERS,
WITHOUT BETRAYING THAT SHE FELT ANY UNEASINESS FOR HER SISTER,
OR ANY RESENTMENT AGAINST EDWARD.

ELINOR'S OFFICE WAS A PAINFUL ONE.--SHE WAS GOING
TO REMOVE WHAT SHE REALLY BELIEVED TO BE HER SISTER'S
CHIEF CONSOLATION,--TO GIVE SUCH PARTICULARS OF EDWARD AS SHE
FEARED WOULD RUIN HIM FOR EVER IN HER GOOD OPINION,-AND
TO MAKE MARIANNE, BY A RESEMBLANCE IN THEIR SITUATIONS,
WHICH TO HER FANCY WOULD SEEM STRONG, FEEL ALL HER OWN
DISAPPOINTMENT OVER AGAIN.  BUT UNWELCOME AS SUCH A TASK
MUST BE, IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE DONE, AND ELINOR THEREFORE
HASTENED TO PERFORM IT.

SHE WAS VERY FAR FROM WISHING TO DWELL ON HER OWN
FEELINGS, OR TO REPRESENT HERSELF AS SUFFERING MUCH,
ANY OTHERWISE THAN AS THE SELF-COMMAND SHE HAD PRACTISED
SINCE HER FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF EDWARD'S ENGAGEMENT, MIGHT
SUGGEST A HINT OF WHAT WAS PRACTICABLE TO MARIANNE.
HER NARRATION WAS CLEAR AND SIMPLE; AND THOUGH IT COULD
NOT BE GIVEN WITHOUT EMOTION, IT WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED
BY VIOLENT AGITATION, NOR IMPETUOUS GRIEF.--THAT BELONGED
RATHER TO THE HEARER, FOR MARIANNE LISTENED WITH HORROR,
AND CRIED EXCESSIVELY.  ELINOR WAS TO BE THE COMFORTER
OF OTHERS IN HER OWN DISTRESSES, NO LESS THAN IN THEIRS;
AND ALL THE COMFORT THAT COULD BE GIVEN BY ASSURANCES
OF HER OWN COMPOSURE OF MIND, AND A VERY EARNEST
VINDICATION OF EDWARD FROM EVERY CHARGE BUT OF IMPRUDENCE,
WAS READILY OFFERED.

BUT MARIANNE FOR SOME TIME WOULD GIVE CREDIT TO NEITHER.
EDWARD SEEMED A SECOND WILLOUGHBY; AND ACKNOWLEDGING
AS ELINOR DID, THAT SHE HAD LOVED HIM MOST SINCERELY,
COULD SHE FEEL LESS THAN HERSELF!  AS FOR LUCY STEELE,
SHE CONSIDERED HER SO TOTALLY UNAMIABLE, SO ABSOLUTELY
INCAPABLE OF ATTACHING A SENSIBLE MAN, THAT SHE COULD
NOT BE PERSUADED AT FIRST TO BELIEVE, AND AFTERWARDS
TO PARDON, ANY FORMER AFFECTION OF EDWARD FOR HER.
SHE WOULD NOT EVEN ADMIT IT TO HAVE BEEN NATURAL;
AND ELINOR LEFT HER TO BE CONVINCED THAT IT WAS SO,
BY THAT WHICH ONLY COULD CONVINCE HER, A BETTER KNOWLEDGE
OF MANKIND.

HER FIRST COMMUNICATION HAD REACHED NO FARTHER THAN
TO STATE THE FACT OF THE ENGAGEMENT, AND THE LENGTH OF TIME
IT HAD EXISTED.--MARIANNE'S FEELINGS HAD THEN BROKEN IN,
AND PUT AN END TO ALL REGULARITY OF DETAIL; AND FOR SOME
TIME ALL THAT COULD BE DONE WAS TO SOOTHE HER DISTRESS,
LESSEN HER ALARMS, AND COMBAT HER RESENTMENT.  THE FIRST
QUESTION ON HER SIDE, WHICH LED TO FARTHER PARTICULARS,
WAS,

"HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN KNOWN TO YOU, ELINOR? HAS
HE WRITTEN TO YOU?"

"I HAVE KNOWN IT THESE FOUR MONTHS.  WHEN LUCY
FIRST CAME TO BARTON PARK LAST NOVEMBER, SHE TOLD ME
IN CONFIDENCE OF HER ENGAGEMENT."

AT THESE WORDS, MARIANNE'S EYES EXPRESSED THE ASTONISHMENT
WHICH HER LIPS COULD NOT UTTER.  AFTER A PAUSE OF WONDER,
SHE EXCLAIMED--

"FOUR MONTHS!--HAVE YOU KNOWN OF THIS FOUR MONTHS?"

ELINOR CONFIRMED IT.

"WHAT!--WHILE ATTENDING ME IN ALL MY MISERY, HAS THIS
BEEN ON YOUR HEART?--AND I HAVE REPROACHED YOU FOR BEING
HAPPY!"--

"IT WAS NOT FIT THAT YOU SHOULD THEN KNOW HOW MUCH
I WAS THE REVERSE!"

"FOUR MONTHS!"--CRIED MARIANNE AGAIN.--"SO CALM!--
SO CHEERFUL!--HOW HAVE YOU BEEN SUPPORTED?"--

"BY FEELING THAT I WAS DOING MY DUTY.--MY PROMISE TO
LUCY, OBLIGED ME TO BE SECRET.  I OWED IT TO HER, THEREFORE,
TO AVOID GIVING ANY HINT OF THE TRUTH; AND I OWED IT TO MY
FAMILY AND FRIENDS, NOT TO CREATE IN THEM A SOLICITUDE ABOUT ME,
WHICH IT COULD NOT BE IN MY POWER TO SATISFY."

MARIANNE SEEMED MUCH STRUCK.

"I HAVE VERY OFTEN WISHED TO UNDECEIVE YOURSELF AND MY
MOTHER," ADDED ELINOR; "AND ONCE OR TWICE I HAVE ATTEMPTED IT;--
BUT WITHOUT BETRAYING MY TRUST, I NEVER COULD HAVE CONVINCED
YOU."

"FOUR MONTHS!--AND YET YOU LOVED HIM!"--

"YES. BUT I DID NOT LOVE ONLY HIM;--AND WHILE THE COMFORT
OF OTHERS WAS DEAR TO ME, I WAS GLAD TO SPARE THEM FROM KNOWING
HOW MUCH I FELT.  NOW, I CAN THINK AND SPEAK OF IT WITH
LITTLE EMOTION.  I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU SUFFER ON MY ACCOUNT;
FOR I ASSURE YOU I NO LONGER SUFFER MATERIALLY MYSELF.
I HAVE MANY THINGS TO SUPPORT ME.  I AM NOT CONSCIOUS OF HAVING
PROVOKED THE DISAPPOINTMENT BY ANY IMPRUDENCE OF MY OWN,
I HAVE BORNE IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT SPREADING
IT FARTHER.  I ACQUIT EDWARD OF ESSENTIAL MISCONDUCT.
I WISH HIM VERY HAPPY; AND I AM SO SURE OF HIS ALWAYS
DOING HIS DUTY, THAT THOUGH NOW HE MAY HARBOUR SOME REGRET,
IN THE END HE MUST BECOME SO.  LUCY DOES NOT WANT SENSE,
AND THAT IS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH EVERY THING GOOD MAY
BE BUILT.--AND AFTER ALL, MARIANNE, AFTER ALL THAT IS
BEWITCHING IN THE IDEA OF A SINGLE AND CONSTANT ATTACHMENT,
AND ALL THAT CAN BE SAID OF ONE'S HAPPINESS DEPENDING
ENTIRELY ON ANY PARTICULAR PERSON, IT IS NOT MEANT--IT
IS NOT FIT--IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT IT SHOULD BE SO.--
EDWARD WILL MARRY LUCY; HE WILL MARRY A WOMAN SUPERIOR
IN PERSON AND UNDERSTANDING TO HALF HER SEX; AND TIME
AND HABIT WILL TEACH HIM TO FORGET THAT HE EVER THOUGHT
ANOTHER SUPERIOR TO HER."--

"IF SUCH IS YOUR WAY OF THINKING," SAID MARIANNE,
"IF THE LOSS OF WHAT IS MOST VALUED IS SO EASILY
TO BE MADE UP BY SOMETHING ELSE, YOUR RESOLUTION,
YOUR SELF-COMMAND, ARE, PERHAPS, A LITTLE LESS TO BE
WONDERED AT.--THEY ARE BROUGHT MORE WITHIN MY COMPREHENSION."

"I UNDERSTAND YOU.--YOU DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE EVER
FELT MUCH.--FOR FOUR MONTHS, MARIANNE, I HAVE HAD ALL THIS
HANGING ON MY MIND, WITHOUT BEING AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK
OF IT TO A SINGLE CREATURE; KNOWING THAT IT WOULD MAKE
YOU AND MY MOTHER MOST UNHAPPY WHENEVER IT WERE EXPLAINED
TO YOU, YET UNABLE TO PREPARE YOU FOR IT IN THE LEAST.--
IT WAS TOLD ME,--IT WAS IN A MANNER FORCED ON ME BY THE
VERY PERSON HERSELF, WHOSE PRIOR ENGAGEMENT RUINED ALL
MY PROSPECTS; AND TOLD ME, AS I THOUGHT, WITH TRIUMPH.--
THIS PERSON'S SUSPICIONS, THEREFORE, I HAVE HAD TO OPPOSE,
BY ENDEAVOURING TO APPEAR INDIFFERENT WHERE I HAVE BEEN MOST
DEEPLY INTERESTED;--AND IT HAS NOT BEEN ONLY ONCE;--I HAVE
HAD HER HOPES AND EXULTATION TO LISTEN TO AGAIN AND AGAIN.--
I HAVE KNOWN MYSELF TO BE DIVIDED FROM EDWARD FOR EVER,
WITHOUT HEARING ONE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT COULD MAKE ME LESS
DESIRE THE CONNECTION.--NOTHING HAS PROVED HIM UNWORTHY;
NOR HAS ANYTHING DECLARED HIM INDIFFERENT TO ME.--
I HAVE HAD TO CONTEND AGAINST THE UNKINDNESS OF HIS SISTER,
AND THE INSOLENCE OF HIS MOTHER; AND HAVE SUFFERED THE
PUNISHMENT OF AN ATTACHMENT, WITHOUT ENJOYING ITS ADVANTAGES.--
AND ALL THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON AT A TIME, WHEN, AS YOU
KNOW TOO WELL, IT HAS NOT BEEN MY ONLY UNHAPPINESS.--
IF YOU CAN THINK ME CAPABLE OF EVER FEELING--SURELY YOU
MAY SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE SUFFERED NOW.  THE COMPOSURE
OF MIND WITH WHICH I HAVE BROUGHT MYSELF AT PRESENT
TO CONSIDER THE MATTER, THE CONSOLATION THAT I HAVE BEEN
WILLING TO ADMIT, HAVE BEEN THE EFFECT OF CONSTANT AND
PAINFUL EXERTION;--THEY DID NOT SPRING UP OF THEMSELVES;--
THEY DID NOT OCCUR TO RELIEVE MY SPIRITS AT FIRST.--
NO, MARIANNE.--THEN, IF I HAD NOT BEEN BOUND TO SILENCE,
PERHAPS NOTHING COULD HAVE KEPT ME ENTIRELY--NOT EVEN WHAT I
OWED TO MY DEAREST FRIENDS--FROM OPENLY SHEWING THAT I WAS
VERY UNHAPPY."--

MARIANNE WAS QUITE SUBDUED.--

"OH! ELINOR," SHE CRIED, "YOU HAVE MADE ME HATE
MYSELF FOR EVER.--HOW BARBAROUS HAVE I BEEN TO YOU!--
YOU, WHO HAVE BEEN MY ONLY COMFORT, WHO HAVE BORNE WITH ME
IN ALL MY MISERY, WHO HAVE SEEMED TO BE ONLY SUFFERING
FOR ME!--IS THIS MY GRATITUDE?--IS THIS THE ONLY RETURN I
CAN MAKE YOU?--BECAUSE YOUR MERIT CRIES OUT UPON MYSELF,
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT AWAY."

THE TENDEREST CARESSES FOLLOWED THIS CONFESSION.
IN SUCH A FRAME OF MIND AS SHE WAS NOW IN, ELINOR HAD
NO DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING FROM HER WHATEVER PROMISE
SHE REQUIRED; AND AT HER REQUEST, MARIANNE ENGAGED
NEVER TO SPEAK OF THE AFFAIR TO ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST
APPEARANCE OF BITTERNESS;--TO MEET LUCY WITHOUT BETRAYING
THE SMALLEST INCREASE OF DISLIKE TO HER;--AND EVEN TO SEE
EDWARD HIMSELF, IF CHANCE SHOULD BRING THEM TOGETHER,
WITHOUT ANY DIMINUTION OF HER USUAL CORDIALITY.--
THESE WERE GREAT CONCESSIONS;--BUT WHERE MARIANNE FELT
THAT SHE HAD INJURED, NO REPARATION COULD BE TOO MUCH
FOR HER TO MAKE.

SHE PERFORMED HER PROMISE OF BEING DISCREET,
TO ADMIRATION.--SHE ATTENDED TO ALL THAT MRS. JENNINGS
HAD TO SAY UPON THE SUBJECT, WITH AN UNCHANGING COMPLEXION,
DISSENTED FROM HER IN NOTHING, AND WAS HEARD THREE
TIMES TO SAY, "YES, MA'AM."--SHE LISTENED TO HER PRAISE
OF LUCY WITH ONLY MOVING FROM ONE CHAIR TO ANOTHER,
AND WHEN MRS. JENNINGS TALKED OF EDWARD'S AFFECTION,
IT COST HER ONLY A SPASM IN HER THROAT.--SUCH ADVANCES
TOWARDS HEROISM IN HER SISTER, MADE ELINOR FEEL EQUAL
TO ANY THING HERSELF.

THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT A FARTHER TRIAL OF IT,
IN A VISIT FROM THEIR BROTHER, WHO CAME WITH A MOST SERIOUS
ASPECT TO TALK OVER THE DREADFUL AFFAIR, AND BRING THEM
NEWS OF HIS WIFE.

"YOU HAVE HEARD, I SUPPOSE," SAID HE WITH GREAT SOLEMNITY,
AS SOON AS HE WAS SEATED, "OF THE VERY SHOCKING DISCOVERY
THAT TOOK PLACE UNDER OUR ROOF YESTERDAY."

THEY ALL LOOKED THEIR ASSENT; IT SEEMED TOO AWFUL
A MOMENT FOR SPEECH.

"YOUR SISTER," HE CONTINUED, "HAS SUFFERED DREADFULLY.
MRS. FERRARS TOO--IN SHORT IT HAS BEEN A SCENE OF SUCH
COMPLICATED DISTRESS--BUT I WILL HOPE THAT THE STORM MAY
BE WEATHERED WITHOUT OUR BEING ANY OF US QUITE OVERCOME.
POOR FANNY! SHE WAS IN HYSTERICS ALL YESTERDAY.
BUT I WOULD NOT ALARM YOU TOO MUCH.  DONAVAN SAYS THERE
IS NOTHING MATERIALLY TO BE APPREHENDED; HER CONSTITUTION
IS A GOOD ONE, AND HER RESOLUTION EQUAL TO ANY THING.
SHE HAS BORNE IT ALL, WITH THE FORTITUDE OF AN ANGEL!
SHE SAYS SHE NEVER SHALL THINK WELL OF ANYBODY AGAIN;
AND ONE CANNOT WONDER AT IT, AFTER BEING SO DECEIVED!--
MEETING WITH SUCH INGRATITUDE, WHERE SO MUCH KINDNESS
HAD BEEN SHEWN, SO MUCH CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN PLACED!  IT
WAS QUITE OUT OF THE BENEVOLENCE OF HER HEART, THAT SHE
HAD ASKED THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO HER HOUSE; MERELY BECAUSE
SHE THOUGHT THEY DESERVED SOME ATTENTION, WERE HARMLESS,
WELL-BEHAVED GIRLS, AND WOULD BE PLEASANT COMPANIONS;
FOR OTHERWISE WE BOTH WISHED VERY MUCH TO HAVE INVITED YOU
AND MARIANNE TO BE WITH US, WHILE YOUR KIND FRIEND THERE,
WAS ATTENDING HER DAUGHTER.  AND NOW TO BE SO REWARDED!
'I WISH, WITH ALL MY HEART,' SAYS POOR FANNY IN HER
AFFECTIONATE WAY, 'THAT WE HAD ASKED YOUR SISTERS INSTEAD
OF THEM.'"

HERE HE STOPPED TO BE THANKED; WHICH BEING DONE,
HE WENT ON.

"WHAT POOR MRS. FERRARS SUFFERED, WHEN FIRST FANNY
BROKE IT TO HER, IS NOT TO BE DESCRIBED.  WHILE SHE WITH
THE TRUEST AFFECTION HAD BEEN PLANNING A MOST ELIGIBLE
CONNECTION FOR HIM, WAS IT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT HE COULD
BE ALL THE TIME SECRETLY ENGAGED TO ANOTHER PERSON!--SUCH
A SUSPICION COULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED HER HEAD!  IF SHE
SUSPECTED ANY PREPOSSESSION ELSEWHERE, IT COULD NOT BE
IN THAT QUARTER.  'THERE, TO BE SURE,' SAID SHE, 'I MIGHT
HAVE THOUGHT MYSELF SAFE.' SHE WAS QUITE IN AN AGONY.
WE CONSULTED TOGETHER, HOWEVER, AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE,
AND AT LAST SHE DETERMINED TO SEND FOR EDWARD.
HE CAME.  BUT I AM SORRY TO RELATE WHAT ENSUED.
ALL THAT MRS. FERRARS COULD SAY TO MAKE HIM PUT AN END
TO THE ENGAGEMENT, ASSISTED TOO AS YOU MAY WELL SUPPOSE
BY MY ARGUMENTS, AND FANNY'S ENTREATIES, WAS OF
NO AVAIL.  DUTY, AFFECTION, EVERY THING WAS DISREGARDED.
I NEVER THOUGHT EDWARD SO STUBBORN, SO UNFEELING BEFORE.
HIS MOTHER EXPLAINED TO HIM HER LIBERAL DESIGNS, IN CASE
OF HIS MARRYING MISS MORTON; TOLD HIM SHE WOULD SETTLE ON
HIM THE NORFOLK ESTATE, WHICH, CLEAR OF LAND-TAX, BRINGS
IN A GOOD THOUSAND A-YEAR; OFFERED EVEN, WHEN MATTERS
GREW DESPERATE, TO MAKE IT TWELVE HUNDRED; AND IN OPPOSITION
TO THIS, IF HE STILL PERSISTED IN THIS LOW CONNECTION,
REPRESENTED TO HIM THE CERTAIN PENURY THAT MUST ATTEND
THE MATCH.  HIS OWN TWO THOUSAND POUNDS SHE PROTESTED
SHOULD BE HIS ALL; SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN; AND SO FAR
WOULD SHE BE FROM AFFORDING HIM THE SMALLEST ASSISTANCE,
THAT IF HE WERE TO ENTER INTO ANY PROFESSION WITH A VIEW
OF BETTER SUPPORT, SHE WOULD DO ALL IN HER POWER TO PREVENT
HIM ADVANCING IN IT."

HERE MARIANNE, IN AN ECSTASY OF INDIGNATION,
CLAPPED HER HANDS TOGETHER, AND CRIED, "GRACIOUS GOD!
CAN THIS BE POSSIBLE!"

"WELL MAY YOU WONDER, MARIANNE," REPLIED HER BROTHER,
"AT THE OBSTINACY WHICH COULD RESIST SUCH ARGUMENTS AS THESE.
YOUR EXCLAMATION IS VERY NATURAL."

MARIANNE WAS GOING TO RETORT, BUT SHE REMEMBERED
HER PROMISES, AND FORBORE.

"ALL THIS, HOWEVER," HE CONTINUED, "WAS URGED IN VAIN.
EDWARD SAID VERY LITTLE; BUT WHAT HE DID SAY, WAS IN
THE MOST DETERMINED MANNER.  NOTHING SHOULD PREVAIL ON
HIM TO GIVE UP HIS ENGAGEMENT.  HE WOULD STAND TO IT,
COST HIM WHAT IT MIGHT."

"THEN," CRIED MRS. JENNINGS WITH BLUNT SINCERITY,
NO LONGER ABLE TO BE SILENT, "HE HAS ACTED LIKE AN HONEST
MAN! I BEG YOUR PARDON, MR. DASHWOOD, BUT IF HE HAD
DONE OTHERWISE, I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIM A RASCAL.
I HAVE SOME LITTLE CONCERN IN THE BUSINESS, AS WELL
AS YOURSELF, FOR LUCY STEELE IS MY COUSIN, AND I BELIEVE
THERE IS NOT A BETTER KIND OF GIRL IN THE WORLD, NOR ONE
WHO MORE DESERVES A GOOD HUSBAND."

JOHN DASHWOOD WAS GREATLY ASTONISHED; BUT HIS NATURE
WAS CALM, NOT OPEN TO PROVOCATION, AND HE NEVER WISHED
TO OFFEND ANYBODY, ESPECIALLY ANYBODY OF GOOD FORTUNE.
HE THEREFORE REPLIED, WITHOUT ANY RESENTMENT,

"I WOULD BY NO MEANS SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF ANY
RELATION OF YOURS, MADAM.  MISS LUCY STEELE IS, I DARE SAY,
A VERY DESERVING YOUNG WOMAN, BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE
YOU KNOW, THE CONNECTION MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE.
AND TO HAVE ENTERED INTO A SECRET ENGAGEMENT WITH A
YOUNG MAN UNDER HER UNCLE'S CARE, THE SON OF A WOMAN
ESPECIALLY OF SUCH VERY LARGE FORTUNE AS MRS. FERRARS,
IS PERHAPS, ALTOGETHER A LITTLE EXTRAORDINARY. IN SHORT,
I DO NOT MEAN TO REFLECT UPON THE BEHAVIOUR OF ANY PERSON
WHOM YOU HAVE A REGARD FOR, MRS. JENNINGS.  WE ALL WISH
HER EXTREMELY HAPPY; AND MRS. FERRARS'S CONDUCT THROUGHOUT
THE WHOLE, HAS BEEN SUCH AS EVERY CONSCIENTIOUS, GOOD MOTHER,
IN LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD ADOPT.  IT HAS BEEN DIGNIFIED
AND LIBERAL.  EDWARD HAS DRAWN HIS OWN LOT, AND I FEAR
IT WILL BE A BAD ONE."

MARIANNE SIGHED OUT HER SIMILAR APPREHENSION;
AND ELINOR'S HEART WRUNG FOR THE FEELINGS OF EDWARD,
WHILE BRAVING HIS MOTHER'S THREATS, FOR A WOMAN WHO COULD
NOT REWARD HIM.

"WELL, SIR," SAID MRS. JENNINGS, "AND HOW DID IT END?"

"I AM SORRY TO SAY, MA'AM, IN A MOST UNHAPPY RUPTURE:--
EDWARD IS DISMISSED FOR EVER FROM HIS MOTHER'S NOTICE.
HE LEFT HER HOUSE YESTERDAY, BUT WHERE HE IS GONE, OR WHETHER
HE IS STILL IN TOWN, I DO NOT KNOW; FOR WE OF COURSE CAN
MAKE NO INQUIRY."

"POOR YOUNG MAN!--AND WHAT IS TO BECOME OF HIM?"

"WHAT, INDEED, MA'AM!  IT IS A MELANCHOLY CONSIDERATION.
BORN TO THE PROSPECT OF SUCH AFFLUENCE!  I CANNOT CONCEIVE
A SITUATION MORE DEPLORABLE.  THE INTEREST OF TWO THOUSAND
POUNDS--HOW CAN A MAN LIVE ON IT?--AND WHEN TO THAT IS ADDED
THE RECOLLECTION, THAT HE MIGHT, BUT FOR HIS OWN FOLLY,
WITHIN THREE MONTHS HAVE BEEN IN THE RECEIPT OF TWO
THOUSAND, FIVE HUNDRED A-YEAR (FOR MISS MORTON HAS
THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS,) I CANNOT PICTURE TO MYSELF
A MORE WRETCHED CONDITION.  WE MUST ALL FEEL FOR HIM;
AND THE MORE SO, BECAUSE IT IS TOTALLY OUT OF OUR POWER
TO ASSIST HIM."

"POOR YOUNG MAN!" CRIED MRS. JENNINGS, "I AM SURE
HE SHOULD BE VERY WELCOME TO BED AND BOARD AT MY HOUSE;
AND SO I WOULD TELL HIM IF I COULD SEE HIM.  IT IS NOT FIT
THAT HE SHOULD BE LIVING ABOUT AT HIS OWN CHARGE NOW,
AT LODGINGS AND TAVERNS."

ELINOR'S HEART THANKED HER FOR SUCH KINDNESS TOWARDS EDWARD,
THOUGH SHE COULD NOT FORBEAR SMILING AT THE FORM OF IT.

"IF HE WOULD ONLY HAVE DONE AS WELL BY HIMSELF,"
SAID JOHN DASHWOOD, "AS ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE DISPOSED TO DO
BY HIM, HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN IN HIS PROPER SITUATION,
AND WOULD HAVE WANTED FOR NOTHING.  BUT AS IT IS, IT MUST
BE OUT OF ANYBODY'S POWER TO ASSIST HIM.  AND THERE IS ONE
THING MORE PREPARING AGAINST HIM, WHICH MUST BE WORSE THAN
ALL--HIS MOTHER HAS DETERMINED, WITH A VERY NATURAL KIND
OF SPIRIT, TO SETTLE THAT ESTATE UPON ROBERT IMMEDIATELY,
WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EDWARD'S, ON PROPER CONDITIONS.
I LEFT HER THIS MORNING WITH HER LAWYER, TALKING OVER
THE BUSINESS."

"WELL!" SAID MRS. JENNINGS, "THAT IS HER REVENGE.
EVERYBODY HAS A WAY OF THEIR OWN.  BUT I DON'T THINK MINE
WOULD BE, TO MAKE ONE SON INDEPENDENT, BECAUSE ANOTHER HAD
PLAGUED ME."

MARIANNE GOT UP AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM.

"CAN ANYTHING BE MORE GALLING TO THE SPIRIT OF A MAN,"
CONTINUED JOHN, "THAN TO SEE HIS YOUNGER BROTHER IN
POSSESSION OF AN ESTATE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS OWN?
POOR EDWARD!  I FEEL FOR HIM SINCERELY."

A FEW MINUTES MORE SPENT IN THE SAME KIND OF EFFUSION,
CONCLUDED HIS VISIT; AND WITH REPEATED ASSURANCES TO HIS
SISTERS THAT HE REALLY BELIEVED THERE WAS NO MATERIAL
DANGER IN FANNY'S INDISPOSITION, AND THAT THEY NEED
NOT THEREFORE BE VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT, HE WENT AWAY;
LEAVING THE THREE LADIES UNANIMOUS IN THEIR SENTIMENTS
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION, AS FAR AT LEAST AS IT REGARDED
MRS. FERRARS'S CONDUCT, THE DASHWOODS', AND EDWARD'S.

MARIANNE'S INDIGNATION BURST FORTH AS SOON AS HE
QUITTED THE ROOM; AND AS HER VEHEMENCE MADE RESERVE
IMPOSSIBLE IN ELINOR, AND UNNECESSARY IN MRS. JENNINGS,
THEY ALL JOINED IN A VERY SPIRITED CRITIQUE UPON THE PARTY.



CHAPTER 38


MRS. JENNINGS WAS VERY WARM IN HER PRAISE OF EDWARD'S
CONDUCT, BUT ONLY ELINOR AND MARIANNE UNDERSTOOD ITS
TRUE MERIT.  THEY ONLY KNEW HOW LITTLE HE HAD HAD TO TEMPT
HIM TO BE DISOBEDIENT, AND HOW SMALL WAS THE CONSOLATION,
BEYOND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DOING RIGHT, THAT COULD
REMAIN TO HIM IN THE LOSS OF FRIENDS AND FORTUNE.
ELINOR GLORIED IN HIS INTEGRITY; AND MARIANNE FORGAVE ALL
HIS OFFENCES IN COMPASSION FOR HIS PUNISHMENT.  BUT THOUGH
CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THEM WAS, BY THIS PUBLIC DISCOVERY,
RESTORED TO ITS PROPER STATE, IT WAS NOT A SUBJECT ON
WHICH EITHER OF THEM WERE FOND OF DWELLING WHEN ALONE.
ELINOR AVOIDED IT UPON PRINCIPLE, AS TENDING TO FIX STILL
MORE UPON HER THOUGHTS, BY THE TOO WARM, TOO POSITIVE
ASSURANCES OF MARIANNE, THAT BELIEF OF EDWARD'S CONTINUED
AFFECTION FOR HERSELF WHICH SHE RATHER WISHED TO DO AWAY;
AND MARIANNE'S COURAGE SOON FAILED HER, IN TRYING
TO CONVERSE UPON A TOPIC WHICH ALWAYS LEFT HER MORE
DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF THAN EVER, BY THE COMPARISON
IT NECESSARILY PRODUCED BETWEEN ELINOR'S CONDUCT AND HER OWN.

SHE FELT ALL THE FORCE OF THAT COMPARISON; BUT NOT
AS HER SISTER HAD HOPED, TO URGE HER TO EXERTION NOW;
SHE FELT IT WITH ALL THE PAIN OF CONTINUAL SELF-REPROACH,
REGRETTED MOST BITTERLY THAT SHE HAD NEVER EXERTED
HERSELF BEFORE; BUT IT BROUGHT ONLY THE TORTURE OF PENITENCE,
WITHOUT THE HOPE OF AMENDMENT.  HER MIND WAS SO MUCH WEAKENED
THAT SHE STILL FANCIED PRESENT EXERTION IMPOSSIBLE,
AND THEREFORE IT ONLY DISPIRITED HER MORE.

NOTHING NEW WAS HEARD BY THEM, FOR A DAY OR TWO AFTERWARDS,
OF AFFAIRS IN HARLEY STREET, OR BARTLETT'S BUILDINGS.
BUT THOUGH SO MUCH OF THE MATTER WAS KNOWN TO THEM ALREADY,
THAT MRS. JENNINGS MIGHT HAVE HAD ENOUGH TO DO IN SPREADING
THAT KNOWLEDGE FARTHER, WITHOUT SEEKING AFTER MORE,
SHE HAD RESOLVED FROM THE FIRST TO PAY A VISIT OF COMFORT
AND INQUIRY TO HER COUSINS AS SOON AS SHE COULD;
AND NOTHING BUT THE HINDRANCE OF MORE VISITORS THAN USUAL,
HAD PREVENTED HER GOING TO THEM WITHIN THAT TIME.

THE THIRD DAY SUCCEEDING THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE
PARTICULARS, WAS SO FINE, SO BEAUTIFUL A SUNDAY AS TO DRAW
MANY TO KENSINGTON GARDENS, THOUGH IT WAS ONLY THE SECOND
WEEK IN MARCH.  MRS. JENNINGS AND ELINOR WERE OF THE NUMBER;
BUT MARIANNE, WHO KNEW THAT THE WILLOUGHBYS WERE AGAIN
IN TOWN, AND HAD A CONSTANT DREAD OF MEETING THEM,
CHOSE RATHER TO STAY AT HOME, THAN VENTURE INTO SO PUBLIC
A PLACE.

AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE OF MRS. JENNINGS JOINED
THEM SOON AFTER THEY ENTERED THE GARDENS, AND ELINOR WAS
NOT SORRY THAT BY HER CONTINUING WITH THEM, AND ENGAGING
ALL MRS. JENNINGS'S CONVERSATION, SHE WAS HERSELF LEFT
TO QUIET REFLECTION.  SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE WILLOUGHBYS,
NOTHING OF EDWARD, AND FOR SOME TIME NOTHING OF ANYBODY
WHO COULD BY ANY CHANCE WHETHER GRAVE OR GAY, BE INTERESTING
TO HER.  BUT AT LAST SHE FOUND HERSELF WITH SOME SURPRISE,
ACCOSTED BY MISS STEELE, WHO, THOUGH LOOKING RATHER SHY,
EXPRESSED GREAT SATISFACTION IN MEETING THEM, AND ON RECEIVING
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE PARTICULAR KINDNESS OF MRS. JENNINGS,
LEFT HER OWN PARTY FOR A SHORT TIME, TO JOIN THEIR'S.
MRS. JENNINGS IMMEDIATELY WHISPERED TO ELINOR,

"GET IT ALL OUT OF HER, MY DEAR.  SHE WILL TELL YOU
ANY THING IF YOU ASK.  YOU SEE I CANNOT LEAVE MRS. CLARKE."

IT WAS LUCKY, HOWEVER, FOR MRS. JENNINGS'S CURIOSITY
AND ELINOR'S TOO, THAT SHE WOULD TELL ANY THING WITHOUT
BEING ASKED; FOR NOTHING WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN LEARNT.

"I AM SO GLAD TO MEET YOU;" SAID MISS STEELE,
TAKING HER FAMILIARLY BY THE ARM--"FOR I WANTED TO SEE YOU
OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD."  AND THEN LOWERING HER VOICE,
"I SUPPOSE MRS. JENNINGS HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT IT.
IS SHE ANGRY?"

"NOT AT ALL, I BELIEVE, WITH YOU."

"THAT IS A GOOD THING.  AND LADY MIDDLETON, IS SHE ANGRY?"

"I CANNOT SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD."

"I AM MONSTROUS GLAD OF IT.  GOOD GRACIOUS!  I HAVE
HAD SUCH A TIME OF IT!  I NEVER SAW LUCY IN SUCH A RAGE
IN MY LIFE.  SHE VOWED AT FIRST SHE WOULD NEVER TRIM ME
UP A NEW BONNET, NOR DO ANY THING ELSE FOR ME AGAIN,
SO LONG AS SHE LIVED; BUT NOW SHE IS QUITE COME TO,
AND WE ARE AS GOOD FRIENDS AS EVER.  LOOK, SHE MADE ME
THIS BOW TO MY HAT, AND PUT IN THE FEATHER LAST NIGHT.
THERE NOW, YOU ARE GOING TO LAUGH AT ME TOO.  BUT WHY
SHOULD NOT I WEAR PINK RIBBONS?  I DO NOT CARE IF IT IS
THE DOCTOR'S FAVOURITE COLOUR.  I AM SURE, FOR MY PART,
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN HE DID LIKE IT BETTER THAN
ANY OTHER COLOUR, IF HE HAD NOT HAPPENED TO SAY SO.
MY COUSINS HAVE BEEN SO PLAGUING ME!  I DECLARE SOMETIMES
I DO NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO LOOK BEFORE THEM."

SHE HAD WANDERED AWAY TO A SUBJECT ON WHICH ELINOR
HAD NOTHING TO SAY, AND THEREFORE SOON JUDGED IT EXPEDIENT
TO FIND HER WAY BACK AGAIN TO THE FIRST.

"WELL, BUT MISS DASHWOOD," SPEAKING TRIUMPHANTLY,
"PEOPLE MAY SAY WHAT THEY CHUSE ABOUT MR. FERRARS'S
DECLARING HE WOULD NOT HAVE LUCY, FOR IT IS NO SUCH THING
I CAN TELL YOU; AND IT IS QUITE A SHAME FOR SUCH ILL-NATURED
REPORTS TO BE SPREAD ABROAD.  WHATEVER LUCY MIGHT THINK
ABOUT IT HERSELF, YOU KNOW, IT WAS NO BUSINESS OF OTHER
PEOPLE TO SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN."

"I NEVER HEARD ANY THING OF THE KIND HINTED AT BEFORE,
I ASSURE YOU," SAID ELINOR.

"OH, DID NOT YOU?  BUT IT WAS SAID, I KNOW, VERY WELL,
AND BY MORE THAN ONE; FOR MISS GODBY TOLD MISS SPARKS,
THAT NOBODY IN THEIR SENSES COULD EXPECT MR. FERRARS
TO GIVE UP A WOMAN LIKE MISS MORTON, WITH THIRTY THOUSAND
POUNDS TO HER FORTUNE, FOR LUCY STEELE THAT HAD
NOTHING AT ALL; AND I HAD IT FROM MISS SPARKS MYSELF.
AND BESIDES THAT, MY COUSIN RICHARD SAID HIMSELF,
THAT WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT HE WAS AFRAID MR. FERRARS
WOULD BE OFF; AND WHEN EDWARD DID NOT COME NEAR US
FOR THREE DAYS, I COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO THINK MYSELF;
AND I BELIEVE IN MY HEART LUCY GAVE IT UP ALL FOR LOST;
FOR WE CAME AWAY FROM YOUR BROTHER'S WEDNESDAY,
AND WE SAW NOTHING OF HIM NOT ALL THURSDAY, FRIDAY,
AND SATURDAY, AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS BECOME OF HIM.
ONCE LUCY THOUGHT TO WRITE TO HIM, BUT THEN HER SPIRITS
ROSE AGAINST THAT.  HOWEVER THIS MORNING HE CAME JUST
AS WE CAME HOME FROM CHURCH; AND THEN IT ALL CAME OUT,
HOW HE HAD BEEN SENT FOR WEDNESDAY TO HARLEY STREET,
AND BEEN TALKED TO BY HIS MOTHER AND ALL OF THEM,
AND HOW HE HAD DECLARED BEFORE THEM ALL THAT HE LOVED
NOBODY BUT LUCY, AND NOBODY BUT LUCY WOULD HE HAVE.
AND HOW HE HAD BEEN SO WORRIED BY WHAT PASSED,
THAT AS SOON AS HE HAD WENT AWAY FROM HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE,
HE HAD GOT UPON HIS HORSE, AND RID INTO THE COUNTRY,
SOME WHERE OR OTHER; AND HOW HE HAD STAYED ABOUT AT AN INN
ALL THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, ON PURPOSE TO GET THE BETTER
OF IT.  AND AFTER THINKING IT ALL OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
HE SAID, IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF, NOW HE HAD NO FORTUNE,
AND NO NOTHING AT ALL, IT WOULD BE QUITE UNKIND TO KEEP
HER ON TO THE ENGAGEMENT, BECAUSE IT MUST BE FOR HER LOSS,
FOR HE HAD NOTHING BUT TWO THOUSAND POUNDS, AND NO HOPE
OF ANY THING ELSE; AND IF HE WAS TO GO INTO ORDERS,
AS HE HAD SOME THOUGHTS, HE COULD GET NOTHING BUT A CURACY,
AND HOW WAS THEY TO LIVE UPON THAT?--HE COULD NOT BEAR
TO THINK OF HER DOING NO BETTER, AND SO HE BEGGED,
IF SHE HAD THE LEAST MIND FOR IT, TO PUT AN END TO THE
MATTER DIRECTLY, AND LEAVE HIM SHIFT FOR HIMSELF.
I HEARD HIM SAY ALL THIS AS PLAIN AS COULD POSSIBLY BE.
AND IT WAS ENTIRELY FOR HER SAKE, AND UPON HER ACCOUNT,
THAT HE SAID A WORD ABOUT BEING OFF, AND NOT UPON HIS OWN.
I WILL TAKE MY OATH HE NEVER DROPT A SYLLABLE OF BEING
TIRED OF HER, OR OF WISHING TO MARRY MISS MORTON, OR ANY
THING LIKE IT.  BUT, TO BE SURE, LUCY WOULD NOT GIVE
EAR TO SUCH KIND OF TALKING; SO SHE TOLD HIM DIRECTLY
(WITH A GREAT DEAL ABOUT SWEET AND LOVE, YOU KNOW,
AND ALL THAT--OH, LA! ONE CAN'T REPEAT SUCH KIND OF THINGS
YOU KNOW)--SHE TOLD HIM DIRECTLY, SHE HAD NOT THE LEAST
MIND IN THE WORLD TO BE OFF, FOR SHE COULD LIVE WITH HIM
UPON A TRIFLE, AND HOW LITTLE SO EVER HE MIGHT HAVE,
SHE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE IT ALL, YOU KNOW,
OR SOMETHING OF THE KIND.  SO THEN HE WAS MONSTROUS HAPPY,
AND TALKED ON SOME TIME ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO,
AND THEY AGREED HE SHOULD TAKE ORDERS DIRECTLY,
AND THEY MUST WAIT TO BE MARRIED TILL HE GOT A LIVING.
AND JUST THEN I COULD NOT HEAR ANY MORE, FOR MY COUSIN
CALLED FROM BELOW TO TELL ME MRS. RICHARDSON WAS COME IN
HER COACH, AND WOULD TAKE ONE OF US TO KENSINGTON GARDENS;
SO I WAS FORCED TO GO INTO THE ROOM AND INTERRUPT THEM,
TO ASK LUCY IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO, BUT SHE DID NOT
CARE TO LEAVE EDWARD; SO I JUST RUN UP STAIRS AND PUT
ON A PAIR OF SILK STOCKINGS AND CAME OFF WITH THE RICHARDSONS."

"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY INTERRUPTING THEM,"
SAID ELINOR; "YOU WERE ALL IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER,
WERE NOT YOU?"

"NO, INDEED, NOT US.  LA! MISS DASHWOOD, DO YOU
THINK PEOPLE MAKE LOVE WHEN ANY BODY ELSE IS BY?  OH,
FOR SHAME!--TO BE SURE YOU MUST KNOW BETTER THAN THAT.
(LAUGHING AFFECTEDLY.)--NO, NO; THEY WERE SHUT UP IN THE
DRAWING-ROOM TOGETHER, AND ALL I HEARD WAS ONLY BY LISTENING
AT THE DOOR."

"HOW!" CRIED ELINOR; "HAVE YOU BEEN REPEATING TO ME
WHAT YOU ONLY LEARNT YOURSELF BY LISTENING AT THE DOOR?
I AM SORRY I DID NOT KNOW IT BEFORE; FOR I CERTAINLY
WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFERED YOU TO GIVE ME PARTICULARS OF A
CONVERSATION WHICH YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE KNOWN YOURSELF.
HOW COULD YOU BEHAVE SO UNFAIRLY BY YOUR SISTER?"

"OH, LA! THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT.  I ONLY STOOD AT
THE DOOR, AND HEARD WHAT I COULD.  AND I AM SURE LUCY WOULD
HAVE DONE JUST THE SAME BY ME; FOR A YEAR OR TWO BACK,
WHEN MARTHA SHARPE AND I HAD SO MANY SECRETS TOGETHER,
SHE NEVER MADE ANY BONES OF HIDING IN A CLOSET, OR BEHIND
A CHIMNEY-BOARD, ON PURPOSE TO HEAR WHAT WE SAID."

ELINOR TRIED TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE; BUT MISS
STEELE COULD NOT BE KEPT BEYOND A COUPLE OF MINUTES,
FROM WHAT WAS UPPERMOST IN HER MIND.

"EDWARD TALKS OF GOING TO OXFORD SOON," SAID SHE;
"BUT NOW HE IS LODGING AT NO. --, PALL MALL.  WHAT AN
ILL-NATURED WOMAN HIS MOTHER IS, AN'T SHE? AND YOUR
BROTHER AND SISTER WERE NOT VERY KIND! HOWEVER,
I SHAN'T SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THEM TO YOU; AND TO BE SURE
THEY DID SEND US HOME IN THEIR OWN CHARIOT, WHICH
WAS MORE THAN I LOOKED FOR.  AND FOR MY PART, I WAS ALL
IN A FRIGHT FOR FEAR YOUR SISTER SHOULD ASK US FOR THE
HUSWIFES SHE HAD GAVE US A DAY OR TWO BEFORE; BUT, HOWEVER,
NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT THEM, AND I TOOK CARE TO KEEP MINE
OUT OF SIGHT.  EDWARD HAVE GOT SOME BUSINESS AT OXFORD,
HE SAYS; SO HE MUST GO THERE FOR A TIME; AND AFTER THAT,
AS SOON AS HE CAN LIGHT UPON A BISHOP, HE WILL BE ORDAINED.
I WONDER WHAT CURACY HE WILL GET!--GOOD GRACIOUS!
(GIGGLING AS SHE SPOKE) I'D LAY MY LIFE I KNOW WHAT
MY COUSINS WILL SAY, WHEN THEY HEAR OF IT.  THEY WILL
TELL ME I SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR, TO GET EDWARD
THE CURACY OF HIS NEW LIVING.  I KNOW THEY WILL; BUT I AM
SURE I WOULD NOT DO SUCH A THING FOR ALL THE WORLD.--
'LA!' I SHALL SAY DIRECTLY, 'I WONDER HOW YOU COULD THINK
OF SUCH A THING?  I WRITE TO THE DOCTOR, INDEED!'"

"WELL," SAID ELINOR, "IT IS A COMFORT TO BE PREPARED
AGAINST THE WORST.  YOU HAVE GOT YOUR ANSWER READY."

MISS STEELE WAS GOING TO REPLY ON THE SAME SUBJECT,
BUT THE APPROACH OF HER OWN PARTY MADE ANOTHER MORE NECESSARY.

"OH, LA! HERE COME THE RICHARDSONS.  I HAD A VAST DEAL
MORE TO SAY TO YOU, BUT I MUST NOT STAY AWAY FROM THEM NOT
ANY LONGER.  I ASSURE YOU THEY ARE VERY GENTEEL PEOPLE.
HE MAKES A MONSTROUS DEAL OF MONEY, AND THEY KEEP THEIR
OWN COACH.  I HAVE NOT TIME TO SPEAK TO MRS. JENNINGS ABOUT
IT MYSELF, BUT PRAY TELL HER I AM QUITE HAPPY TO HEAR SHE
IS NOT IN ANGER AGAINST US, AND LADY MIDDLETON THE SAME;
AND IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO TAKE YOU AND YOUR
SISTER AWAY, AND MRS. JENNINGS SHOULD WANT COMPANY,
I AM SURE WE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO COME AND STAY WITH HER
FOR AS LONG A TIME AS SHE LIKES.  I SUPPOSE LADY MIDDLETON
WON'T ASK US ANY MORE THIS BOUT.  GOOD-BY; I AM SORRY
MISS MARIANNE WAS NOT HERE.  REMEMBER ME KINDLY TO HER.
LA! IF YOU HAVE NOT GOT YOUR SPOTTED MUSLIN ON!--I WONDER
YOU WAS NOT AFRAID OF ITS BEING TORN."

SUCH WAS HER PARTING CONCERN; FOR AFTER THIS, SHE HAD
TIME ONLY TO PAY HER FAREWELL COMPLIMENTS TO MRS. JENNINGS,
BEFORE HER COMPANY WAS CLAIMED BY MRS. RICHARDSON;
AND ELINOR WAS LEFT IN POSSESSION OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH
MIGHT FEED HER POWERS OF REFLECTION SOME TIME, THOUGH SHE
HAD LEARNT VERY LITTLE MORE THAN WHAT HAD BEEN ALREADY
FORESEEN AND FOREPLANNED IN HER OWN MIND.  EDWARD'S MARRIAGE
WITH LUCY WAS AS FIRMLY DETERMINED ON, AND THE TIME
OF ITS TAKING PLACE REMAINED AS ABSOLUTELY UNCERTAIN,
AS SHE HAD CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE;--EVERY THING DEPENDED,
EXACTLY AFTER HER EXPECTATION, ON HIS GETTING THAT PREFERMENT,
OF WHICH, AT PRESENT, THERE SEEMED NOT THE SMALLEST CHANCE.

AS SOON AS THEY RETURNED TO THE CARRIAGE,
MRS. JENNINGS WAS EAGER FOR INFORMATION; BUT AS ELINOR
WISHED TO SPREAD AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
THAT HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE BEEN SO UNFAIRLY OBTAINED,
SHE CONFINED HERSELF TO THE BRIEF REPETITION OF SUCH
SIMPLE PARTICULARS, AS SHE FELT ASSURED THAT LUCY,
FOR THE SAKE OF HER OWN CONSEQUENCE, WOULD CHOOSE
TO HAVE KNOWN.  THE CONTINUANCE OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT,
AND THE MEANS THAT WERE ABLE TO BE TAKEN FOR PROMOTING
ITS END, WAS ALL HER COMMUNICATION; AND THIS PRODUCED
FROM MRS. JENNINGS THE FOLLOWING NATURAL REMARK.

"WAIT FOR HIS HAVING A LIVING!--AY, WE ALL KNOW HOW
THAT WILL END:--THEY WILL WAIT A TWELVEMONTH, AND FINDING
NO GOOD COMES OF IT, WILL SET DOWN UPON A CURACY OF FIFTY
POUNDS A-YEAR, WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS TWO THOUSAND POUNDS,
AND WHAT LITTLE MATTER MR. STEELE AND MR. PRATT CAN
GIVE HER.--THEN THEY WILL HAVE A CHILD EVERY YEAR! AND
LORD HELP 'EM! HOW POOR THEY WILL BE!--I MUST SEE
WHAT I CAN GIVE THEM TOWARDS FURNISHING THEIR HOUSE.
TWO MAIDS AND TWO MEN, INDEED!--AS I TALKED OF T'OTHER
DAY.--NO, NO, THEY MUST GET A STOUT GIRL OF ALL WORKS.--
BETTY'S SISTER WOULD NEVER DO FOR THEM NOW."

THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT ELINOR A LETTER BY THE
TWO-PENNY POST FROM LUCY HERSELF.  IT WAS AS FOLLOWS:

                    "BARTLETT'S BUILDING, MARCH.

     "I HOPE MY DEAR MISS DASHWOOD WILL EXCUSE THE
     LIBERTY I TAKE OF WRITING TO HER; BUT I KNOW YOUR
     FRIENDSHIP FOR ME WILL MAKE YOU PLEASED TO HEAR SUCH
     A GOOD ACCOUNT OF MYSELF AND MY DEAR EDWARD, AFTER
     ALL THE TROUBLES WE HAVE WENT THROUGH LATELY,
     THEREFORE WILL MAKE NO MORE APOLOGIES, BUT PROCEED
     TO SAY THAT, THANK GOD! THOUGH WE HAVE SUFFERED
     DREADFULLY, WE ARE BOTH QUITE WELL NOW, AND AS HAPPY
     AS WE MUST ALWAYS BE IN ONE ANOTHER'S LOVE.  WE HAVE
     HAD GREAT TRIALS, AND GREAT PERSECUTIONS, BUT
     HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE
     MANY FRIENDS, YOURSELF NOT THE LEAST AMONG THEM,
     WHOSE GREAT KINDNESS I SHALL ALWAYS THANKFULLY
     REMEMBER, AS WILL EDWARD TOO, WHO I HAVE TOLD OF
     IT.  I AM SURE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR, AS LIKEWISE
     DEAR MRS. JENNINGS, I SPENT TWO HAPPY HOURS WITH
     HIM YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, HE WOULD NOT HEAR OF OUR
     PARTING, THOUGH EARNESTLY DID I, AS I THOUGHT MY
     DUTY REQUIRED, URGE HIM TO IT FOR PRUDENCE SAKE,
     AND WOULD HAVE PARTED FOR EVER ON THE SPOT, WOULD
     HE CONSENT TO IT; BUT HE SAID IT SHOULD NEVER BE,
     HE DID NOT REGARD HIS MOTHER'S ANGER, WHILE HE COULD
     HAVE MY AFFECTIONS; OUR PROSPECTS ARE NOT VERY
     BRIGHT, TO BE SURE, BUT WE MUST WAIT, AND HOPE FOR
     THE BEST; HE WILL BE ORDAINED SHORTLY; AND SHOULD
     IT EVER BE IN YOUR POWER TO RECOMMEND HIM TO ANY
     BODY THAT HAS A LIVING TO BESTOW, AM VERY SURE YOU
     WILL NOT FORGET US, AND DEAR MRS. JENNINGS TOO,
     TRUST SHE WILL SPEAK A GOOD WORD FOR US TO SIR JOHN,
     OR MR. PALMER, OR ANY FRIEND THAT MAY BE ABLE TO
     ASSIST US.--POOR ANNE WAS MUCH TO BLAME FOR WHAT
     SHE DID, BUT SHE DID IT FOR THE BEST, SO I SAY
     NOTHING; HOPE MRS. JENNINGS WON'T THINK IT TOO MUCH
     TROUBLE TO GIVE US A CALL, SHOULD SHE COME THIS WAY
     ANY MORNING, 'TWOULD BE A GREAT KINDNESS, AND MY
     COUSINS WOULD BE PROUD TO KNOW HER.--MY PAPER REMINDS
     ME TO CONCLUDE; AND BEGGING TO BE MOST GRATEFULLY
     AND RESPECTFULLY REMEMBERED TO HER, AND TO SIR JOHN,
     AND LADY MIDDLETON, AND THE DEAR CHILDREN, WHEN YOU
     CHANCE TO SEE THEM, AND LOVE TO MISS MARIANNE,

                                      "I AM, &C."

AS SOON AS ELINOR HAD FINISHED IT, SHE PERFORMED
WHAT SHE CONCLUDED TO BE ITS WRITER'S REAL DESIGN,
BY PLACING IT IN THE HANDS OF MRS. JENNINGS, WHO READ IT
ALOUD WITH MANY COMMENTS OF SATISFACTION AND PRAISE.

"VERY WELL INDEED!--HOW PRETTILY SHE WRITES!--AYE,
THAT WAS QUITE PROPER TO LET HIM BE OFF IF HE WOULD.
THAT WAS JUST LIKE LUCY.--POOR SOUL! I WISH I COULD GET
HIM A LIVING, WITH ALL MY HEART.--SHE CALLS ME DEAR
MRS. JENNINGS, YOU SEE.  SHE IS A GOOD-HEARTED GIRL
AS EVER LIVED.--VERY WELL UPON MY WORD.  THAT SENTENCE
IS VERY PRETTILY TURNED.  YES, YES, I WILL GO AND SEE HER,
SURE ENOUGH.  HOW ATTENTIVE SHE IS, TO THINK OF EVERY
BODY!--THANK YOU, MY DEAR, FOR SHEWING IT ME.  IT IS
AS PRETTY A LETTER AS EVER I SAW, AND DOES LUCY'S HEAD
AND HEART GREAT CREDIT."



CHAPTER 39


THE MISS DASHWOODS HAD NOW BEEN RATHER MORE THAN
TWO MONTHS IN TOWN, AND MARIANNE'S IMPATIENCE TO BE GONE
INCREASED EVERY DAY.  SHE SIGHED FOR THE AIR, THE LIBERTY,
THE QUIET OF THE COUNTRY; AND FANCIED THAT IF ANY PLACE
COULD GIVE HER EASE, BARTON MUST DO IT.  ELINOR WAS HARDLY
LESS ANXIOUS THAN HERSELF FOR THEIR REMOVAL, AND ONLY SO MUCH
LESS BENT ON ITS BEING EFFECTED IMMEDIATELY, AS THAT SHE
WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF SO LONG A JOURNEY,
WHICH MARIANNE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGE.
SHE BEGAN, HOWEVER, SERIOUSLY TO TURN HER THOUGHTS TOWARDS
ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT, AND HAD ALREADY MENTIONED THEIR WISHES
TO THEIR KIND HOSTESS, WHO RESISTED THEM WITH ALL THE
ELOQUENCE OF HER GOOD-WILL, WHEN A PLAN WAS SUGGESTED,
WHICH, THOUGH DETAINING THEM FROM HOME YET A FEW WEEKS
LONGER, APPEARED TO ELINOR ALTOGETHER MUCH MORE ELIGIBLE
THAN ANY OTHER. THE PALMERS WERE TO REMOVE TO CLEVELAND
ABOUT THE END OF MARCH, FOR THE EASTER HOLIDAYS;
AND MRS. JENNINGS, WITH BOTH HER FRIENDS, RECEIVED A VERY
WARM INVITATION FROM CHARLOTTE TO GO WITH THEM.  THIS WOULD
NOT, IN ITSELF, HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT FOR THE DELICACY OF
MISS DASHWOOD;--BUT IT WAS INFORCED WITH SO MUCH REAL
POLITENESS BY MR. PALMER HIMSELF, AS, JOINED TO THE VERY
GREAT AMENDMENT OF HIS MANNERS TOWARDS THEM SINCE HER
SISTER HAD BEEN KNOWN TO BE UNHAPPY, INDUCED HER TO ACCEPT
IT WITH PLEASURE.

WHEN SHE TOLD MARIANNE WHAT SHE HAD DONE, HOWEVER,
HER FIRST REPLY WAS NOT VERY AUSPICIOUS.

"CLEVELAND!"--SHE CRIED, WITH GREAT AGITATION.
"NO, I CANNOT GO TO CLEVELAND."--

"YOU FORGET," SAID ELINOR GENTLY, "THAT ITS SITUATION
IS NOT...THAT IT IS NOT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF..."

"BUT IT IS IN SOMERSETSHIRE.--I CANNOT GO
INTO SOMERSETSHIRE.--THERE, WHERE I LOOKED FORWARD
TO GOING...NO, ELINOR, YOU CANNOT EXPECT ME TO GO THERE."

ELINOR WOULD NOT ARGUE UPON THE PROPRIETY OF OVERCOMING
SUCH FEELINGS;--SHE ONLY ENDEAVOURED TO COUNTERACT THEM BY
WORKING ON OTHERS;--REPRESENTED IT, THEREFORE, AS A MEASURE
WHICH WOULD FIX THE TIME OF HER RETURNING TO THAT DEAR MOTHER,
WHOM SHE SO MUCH WISHED TO SEE, IN A MORE ELIGIBLE,
MORE COMFORTABLE MANNER, THAN ANY OTHER PLAN COULD DO,
AND PERHAPS WITHOUT ANY GREATER DELAY.  FROM CLEVELAND,
WHICH WAS WITHIN A FEW MILES OF BRISTOL, THE DISTANCE TO
BARTON WAS NOT BEYOND ONE DAY, THOUGH A LONG DAY'S JOURNEY;
AND THEIR MOTHER'S SERVANT MIGHT EASILY COME THERE TO ATTEND
THEM DOWN; AND AS THERE COULD BE NO OCCASION OF THEIR
STAYING ABOVE A WEEK AT CLEVELAND, THEY MIGHT NOW BE AT
HOME IN LITTLE MORE THAN THREE WEEKS' TIME.  AS MARIANNE'S
AFFECTION FOR HER MOTHER WAS SINCERE, IT MUST TRIUMPH
WITH LITTLE DIFFICULTY, OVER THE IMAGINARY EVILS SHE HAD STARTED.

MRS. JENNINGS WAS SO FAR FROM BEING WEARY OF HER GUEST,
THAT SHE PRESSED THEM VERY EARNESTLY TO RETURN WITH HER AGAIN
FROM CLEVELAND.  ELINOR WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE ATTENTION,
BUT IT COULD NOT ALTER HER DESIGN; AND THEIR MOTHER'S
CONCURRENCE BEING READILY GAINED, EVERY THING RELATIVE
TO THEIR RETURN WAS ARRANGED AS FAR AS IT COULD BE;--
AND MARIANNE FOUND SOME RELIEF IN DRAWING UP A STATEMENT
OF THE HOURS THAT WERE YET TO DIVIDE HER FROM BARTON.

"AH! COLONEL, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU AND I SHALL
DO WITHOUT THE MISS DASHWOODS;"--WAS MRS. JENNINGS'S
ADDRESS TO HIM WHEN HE FIRST CALLED ON HER, AFTER THEIR
LEAVING HER WAS SETTLED--"FOR THEY ARE QUITE RESOLVED
UPON GOING HOME FROM THE PALMERS;--AND HOW FORLORN WE
SHALL BE, WHEN I COME BACK!--LORD! WE SHALL SIT AND GAPE
AT ONE ANOTHER AS DULL AS TWO CATS."

PERHAPS MRS. JENNINGS WAS IN HOPES, BY THIS VIGOROUS
SKETCH OF THEIR FUTURE ENNUI, TO PROVOKE HIM TO MAKE
THAT OFFER, WHICH MIGHT GIVE HIMSELF AN ESCAPE FROM IT;--
AND IF SO, SHE HAD SOON AFTERWARDS GOOD REASON TO THINK
HER OBJECT GAINED; FOR, ON ELINOR'S MOVING TO THE WINDOW
TO TAKE MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY THE DIMENSIONS OF A PRINT,
WHICH SHE WAS GOING TO COPY FOR HER FRIEND, HE FOLLOWED
HER TO IT WITH A LOOK OF PARTICULAR MEANING, AND CONVERSED
WITH HER THERE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  THE EFFECT OF HIS
DISCOURSE ON THE LADY TOO, COULD NOT ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION,
FOR THOUGH SHE WAS TOO HONORABLE TO LISTEN, AND HAD EVEN
CHANGED HER SEAT, ON PURPOSE THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HEAR,
TO ONE CLOSE BY THE PIANO FORTE ON WHICH MARIANNE
WAS PLAYING, SHE COULD NOT KEEP HERSELF FROM SEEING
THAT ELINOR CHANGED COLOUR, ATTENDED WITH AGITATION,
AND WAS TOO INTENT ON WHAT HE SAID TO PURSUE HER EMPLOYMENT.--
STILL FARTHER IN CONFIRMATION OF HER HOPES, IN THE INTERVAL
OF MARIANNE'S TURNING FROM ONE LESSON TO ANOTHER,
SOME WORDS OF THE COLONEL'S INEVITABLY REACHED HER EAR,
IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO BE APOLOGISING FOR THE BADNESS
OF HIS HOUSE.  THIS SET THE MATTER BEYOND A DOUBT.
SHE WONDERED, INDEED, AT HIS THINKING IT NECESSARY
TO DO SO; BUT SUPPOSED IT TO BE THE PROPER ETIQUETTE.
WHAT ELINOR SAID IN REPLY SHE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH,
BUT JUDGED FROM THE MOTION OF HER LIPS, THAT SHE DID
NOT THINK THAT ANY MATERIAL OBJECTION;--AND MRS. JENNINGS
COMMENDED HER IN HER HEART FOR BEING SO HONEST.
THEY THEN TALKED ON FOR A FEW MINUTES LONGER WITHOUT HER
CATCHING A SYLLABLE, WHEN ANOTHER LUCKY STOP IN MARIANNE'S
PERFORMANCE BROUGHT HER THESE WORDS IN THE COLONEL'S CALM VOICE,--

"I AM AFRAID IT CANNOT TAKE PLACE VERY SOON."

ASTONISHED AND SHOCKED AT SO UNLOVER-LIKE A SPEECH,
SHE WAS ALMOST READY TO CRY OUT, "LORD! WHAT SHOULD
HINDER IT?"--BUT CHECKING HER DESIRE, CONFINED HERSELF
TO THIS SILENT EJACULATION.

"THIS IS VERY STRANGE!--SURE HE NEED NOT WAIT TO BE OLDER."

THIS DELAY ON THE COLONEL'S SIDE, HOWEVER, DID NOT
SEEM TO OFFEND OR MORTIFY HIS FAIR COMPANION IN THE LEAST,
FOR ON THEIR BREAKING UP THE CONFERENCE SOON AFTERWARDS,
AND MOVING DIFFERENT WAYS, MRS. JENNINGS VERY PLAINLY HEARD
ELINOR SAY, AND WITH A VOICE WHICH SHEWED HER TO FEEL WHAT SHE SAID,

"I SHALL ALWAYS THINK MYSELF VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU."

MRS. JENNINGS WAS DELIGHTED WITH HER GRATITUDE,
AND ONLY WONDERED THAT AFTER HEARING SUCH A SENTENCE,
THE COLONEL SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF THEM, AS HE
IMMEDIATELY DID, WITH THE UTMOST SANG-FROID, AND GO AWAY
WITHOUT MAKING HER ANY REPLY!--SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT HER OLD
FRIEND COULD HAVE MADE SO INDIFFERENT A SUITOR.

WHAT HAD REALLY PASSED BETWEEN THEM WAS TO THIS EFFECT.

"I HAVE HEARD," SAID HE, WITH GREAT COMPASSION,
"OF THE INJUSTICE YOUR FRIEND MR. FERRARS HAS SUFFERED
FROM HIS FAMILY; FOR IF I UNDERSTAND THE MATTER RIGHT,
HE HAS BEEN ENTIRELY CAST OFF BY THEM FOR PERSEVERING
IN HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH A VERY DESERVING YOUNG WOMAN.--
HAVE I BEEN RIGHTLY INFORMED?--IS IT SO?--"

ELINOR TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS.

"THE CRUELTY, THE IMPOLITIC CRUELTY,"--HE REPLIED,
WITH GREAT FEELING,--"OF DIVIDING, OR ATTEMPTING TO DIVIDE,
TWO YOUNG PEOPLE LONG ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER, IS TERRIBLE.--
MRS. FERRARS DOES NOT KNOW WHAT SHE MAY BE DOING--WHAT
SHE MAY DRIVE HER SON TO.  I HAVE SEEN MR. FERRARS TWO
OR THREE TIMES IN HARLEY STREET, AND AM MUCH PLEASED
WITH HIM.  HE IS NOT A YOUNG MAN WITH WHOM ONE CAN
BE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED IN A SHORT TIME, BUT I HAVE
SEEN ENOUGH OF HIM TO WISH HIM WELL FOR HIS OWN SAKE,
AND AS A FRIEND OF YOURS, I WISH IT STILL MORE.
I UNDERSTAND THAT HE INTENDS TO TAKE ORDERS.  WILL YOU
BE SO GOOD AS TO TELL HIM THAT THE LIVING OF DELAFORD,
NOW JUST VACANT, AS I AM INFORMED BY THIS DAY'S POST,
IS HIS, IF HE THINK IT WORTH HIS ACCEPTANCE--BUT THAT,
PERHAPS, SO UNFORTUNATELY CIRCUMSTANCED AS HE IS NOW,
IT MAY BE  NONSENSE TO APPEAR TO DOUBT; I ONLY WISH IT
WERE MORE  VALUABLE.-- IT IS A RECTORY, BUT A SMALL ONE;
THE LATE INCUMBENT, I BELIEVE, DID NOT MAKE MORE THAN
200 L PER ANNUM, AND THOUGH IT IS CERTAINLY CAPABLE
OF IMPROVEMENT, I FEAR, NOT TO SUCH AN AMOUNT AS
TO AFFORD HIM A VERY COMFORTABLE INCOME.  SUCH AS IT IS,
HOWEVER, MY PLEASURE IN PRESENTING HIM TO IT,
WILL BE VERY GREAT.  PRAY ASSURE HIM OF IT."

ELINOR'S ASTONISHMENT AT THIS COMMISSION COULD
HARDLY HAVE BEEN GREATER, HAD THE COLONEL BEEN REALLY
MAKING HER AN OFFER OF HIS HAND.  THE PREFERMENT,
WHICH ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE HAD CONSIDERED AS HOPELESS
FOR EDWARD, WAS ALREADY PROVIDED TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY;--
AND SHE, OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, WAS FIXED ON TO
BESTOW IT!--HER EMOTION WAS SUCH AS MRS. JENNINGS HAD
ATTRIBUTED TO A VERY DIFFERENT CAUSE;--BUT WHATEVER MINOR
FEELINGS LESS PURE, LESS PLEASING, MIGHT HAVE A SHARE
IN THAT EMOTION, HER ESTEEM FOR THE GENERAL BENEVOLENCE,
AND HER GRATITUDE FOR THE PARTICULAR FRIENDSHIP,
WHICH TOGETHER PROMPTED COLONEL BRANDON TO THIS ACT,
WERE STRONGLY FELT, AND WARMLY EXPRESSED.  SHE THANKED HIM
FOR IT WITH ALL HER HEART, SPOKE OF EDWARD'S PRINCIPLES AND
DISPOSITION WITH THAT PRAISE WHICH SHE KNEW THEM TO DESERVE;
AND PROMISED TO UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION WITH PLEASURE,
IF IT WERE REALLY HIS WISH TO PUT OFF SO AGREEABLE AN OFFICE
TO ANOTHER.  BUT AT THE SAME TIME, SHE COULD NOT HELP
THINKING THAT NO ONE COULD SO WELL PERFORM IT AS HIMSELF.
IT WAS AN OFFICE IN SHORT, FROM WHICH, UNWILLING TO GIVE
EDWARD THE PAIN OF RECEIVING AN OBLIGATION FROM HER,
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO BE SPARED HERSELF;--
BUT COLONEL BRANDON, ON MOTIVES OF EQUAL DELICACY,
DECLINING IT LIKEWISE, STILL SEEMED SO DESIROUS OF ITS BEING
GIVEN THROUGH HER MEANS, THAT SHE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT
MAKE FARTHER OPPOSITION.  EDWARD, SHE BELIEVED, WAS STILL IN
TOWN,
AND FORTUNATELY SHE HAD HEARD HIS ADDRESS FROM MISS STEELE.
SHE COULD UNDERTAKE THEREFORE TO INFORM HIM OF IT,
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY.  AFTER THIS HAD BEEN SETTLED,
COLONEL BRANDON BEGAN TO TALK OF HIS OWN ADVANTAGE
IN SECURING SO RESPECTABLE AND AGREEABLE A NEIGHBOUR,
AND THEN IT WAS THAT HE MENTIONED WITH REGRET, THAT THE
HOUSE WAS SMALL AND INDIFFERENT;--AN EVIL WHICH ELINOR,
AS MRS. JENNINGS HAD SUPPOSED HER TO DO, MADE VERY LIGHT OF,
AT LEAST AS FAR AS REGARDED ITS SIZE.

"THE SMALLNESS OF THE HOUSE," SAID SHE,
"I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY INCONVENIENCE TO THEM,
FOR IT WILL BE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR FAMILY AND INCOME."

BY WHICH THE COLONEL WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT SHE
WAS CONSIDERING MR. FERRARS'S MARRIAGE AS THE CERTAIN
CONSEQUENCE OF THE PRESENTATION; FOR HE DID NOT SUPPOSE IT
POSSIBLE THAT DELAFORD LIVING COULD SUPPLY SUCH AN INCOME,
AS ANYBODY IN HIS STYLE OF LIFE WOULD VENTURE TO SETTLE ON--
AND HE SAID SO.

"THIS LITTLE RECTORY CAN DO NO MORE THAN MAKE MR. FERRARS
COMFORTABLE AS A BACHELOR; IT CANNOT ENABLE HIM TO MARRY.
I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT MY PATRONAGE ENDS WITH THIS;
AND MY INTEREST IS HARDLY MORE EXTENSIVE.  IF, HOWEVER,
BY AN UNFORESEEN CHANCE IT SHOULD BE IN MY POWER TO SERVE
HIM FARTHER, I MUST THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY OF HIM
FROM WHAT I NOW DO, IF I AM NOT AS READY TO BE USEFUL
TO HIM THEN AS I SINCERELY WISH I COULD BE AT PRESENT.
WHAT I AM NOW DOING INDEED, SEEMS NOTHING AT ALL,
SINCE IT CAN ADVANCE HIM SO LITTLE TOWARDS WHAT MUST
BE HIS PRINCIPAL, HIS ONLY OBJECT OF HAPPINESS.
HIS MARRIAGE MUST STILL BE A DISTANT GOOD;--AT LEAST,
I AM AFRAID IT CANNOT TAKE PLACE VERY SOON.--"

SUCH WAS THE SENTENCE WHICH, WHEN MISUNDERSTOOD,
SO JUSTLY OFFENDED THE DELICATE FEELINGS OF MRS. JENNINGS;
BUT AFTER THIS NARRATION OF WHAT REALLY PASSED BETWEEN
COLONEL BRANDON AND ELINOR, WHILE THEY STOOD AT THE WINDOW,
THE GRATITUDE EXPRESSED BY THE LATTER ON THEIR PARTING, MAY
PERHAPS APPEAR IN GENERAL, NOT LESS REASONABLY EXCITED,
NOR LESS PROPERLY WORDED THAN IF IT HAD ARISEN FROM
AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE.



CHAPTER 40


"WELL, MISS DASHWOOD," SAID MRS. JENNINGS,
SAGACIOUSLY SMILING, AS SOON AS THE GENTLEMAN HAD WITHDRAWN,
"I DO NOT ASK YOU WHAT THE COLONEL HAS BEEN SAYING TO YOU;
FOR THOUGH, UPON MY HONOUR, I TRIED TO KEEP OUT OF HEARING,
I COULD NOT HELP CATCHING ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND HIS BUSINESS.
AND I ASSURE YOU I NEVER WAS BETTER PLEASED IN MY LIFE,
AND I WISH YOU JOY OF IT WITH ALL MY HEART."

"THANK YOU, MA'AM," SAID ELINOR.  "IT IS A MATTER
OF GREAT JOY TO ME; AND I FEEL THE GOODNESS OF COLONEL
BRANDON MOST SENSIBLY.  THERE ARE NOT MANY MEN WHO WOULD
ACT AS HE HAS DONE.  FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE SO COMPASSIONATE
A HEART!  I NEVER WAS MORE ASTONISHED IN MY LIFE."

"LORD! MY DEAR, YOU ARE VERY MODEST.  I AN'T THE LEAST
ASTONISHED AT IT IN THE WORLD, FOR I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT
OF LATE, THERE WAS NOTHING MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN."

"YOU JUDGED FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE COLONEL'S
GENERAL BENEVOLENCE; BUT AT LEAST YOU COULD NOT FORESEE
THAT THE OPPORTUNITY WOULD SO VERY SOON OCCUR."

"OPPORTUNITY!" REPEATED MRS. JENNINGS--"OH! AS TO THAT,
WHEN A MAN HAS ONCE MADE UP HIS MIND TO SUCH A THING,
SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE WILL SOON FIND AN OPPORTUNITY.
WELL, MY DEAR, I WISH YOU JOY OF IT AGAIN AND AGAIN;
AND IF EVER THERE WAS A HAPPY COUPLE IN THE WORLD, I THINK
I SHALL SOON KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THEM."

"YOU MEAN TO GO TO DELAFORD AFTER THEM I SUPPOSE,"
SAID ELINOR, WITH A FAINT SMILE.

"AYE, MY DEAR, THAT I DO, INDEED.  AND AS TO THE HOUSE
BEING A BAD ONE, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE COLONEL WOULD BE AT,
FOR IT IS AS GOOD A ONE AS EVER I SAW."

"HE SPOKE OF ITS BEING OUT OF REPAIR."

"WELL, AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT? WHY DON'T HE REPAIR IT?--
WHO SHOULD DO IT BUT HIMSELF?"

THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE SERVANT'S COMING IN TO
ANNOUNCE THE CARRIAGE BEING AT THE DOOR; AND MRS. JENNINGS
IMMEDIATELY PREPARING TO GO, SAID,--

"WELL, MY DEAR, I MUST BE GONE BEFORE I HAVE HAD HALF
MY TALK OUT.  BUT, HOWEVER, WE MAY HAVE IT ALL OVER IN
THE EVENING; FOR WE SHALL BE QUITE ALONE.  I DO NOT ASK
YOU TO GO WITH ME, FOR I DARE SAY YOUR MIND IS TOO FULL
OF THE MATTER TO CARE FOR COMPANY; AND BESIDES, YOU MUST
LONG TO TELL YOUR SISTER ALL ABOUT IT."

MARIANNE HAD LEFT THE ROOM BEFORE THE CONVERSATION BEGAN.

"CERTAINLY, MA'AM, I SHALL TELL MARIANNE OF IT;
BUT I SHALL NOT MENTION IT AT PRESENT TO ANY BODY ELSE."

"OH! VERY WELL," SAID MRS. JENNINGS RATHER DISAPPOINTED.
"THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ME TELL IT TO LUCY, FOR I THINK
OF GOING AS FAR AS HOLBORN TO-DAY."

"NO, MA'AM, NOT EVEN LUCY IF YOU PLEASE.
ONE DAY'S DELAY WILL NOT BE VERY MATERIAL; AND TILL I
HAVE WRITTEN TO MR. FERRARS, I THINK IT OUGHT NOT TO BE
MENTIONED TO ANY BODY ELSE.  I SHALL DO THAT DIRECTLY.
IT IS OF IMPORTANCE THAT NO TIME SHOULD BE LOST WITH HIM,
FOR HE WILL OF COURSE HAVE MUCH TO DO RELATIVE TO
HIS ORDINATION."

THIS SPEECH AT FIRST PUZZLED MRS. JENNINGS EXCEEDINGLY.
WHY MR. FERRARS WAS TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN TO ABOUT IT
IN SUCH A HURRY, SHE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY COMPREHEND.
A FEW MOMENTS' REFLECTION, HOWEVER, PRODUCED A VERY HAPPY IDEA,
AND SHE EXCLAIMED;--

"OH, HO!--I UNDERSTAND YOU.  MR. FERRARS IS TO BE
THE MAN.  WELL, SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR HIM.  AY, TO BE SURE,
HE MUST BE ORDAINED IN READINESS; AND I AM VERY GLAD
TO FIND THINGS ARE SO FORWARD BETWEEN YOU.  BUT, MY DEAR,
IS NOT THIS RATHER OUT OF CHARACTER?  SHOULD NOT THE COLONEL
WRITE HIMSELF?--SURE, HE IS THE PROPER PERSON."

ELINOR DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND THE BEGINNING OF
MRS. JENNINGS'S SPEECH, NEITHER DID SHE THINK IT WORTH
INQUIRING INTO; AND THEREFORE ONLY REPLIED TO ITS CONCLUSION.

"COLONEL BRANDON IS SO DELICATE A MAN, THAT HE RATHER
WISHED ANY ONE TO ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTIONS TO MR. FERRARS
THAN HIMSELF."

"AND SO YOU ARE FORCED TO DO IT.  WELL THAT IS AN ODD
KIND OF DELICACY!  HOWEVER, I WILL NOT DISTURB YOU (SEEING
HER PREPARING TO WRITE.)  YOU KNOW YOUR OWN CONCERNS BEST.
SO GOODBY, MY DEAR.  I HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY THING TO
PLEASE ME SO WELL SINCE CHARLOTTE WAS BROUGHT TO BED."

AND AWAY SHE WENT; BUT RETURNING AGAIN IN A MOMENT,

"I HAVE JUST BEEN THINKING OF BETTY'S SISTER, MY DEAR.
I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO GET HER SO GOOD A MISTRESS.
BUT WHETHER SHE WOULD DO FOR A LADY'S MAID, I AM SURE I
CAN'T TELL.  SHE IS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEMAID, AND WORKS
VERY WELL AT HER NEEDLE.  HOWEVER, YOU WILL THINK OF ALL
THAT AT YOUR LEISURE."

"CERTAINLY, MA'AM," REPLIED ELINOR, NOT HEARING
MUCH OF WHAT SHE SAID, AND MORE ANXIOUS TO BE ALONE,
THAN TO BE MISTRESS OF THE SUBJECT.

HOW SHE SHOULD BEGIN--HOW SHE SHOULD EXPRESS
HERSELF IN HER NOTE TO EDWARD, WAS NOW ALL HER CONCERN.
THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES BETWEEN THEM MADE
A DIFFICULTY OF THAT WHICH TO ANY OTHER PERSON WOULD
HAVE BEEN THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD; BUT SHE
EQUALLY FEARED TO SAY TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE, AND SAT
DELIBERATING OVER HER PAPER, WITH THE PEN IN HER BAND,
TILL BROKEN IN ON BY THE ENTRANCE OF EDWARD HIMSELF.

HE HAD MET MRS. JENNINGS AT THE DOOR IN HER WAY TO
THE CARRIAGE, AS HE CAME TO LEAVE HIS FAREWELL CARD; AND SHE,
AFTER APOLOGISING FOR NOT RETURNING HERSELF, HAD OBLIGED
HIM TO ENTER, BY SAYING THAT MISS DASHWOOD WAS ABOVE,
AND WANTED TO SPEAK WITH HIM ON VERY PARTICULAR BUSINESS.

ELINOR HAD JUST BEEN CONGRATULATING HERSELF,
IN THE MIDST OF HER PERPLEXITY, THAT HOWEVER DIFFICULT IT
MIGHT BE TO EXPRESS HERSELF PROPERLY BY LETTER, IT WAS
AT LEAST PREFERABLE TO GIVING THE INFORMATION BY WORD
OF MOUTH, WHEN HER VISITOR ENTERED, TO FORCE HER UPON THIS
GREATEST EXERTION OF ALL.  HER ASTONISHMENT AND CONFUSION
WERE VERY GREAT ON HIS SO SUDDEN APPEARANCE.  SHE HAD
NOT SEEN HIM BEFORE SINCE HIS ENGAGEMENT BECAME PUBLIC,
AND THEREFORE NOT SINCE HIS KNOWING HER TO BE ACQUAINTED
WITH IT; WHICH, WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHAT SHE
HAD BEEN THINKING OF, AND WHAT SHE HAD TO TELL HIM,
MADE HER FEEL PARTICULARLY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR SOME MINUTES.
HE TOO WAS MUCH DISTRESSED; AND THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER
IN A MOST PROMISING STATE OF EMBARRASSMENT.--WHETHER HE
HAD ASKED HER PARDON FOR HIS INTRUSION ON FIRST COMING
INTO THE ROOM, HE COULD NOT RECOLLECT; BUT DETERMINING
TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE, HE MADE HIS APOLOGY IN FORM
AS SOON AS HE COULD SAY ANY THING, AFTER TAKING A CHAIR.

"MRS. JENNINGS TOLD ME," SAID HE, "THAT YOU WISHED
TO SPEAK WITH ME, AT LEAST I UNDERSTOOD HER SO--OR I
CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT HAVE INTRUDED ON YOU IN SUCH A MANNER;
THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY
SORRY TO LEAVE LONDON WITHOUT SEEING YOU AND YOUR SISTER;
ESPECIALLY AS IT WILL MOST LIKELY BE SOME TIME--IT
IS NOT PROBABLE THAT I SHOULD SOON HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF MEETING YOU AGAIN.  I GO TO OXFORD TOMORROW."

"YOU WOULD NOT HAVE GONE, HOWEVER," SAID ELINOR,
RECOVERING HERSELF, AND DETERMINED TO GET OVER WHAT SHE
SO MUCH DREADED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, "WITHOUT RECEIVING
OUR GOOD WISHES, EVEN IF WE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GIVE THEM
IN PERSON.  MRS. JENNINGS WAS QUITE RIGHT IN WHAT SHE SAID.
I HAVE SOMETHING OF CONSEQUENCE TO INFORM YOU OF,
WHICH I WAS ON THE POINT OF COMMUNICATING BY PAPER.
I AM CHARGED WITH A MOST AGREEABLE OFFICE (BREATHING
RATHER FASTER THAN USUAL AS SHE SPOKE.)  COLONEL BRANDON,
WHO WAS HERE ONLY TEN MINUTES AGO, HAS DESIRED ME TO SAY,
THAT UNDERSTANDING YOU MEAN TO TAKE ORDERS, HE HAS
GREAT PLEASURE IN OFFERING YOU THE LIVING OF DELAFORD
NOW JUST VACANT, AND ONLY WISHES IT WERE MORE VALUABLE.
ALLOW ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON HAVING SO RESPECTABLE
AND WELL-JUDGING A FRIEND, AND TO JOIN IN HIS WISH THAT
THE LIVING--IT IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED A-YEAR--WERE MUCH
MORE CONSIDERABLE, AND SUCH AS MIGHT BETTER ENABLE YOU
TO--AS MIGHT BE MORE THAN A TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION TO
YOURSELF--SUCH, IN SHORT, AS MIGHT ESTABLISH ALL YOUR VIEWS
OF HAPPINESS."

WHAT EDWARD FELT, AS HE COULD NOT SAY IT HIMSELF,
IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD SAY FOR HIM.
HE LOOKED ALL THE ASTONISHMENT WHICH SUCH UNEXPECTED,
SUCH UNTHOUGHT-OF INFORMATION COULD NOT FAIL OF EXCITING;
BUT HE SAID ONLY THESE TWO WORDS,

"COLONEL BRANDON!"

"YES," CONTINUED ELINOR, GATHERING MORE RESOLUTION,
AS SOME OF THE WORST WAS OVER, "COLONEL BRANDON MEANS
IT AS A TESTIMONY OF HIS CONCERN FOR WHAT HAS LATELY
PASSED--FOR THE CRUEL SITUATION IN WHICH THE UNJUSTIFIABLE
CONDUCT OF YOUR FAMILY HAS PLACED YOU--A CONCERN
WHICH I AM SURE MARIANNE, MYSELF, AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS,
MUST SHARE; AND LIKEWISE AS A PROOF OF HIS HIGH ESTEEM
FOR YOUR GENERAL CHARACTER, AND HIS PARTICULAR APPROBATION
OF YOUR BEHAVIOUR ON THE PRESENT OCCASION."

"COLONEL BRANDON GIVE ME A LIVING!--CAN IT BE POSSIBLE?"

"THE UNKINDNESS OF YOUR OWN RELATIONS HAS MADE YOU
ASTONISHED TO FIND FRIENDSHIP ANY WHERE."

"NO," REPLIED BE, WITH SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS, "NOT TO
FIND IT IN YOU; FOR I CANNOT BE IGNORANT THAT TO YOU,
TO YOUR GOODNESS, I OWE IT ALL.--I FEEL IT--I WOULD EXPRESS
IT IF I COULD--BUT, AS YOU WELL KNOW, I AM NO ORATOR."

"YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN.  I DO ASSURE YOU
THAT YOU OWE IT ENTIRELY, AT LEAST ALMOST ENTIRELY,
TO YOUR OWN MERIT, AND COLONEL BRANDON'S DISCERNMENT
OF IT.  I HAVE HAD NO HAND IN IT.  I DID NOT EVEN KNOW,
TILL I UNDERSTOOD HIS DESIGN, THAT THE LIVING WAS VACANT;
NOR HAD IT EVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT HE MIGHT HAVE
HAD SUCH A LIVING IN HIS GIFT.  AS A FRIEND OF MINE,
OF MY FAMILY, HE MAY, PERHAPS--INDEED I KNOW HE HAS,
STILL GREATER PLEASURE IN BESTOWING IT; BUT, UPON MY WORD,
YOU OWE NOTHING TO MY SOLICITATION."

TRUTH OBLIGED HER TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME SMALL SHARE
IN THE ACTION, BUT SHE WAS AT THE SAME TIME SO UNWILLING
TO APPEAR AS THE BENEFACTRESS OF EDWARD, THAT SHE ACKNOWLEDGED
IT WITH HESITATION; WHICH PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED TO FIX
THAT SUSPICION IN HIS MIND WHICH HAD RECENTLY ENTERED IT.
FOR A SHORT TIME HE SAT DEEP IN THOUGHT, AFTER ELINOR HAD CEASED
TO SPEAK;--AT LAST, AND AS IF IT WERE RATHER AN EFFORT, HE SAID,

"COLONEL BRANDON SEEMS A MAN OF GREAT WORTH AND RESPECTABILITY.
I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD HIM SPOKEN OF AS SUCH, AND YOUR BROTHER
I KNOW ESTEEMS HIM HIGHLY.  HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY A SENSIBLE MAN,
AND IN HIS MANNERS PERFECTLY THE GENTLEMAN."

"INDEED," REPLIED ELINOR, "I BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL FIND HIM,
ON FARTHER ACQUAINTANCE, ALL THAT YOU HAVE HEARD HIM TO BE,
AND AS YOU WILL BE SUCH VERY NEAR NEIGHBOURS (FOR I UNDERSTAND
THE PARSONAGE IS ALMOST CLOSE TO THE MANSION-HOUSE,)
IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT HE SHOULD BE ALL THIS."

EDWARD MADE NO ANSWER; BUT WHEN SHE HAD TURNED
AWAY HER HEAD, GAVE HER A LOOK SO SERIOUS, SO EARNEST,
SO UNCHEERFUL, AS SEEMED TO SAY, THAT HE MIGHT HEREAFTER WISH
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PARSONAGE AND THE MANSION-HOUSE
MUCH GREATER.

"COLONEL BRANDON, I THINK, LODGES IN ST. JAMES STREET,"
SAID HE, SOON AFTERWARDS, RISING FROM HIS CHAIR.

ELINOR TOLD HIM THE NUMBER OF THE HOUSE.

"I MUST HURRY AWAY THEN, TO GIVE HIM THOSE THANKS
WHICH YOU WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU; TO ASSURE HIM
THAT HE HAS MADE ME A VERY--AN EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY MAN."

ELINOR DID NOT OFFER TO DETAIN HIM; AND THEY PARTED,
WITH A VERY EARNEST ASSURANCE ON HER SIDE OF HER UNCEASING
GOOD WISHES FOR HIS HAPPINESS IN EVERY CHANGE OF SITUATION
THAT MIGHT BEFALL HIM; ON HIS, WITH RATHER AN ATTEMPT TO
RETURN THE SAME GOOD WILL, THAN THE POWER OF EXPRESSING IT.

"WHEN I SEE HIM AGAIN," SAID ELINOR TO HERSELF,
AS THE DOOR SHUT HIM OUT, "I SHALL SEE HIM THE HUSBAND
OF LUCY."

AND WITH THIS PLEASING ANTICIPATION, SHE SAT DOWN
TO RECONSIDER THE PAST, RECALL THE WORDS AND ENDEAVOUR
TO COMPREHEND ALL THE FEELINGS OF EDWARD; AND, OF COURSE,
TO REFLECT ON HER OWN WITH DISCONTENT.

WHEN MRS. JENNINGS CAME HOME, THOUGH SHE RETURNED
FROM SEEING PEOPLE WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE,
AND OF WHOM THEREFORE SHE MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY,
HER MIND WAS SO MUCH MORE OCCUPIED BY THE IMPORTANT SECRET
IN HER POSSESSION, THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE, THAT SHE
REVERTED TO IT AGAIN AS SOON AS ELINOR APPEARED.

"WELL, MY DEAR," SHE CRIED, "I SENT YOU UP TO THE
YOUNG MAN.  DID NOT I DO RIGHT?--AND I SUPPOSE YOU HAD
NO GREAT DIFFICULTY--YOU DID NOT FIND HIM VERY UNWILLING
TO ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSAL?"

"NO, MA'AM; THAT WAS NOT VERY LIKELY."

"WELL, AND HOW SOON WILL HE BE READY?--FOR IT SEEMS
ALL TO DEPEND UPON THAT."

"REALLY," SAID ELINOR, "I KNOW SO LITTLE OF THESE KIND
OF FORMS, THAT I CAN HARDLY EVEN CONJECTURE AS TO THE TIME,
OR THE PREPARATION NECESSARY; BUT I SUPPOSE TWO OR THREE
MONTHS WILL COMPLETE HIS ORDINATION."

"TWO OR THREE MONTHS!" CRIED MRS. JENNINGS; "LORD! MY DEAR,
HOW CALMLY YOU TALK OF IT; AND CAN THE COLONEL WAIT TWO
OR THREE MONTHS! LORD BLESS ME!--I AM SURE IT WOULD PUT ME
QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE!--AND THOUGH ONE WOULD BE VERY GLAD
TO DO A KINDNESS BY POOR MR. FERRARS, I DO THINK IT IS
NOT WORTH WHILE TO WAIT TWO OR THREE MONTHS FOR HIM.
SURE SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT BE FOUND THAT WOULD DO AS WELL;
SOMEBODY THAT IS IN ORDERS ALREADY."

"MY DEAR MA'AM," SAID ELINOR, "WHAT CAN YOU BE THINKING OF?--
WHY, COLONEL BRANDON'S ONLY OBJECT IS TO BE OF USE TO MR. FERRARS."

"LORD BLESS YOU, MY DEAR!--SURE YOU DO NOT MEAN TO PERSUADE
ME THAT THE COLONEL ONLY MARRIES YOU FOR THE SAKE OF GIVING
TEN GUINEAS TO MR. FERRARS!"

THE DECEPTION COULD NOT CONTINUE AFTER THIS;
AND AN EXPLANATION IMMEDIATELY TOOK PLACE, BY WHICH BOTH
GAINED CONSIDERABLE AMUSEMENT FOR THE MOMENT, WITHOUT ANY
MATERIAL LOSS OF HAPPINESS TO EITHER, FOR MRS. JENNINGS
ONLY EXCHANGED ONE FORM OF DELIGHT FOR ANOTHER, AND STILL
WITHOUT FORFEITING HER EXPECTATION OF THE FIRST.

"AYE, AYE, THE PARSONAGE IS BUT A SMALL ONE," SAID SHE,
AFTER THE FIRST EBULLITION OF SURPRISE AND SATISFACTION
WAS OVER, "AND VERY LIKELY MAY BE OUT OF REPAIR; BUT TO HEAR
A MAN APOLOGISING, AS I THOUGHT, FOR A HOUSE THAT TO MY
KNOWLEDGE HAS FIVE SITTING ROOMS ON THE GROUND-FLOOR, AND I
THINK THE HOUSEKEEPER TOLD ME COULD MAKE UP FIFTEEN BEDS!--
AND TO YOU TOO, THAT HAD BEEN USED TO LIVE IN BARTON COTTAGE!--
IT SEEMS QUITE RIDICULOUS.  BUT, MY DEAR, WE MUST
TOUCH UP THE COLONEL TO DO SOME THING TO THE PARSONAGE,
AND MAKE IT COMFORTABLE FOR THEM, BEFORE LUCY GOES TO IT."

"BUT COLONEL BRANDON DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY IDEA
OF THE LIVING'S BEING ENOUGH TO ALLOW THEM TO MARRY."

"THE COLONEL IS A NINNY, MY DEAR; BECAUSE HE HAS TWO
THOUSAND A-YEAR HIMSELF, HE THINKS THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN MARRY
ON LESS.  TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, THAT, IF I AM ALIVE, I SHALL
BE PAYING A VISIT AT DELAFORD PARSONAGE BEFORE MICHAELMAS;
AND I AM SURE I SHA'NT GO IF LUCY AN'T THERE."

ELINOR WAS QUITE OF HER OPINION, AS TO THE PROBABILITY
OF THEIR NOT WAITING FOR ANY THING MORE.



CHAPTER 41


EDWARD, HAVING CARRIED HIS THANKS TO COLONEL BRANDON,
PROCEEDED WITH HIS HAPPINESS TO LUCY; AND SUCH WAS THE
EXCESS OF IT BY THE TIME HE REACHED BARTLETT'S BUILDINGS,
THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO ASSURE MRS. JENNINGS, WHO CALLED
ON HER AGAIN THE NEXT DAY WITH HER CONGRATULATIONS,
THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM IN SUCH SPIRITS BEFORE
IN HER LIFE.

HER OWN HAPPINESS, AND HER OWN SPIRITS, WERE AT
LEAST VERY CERTAIN; AND SHE JOINED MRS. JENNINGS MOST
HEARTILY IN HER EXPECTATION OF THEIR BEING ALL COMFORTABLY
TOGETHER IN DELAFORD PARSONAGE BEFORE MICHAELMAS.
SO FAR WAS SHE, AT THE SAME TIME, FROM ANY BACKWARDNESS
TO GIVE ELINOR THAT CREDIT WHICH EDWARD WOULD GIVE HER,
THAT SHE SPOKE OF HER FRIENDSHIP FOR THEM BOTH WITH THE MOST
GRATEFUL WARMTH, WAS READY TO OWN ALL THEIR OBLIGATION
TO HER, AND OPENLY DECLARED THAT NO EXERTION FOR THEIR
GOOD ON MISS DASHWOOD'S PART, EITHER PRESENT OR FUTURE,
WOULD EVER SURPRISE HER, FOR SHE BELIEVED HER CAPABLE OF
DOING ANY THING IN THE WORLD FOR THOSE SHE REALLY VALUED.
AS FOR COLONEL BRANDON, SHE WAS NOT ONLY READY TO WORSHIP
HIM AS A SAINT, BUT WAS MOREOVER TRULY ANXIOUS THAT
HE SHOULD BE TREATED AS ONE IN ALL WORLDLY CONCERNS;
ANXIOUS THAT HIS TITHES SHOULD BE RAISED TO THE UTMOST;
AND SCARCELY RESOLVED TO AVAIL HERSELF, AT DELAFORD,
AS FAR AS SHE POSSIBLY COULD, OF HIS SERVANTS, HIS CARRIAGE,
HIS COWS, AND HIS POULTRY.

IT WAS NOW ABOVE A WEEK SINCE JOHN DASHWOOD HAD
CALLED IN BERKELEY STREET, AND AS SINCE THAT TIME NO NOTICE
HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THEM OF HIS WIFE'S INDISPOSITION,
BEYOND ONE VERBAL ENQUIRY, ELINOR BEGAN TO FEEL IT
NECESSARY TO PAY HER A VISIT.--THIS WAS AN OBLIGATION,
HOWEVER, WHICH NOT ONLY OPPOSED HER OWN INCLINATION,
BUT WHICH HAD NOT THE ASSISTANCE OF ANY ENCOURAGEMENT
FROM HER COMPANIONS.  MARIANNE, NOT CONTENTED WITH
ABSOLUTELY REFUSING TO GO HERSELF, WAS VERY URGENT
TO PREVENT HER SISTER'S GOING AT ALL; AND MRS. JENNINGS,
THOUGH HER CARRIAGE WAS ALWAYS AT ELINOR'S SERVICE,
SO VERY MUCH DISLIKED MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD, THAT NOT EVEN HER
CURIOSITY TO SEE HOW SHE LOOKED AFTER THE LATE DISCOVERY,
NOR HER STRONG DESIRE TO AFFRONT HER BY TAKING EDWARD'S PART,
COULD OVERCOME HER UNWILLINGNESS TO BE IN HER COMPANY AGAIN.
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS, THAT ELINOR SET OUT BY HERSELF
TO PAY A VISIT, FOR WHICH NO ONE COULD REALLY HAVE
LESS INCLINATION, AND TO RUN THE RISK OF A TETE-A-TETE
WITH A WOMAN, WHOM NEITHER OF THE OTHERS HAD SO MUCH
REASON TO DISLIKE.

MRS. DASHWOOD WAS DENIED; BUT BEFORE THE CARRIAGE COULD
TURN FROM THE HOUSE, HER HUSBAND ACCIDENTALLY CAME OUT.
HE EXPRESSED GREAT PLEASURE IN MEETING ELINOR, TOLD HER
THAT HE HAD BEEN JUST GOING TO CALL IN BERKELEY STREET,
AND, ASSURING HER THAT FANNY WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO SEE HER,
INVITED HER TO COME IN.

THEY WALKED UP STAIRS IN TO THE DRAWING-ROOM.--NOBODY WAS THERE.

"FANNY IS IN HER OWN ROOM, I SUPPOSE," SAID HE:--"I
WILL GO TO HER PRESENTLY, FOR I AM SURE SHE WILL NOT
HAVE THE LEAST OBJECTION IN THE WORLD TO SEEING YOU.--
VERY FAR FROM IT, INDEED.  NOW ESPECIALLY THERE
CANNOT BE--BUT HOWEVER, YOU AND MARIANNE WERE ALWAYS
GREAT FAVOURITES.--WHY WOULD NOT MARIANNE COME?"--

ELINOR MADE WHAT EXCUSE SHE COULD FOR HER.

"I AM NOT SORRY TO SEE YOU ALONE," HE REPLIED,
"FOR I HAVE A GOOD DEAL TO SAY TO YOU.  THIS LIVING
OF COLONEL BRANDON'S--CAN IT BE TRUE?--HAS HE REALLY GIVEN
IT TO EDWARD?--I HEARD IT YESTERDAY BY CHANCE, AND WAS
COMING TO YOU ON PURPOSE TO ENQUIRE FARTHER ABOUT IT."

"IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE.--COLONEL BRANDON HAS GIVEN
THE LIVING OF DELAFORD TO EDWARD."

"REALLY!--WELL, THIS IS VERY ASTONISHING!--NO
RELATIONSHIP!--NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM!--AND NOW
THAT LIVINGS FETCH SUCH A PRICE!--WHAT WAS THE VALUE OF THIS?"

"ABOUT TWO HUNDRED A YEAR."

"VERY WELL--AND FOR THE NEXT PRESENTATION TO A LIVING
OF THAT VALUE--SUPPOSING THE LATE INCUMBENT TO HAVE
BEEN OLD AND SICKLY, AND LIKELY TO VACATE IT SOON--HE
MIGHT HAVE GOT I DARE SAY--FOURTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS.
AND HOW CAME HE NOT TO HAVE SETTLED THAT MATTER BEFORE THIS
PERSON'S DEATH?--NOW INDEED IT WOULD BE TOO LATE TO SELL IT,
BUT A MAN OF COLONEL BRANDON'S SENSE!--I WONDER HE SHOULD
BE SO IMPROVIDENT IN A POINT OF SUCH COMMON, SUCH NATURAL,
CONCERN!--WELL, I AM CONVINCED THAT THERE IS A VAST DEAL
OF INCONSISTENCY IN ALMOST EVERY HUMAN CHARACTER.  I SUPPOSE,
HOWEVER--ON RECOLLECTION--THAT THE CASE MAY PROBABLY BE THIS.
EDWARD IS ONLY TO HOLD THE LIVING TILL THE PERSON TO WHOM
THE COLONEL HAS REALLY SOLD THE PRESENTATION, IS OLD ENOUGH
TO TAKE IT.--AYE, AYE, THAT IS THE FACT, DEPEND UPON IT."

ELINOR CONTRADICTED IT, HOWEVER, VERY POSITIVELY;
AND BY RELATING THAT SHE HAD HERSELF BEEN EMPLOYED
IN CONVEYING THE OFFER FROM COLONEL BRANDON TO EDWARD,
AND, THEREFORE, MUST UNDERSTAND THE TERMS ON WHICH IT
WAS GIVEN, OBLIGED HIM TO SUBMIT TO HER AUTHORITY.

"IT IS TRULY ASTONISHING!"--HE CRIED, AFTER HEARING
WHAT SHE SAID--"WHAT COULD BE THE COLONEL'S MOTIVE?"

"A VERY SIMPLE ONE--TO BE OF USE TO MR. FERRARS."

"WELL, WELL; WHATEVER COLONEL BRANDON MAY BE,
EDWARD IS A VERY LUCKY MAN.--YOU WILL NOT MENTION THE MATTER
TO FANNY, HOWEVER, FOR THOUGH I HAVE BROKE IT TO HER,
AND SHE BEARS IT VASTLY WELL,--SHE WILL NOT LIKE TO HEAR
IT MUCH TALKED OF."

ELINOR HAD SOME DIFFICULTY HERE TO REFRAIN FROM OBSERVING,
THAT SHE THOUGHT FANNY MIGHT HAVE BORNE WITH COMPOSURE,
AN ACQUISITION OF WEALTH TO HER BROTHER, BY WHICH NEITHER
SHE NOR HER CHILD COULD BE POSSIBLY IMPOVERISHED.

"MRS. FERRARS," ADDED HE, LOWERING HIS VOICE TO THE
TONE BECOMING SO IMPORTANT A SUBJECT, "KNOWS NOTHING
ABOUT IT AT PRESENT, AND I BELIEVE IT WILL BE BEST TO
KEEP IT ENTIRELY CONCEALED FROM HER AS LONG AS MAY BE.--
WHEN THE MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE, I FEAR SHE MUST HEAR
OF IT ALL."

"BUT WHY SHOULD SUCH PRECAUTION BE USED?--THOUGH
IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT MRS. FERRARS CAN HAVE
THE SMALLEST SATISFACTION IN KNOWING THAT HER SON HAS
MONEY ENOUGH TO LIVE UPON,--FOR THAT MUST BE QUITE
OUT OF THE QUESTION; YET WHY, UPON HER LATE BEHAVIOUR,
IS SHE SUPPOSED TO FEEL AT ALL?--SHE HAS DONE WITH HER
SON, SHE CAST HIM OFF FOR EVER, AND HAS MADE ALL THOSE
OVER WHOM SHE HAD ANY INFLUENCE, CAST HIM OFF LIKEWISE.
SURELY, AFTER DOING SO, SHE CANNOT BE IMAGINED LIABLE
TO ANY IMPRESSION OF SORROW OR OF JOY ON HIS ACCOUNT--
SHE CANNOT BE INTERESTED IN ANY THING THAT BEFALLS HIM.--
SHE WOULD NOT BE SO WEAK AS TO THROW AWAY THE COMFORT
OF A CHILD, AND YET RETAIN THE ANXIETY OF A PARENT!"

"AH! ELINOR," SAID JOHN, "YOUR REASONING IS VERY GOOD,
BUT IT IS FOUNDED ON IGNORANCE OF HUMAN NATURE.
WHEN EDWARD'S UNHAPPY MATCH TAKES PLACE, DEPEND UPON IT
HIS MOTHER WILL FEEL AS MUCH AS IF SHE HAD NEVER DISCARDED HIM;
AND, THEREFORE EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MAY ACCELERATE THAT
DREADFUL EVENT, MUST BE CONCEALED FROM HER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
MRS. FERRARS CAN NEVER FORGET THAT EDWARD IS HER SON."

"YOU SURPRISE ME; I SHOULD THINK IT MUST NEARLY
HAVE ESCAPED HER MEMORY BY THIS TIME."

"YOU WRONG HER EXCEEDINGLY.  MRS. FERRARS IS ONE
OF THE MOST AFFECTIONATE MOTHERS IN THE WORLD."

ELINOR WAS SILENT.

"WE THINK NOW,"--SAID MR. DASHWOOD, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE,
"OF ROBERT'S MARRYING MISS MORTON."

ELINOR, SMILING AT THE GRAVE AND DECISIVE IMPORTANCE
OF HER BROTHER'S TONE, CALMLY REPLIED,

"THE LADY, I SUPPOSE, HAS NO CHOICE IN THE AFFAIR."

"CHOICE!--HOW DO YOU MEAN?"

"I ONLY MEAN THAT I SUPPOSE, FROM YOUR MANNER
OF SPEAKING, IT MUST BE THE SAME TO MISS MORTON WHETHER
SHE MARRY EDWARD OR ROBERT."

"CERTAINLY, THERE CAN BE NO DIFFERENCE; FOR ROBERT
WILL NOW TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES BE CONSIDERED
AS THE ELDEST SON;--AND AS TO ANY THING ELSE, THEY ARE
BOTH VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MEN: I DO NOT KNOW THAT ONE
IS SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER."

ELINOR SAID NO MORE, AND JOHN WAS ALSO FOR A SHORT
TIME SILENT.--HIS REFLECTIONS ENDED THUS.

"OF ONE THING, MY DEAR SISTER," KINDLY TAKING HER HAND,
AND SPEAKING IN AN AWFUL WHISPER,--"I MAY ASSURE YOU;--
AND I WILL DO IT, BECAUSE I KNOW IT MUST GRATIFY YOU.
I HAVE GOOD REASON TO THINK--INDEED I HAVE IT FROM THE
BEST AUTHORITY, OR I SHOULD NOT REPEAT IT, FOR OTHERWISE
IT WOULD BE VERY WRONG TO SAY ANY THING ABOUT IT--BUT
I HAVE IT FROM THE VERY BEST AUTHORITY--NOT THAT I EVER
PRECISELY HEARD MRS. FERRARS SAY IT HERSELF--BUT HER
DAUGHTER DID, AND I HAVE IT FROM HER--THAT IN SHORT,
WHATEVER OBJECTIONS THERE MIGHT BE AGAINST A CERTAIN--A
CERTAIN CONNECTION--YOU UNDERSTAND ME--IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
FAR PREFERABLE TO HER, IT WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HER HALF
THE VEXATION THAT THIS DOES.  I WAS EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED
TO HEAR THAT MRS. FERRARS CONSIDERED IT IN THAT LIGHT--
A VERY GRATIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE YOU KNOW TO US ALL.
'IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BEYOND COMPARISON,' SHE SAID, 'THE LEAST
EVIL OF THE TWO, AND SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO COMPOUND NOW
FOR NOTHING WORSE.' BUT HOWEVER, ALL THAT IS QUITE OUT
OF THE QUESTION--NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF OR MENTIONED--
AS TO ANY ATTACHMENT YOU KNOW--IT NEVER COULD BE--ALL
THAT IS GONE BY.  BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST TELL YOU
OF THIS, BECAUSE I KNEW HOW MUCH IT MUST PLEASE YOU.
NOT THAT YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO REGRET, MY DEAR ELINOR.  THERE
IS NO DOUBT OF YOUR DOING EXCEEDINGLY WELL--QUITE AS WELL,
OR BETTER, PERHAPS, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  HAS COLONEL
BRANDON BEEN WITH YOU LATELY?"

ELINOR HAD HEARD ENOUGH, IF NOT TO GRATIFY HER VANITY,
AND RAISE HER SELF-IMPORTANCE, TO AGITATE HER NERVES
AND FILL HER MIND;--AND SHE WAS THEREFORE GLAD TO BE
SPARED FROM THE NECESSITY OF SAYING MUCH IN REPLY HERSELF,
AND FROM THE DANGER OF HEARING ANY THING MORE FROM
HER BROTHER, BY THE ENTRANCE OF MR. ROBERT FERRARS.
AFTER A FEW MOMENTS' CHAT, JOHN DASHWOOD, RECOLLECTING THAT
FANNY WAS YET UNINFORMED OF HER SISTER'S BEING THERE,
QUITTED THE ROOM IN QUEST OF HER; AND ELINOR WAS LEFT
TO IMPROVE HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH ROBERT, WHO, BY THE
GAY UNCONCERN, THE HAPPY SELF-COMPLACENCY OF HIS MANNER
WHILE ENJOYING SO UNFAIR A DIVISION OF HIS MOTHER'S LOVE
AND LIBERALITY, TO THE PREJUDICE OF HIS BANISHED BROTHER,
EARNED ONLY BY HIS OWN DISSIPATED COURSE OF LIFE, AND THAT
BROTHER'S INTEGRITY, WAS CONFIRMING HER MOST UNFAVOURABLE
OPINION OF HIS HEAD AND HEART.

THEY HAD SCARCELY BEEN TWO MINUTES BY THEMSELVES,
BEFORE HE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF EDWARD; FOR HE, TOO, HAD HEARD
OF THE LIVING, AND WAS VERY INQUISITIVE ON THE SUBJECT.
ELINOR REPEATED THE PARTICULARS OF IT, AS SHE HAD GIVEN THEM
TO JOHN; AND THEIR EFFECT ON ROBERT, THOUGH VERY DIFFERENT,
WAS NOT LESS STRIKING THAN IT HAD BEEN ON HIM.  HE LAUGHED
MOST IMMODERATELY.  THE IDEA OF EDWARD'S BEING A CLERGYMAN,
AND LIVING IN A SMALL PARSONAGE-HOUSE, DIVERTED HIM
BEYOND MEASURE;--AND WHEN TO THAT WAS ADDED THE FANCIFUL
IMAGERY OF EDWARD READING PRAYERS IN A WHITE SURPLICE,
AND PUBLISHING THE BANNS OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN JOHN SMITH AND
MARY BROWN, HE COULD CONCEIVE NOTHING MORE RIDICULOUS.

ELINOR, WHILE SHE WAITED IN SILENCE AND IMMOVABLE
GRAVITY, THE CONCLUSION OF SUCH FOLLY, COULD NOT RESTRAIN
HER EYES FROM BEING FIXED ON HIM WITH A LOOK THAT SPOKE
ALL THE CONTEMPT IT EXCITED.  IT WAS A LOOK, HOWEVER,
VERY WELL BESTOWED, FOR IT RELIEVED HER OWN FEELINGS, AND GAVE
NO INTELLIGENCE TO HIM.  HE WAS RECALLED FROM WIT TO WISDOM,
NOT BY ANY REPROOF OF HER'S, BUT BY HIS OWN SENSIBILITY.

"WE MAY TREAT IT AS A JOKE," SAID HE, AT LAST,
RECOVERING FROM THE AFFECTED LAUGH WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY
LENGTHENED OUT THE GENUINE GAIETY OF THE MOMENT--"BUT, UPON
MY SOUL, IT IS A MOST SERIOUS BUSINESS.  POOR EDWARD!
HE IS RUINED FOR EVER.  I AM EXTREMELY SORRY FOR IT--
FOR I KNOW HIM TO BE A VERY GOOD-HEARTED CREATURE; AS
WELL-MEANING A FELLOW PERHAPS, AS ANY IN THE WORLD.
YOU MUST NOT JUDGE OF HIM, MISS DASHWOOD, FROM YOUR
SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE.--POOR EDWARD!--HIS MANNERS ARE CERTAINLY
NOT THE HAPPIEST IN NATURE.--BUT WE ARE NOT ALL BORN,
YOU KNOW, WITH THE SAME POWERS,--THE SAME ADDRESS.--
POOR FELLOW!--TO SEE HIM IN A CIRCLE OF STRANGERS!--
TO BE SURE IT WAS PITIABLE ENOUGH!--BUT UPON MY SOUL,
I BELIEVE HE HAS AS GOOD A HEART AS ANY IN THE KINGDOM;
AND I DECLARE AND PROTEST TO YOU I NEVER WAS SO SHOCKED IN MY
LIFE, AS WHEN IT ALL BURST FORTH.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.--
MY MOTHER WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO TOLD ME OF IT;
AND I, FEELING MYSELF CALLED ON TO ACT WITH RESOLUTION,
IMMEDIATELY SAID TO HER, 'MY DEAR MADAM, I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT YOU MAY INTEND TO DO ON THE OCCASION, BUT AS FOR MYSELF,
I MUST SAY, THAT IF EDWARD DOES MARRY THIS YOUNG WOMAN,
I NEVER WILL SEE HIM AGAIN.' THAT WAS WHAT I SAID IMMEDIATELY.--
I WAS MOST UNCOMMONLY SHOCKED, INDEED!--POOR EDWARD!--HE HAS
DONE FOR HIMSELF COMPLETELY--SHUT HIMSELF OUT FOR EVER FROM
ALL DECENT SOCIETY!--BUT, AS I DIRECTLY SAID TO MY MOTHER,
I AM NOT IN THE LEAST SURPRISED AT IT; FROM HIS STYLE
OF EDUCATION, IT WAS ALWAYS TO BE EXPECTED.  MY POOR MOTHER
WAS HALF FRANTIC."

"HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE LADY?"

"YES; ONCE, WHILE SHE WAS STAYING IN THIS HOUSE,
I HAPPENED TO DROP IN FOR TEN MINUTES; AND I SAW
QUITE ENOUGH OF HER.  THE MEREST AWKWARD COUNTRY GIRL,
WITHOUT STYLE, OR ELEGANCE, AND ALMOST WITHOUT BEAUTY.--
I REMEMBER HER PERFECTLY.  JUST THE KIND OF GIRL I
SHOULD SUPPOSE LIKELY TO CAPTIVATE POOR EDWARD.
I OFFERED IMMEDIATELY, AS SOON AS MY MOTHER RELATED
THE AFFAIR TO ME, TO TALK TO HIM MYSELF, AND DISSUADE
HIM FROM THE MATCH; BUT IT WAS TOO LATE THEN, I FOUND,
TO DO ANY THING, FOR UNLUCKILY, I WAS NOT IN THE WAY
AT FIRST, AND KNEW NOTHING OF IT TILL AFTER THE BREACH
HAD TAKEN PLACE, WHEN IT WAS NOT FOR ME, YOU KNOW,
TO INTERFERE.  BUT HAD I BEEN INFORMED OF IT A FEW
HOURS EARLIER--I THINK IT IS MOST PROBABLE--THAT SOMETHING
MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIT ON.  I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE REPRESENTED
IT TO EDWARD IN A VERY STRONG LIGHT.  'MY DEAR FELLOW,'
I SHOULD HAVE SAID, 'CONSIDER WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
YOU ARE MAKING A MOST DISGRACEFUL CONNECTION, AND SUCH A ONE
AS YOUR FAMILY ARE UNANIMOUS IN DISAPPROVING.' I CANNOT
HELP THINKING, IN SHORT, THAT MEANS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOUND.
BUT NOW IT IS ALL TOO LATE.  HE MUST BE STARVED, YOU KNOW;--
THAT IS CERTAIN; ABSOLUTELY STARVED."

HE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WITH GREAT COMPOSURE,
WHEN THE ENTRANCE OF MRS. JOHN DASHWOOD PUT AN END TO THE
SUBJECT.
BUT THOUGH SHE NEVER SPOKE OF IT OUT OF HER OWN FAMILY,
ELINOR COULD SEE ITS INFLUENCE ON HER MIND, IN THE SOMETHING
LIKE CONFUSION OF COUNTENANCE WITH WHICH SHE ENTERED,
AND AN ATTEMPT AT CORDIALITY IN HER BEHAVIOUR TO HERSELF.
SHE EVEN PROCEEDED SO FAR AS TO BE CONCERNED TO FIND
THAT ELINOR AND HER SISTER WERE SO SOON TO LEAVE TOWN,
AS SHE HAD HOPED TO SEE MORE OF THEM;--AN EXERTION
IN WHICH HER HUSBAND, WHO ATTENDED HER INTO THE ROOM,
AND HUNG ENAMOURED OVER HER ACCENTS, SEEMED TO DISTINGUISH
EVERY THING THAT WAS MOST AFFECTIONATE AND GRACEFUL.



CHAPTER 42


ONE OTHER SHORT CALL IN HARLEY STREET, IN WHICH ELINOR
RECEIVED HER BROTHER'S CONGRATULATIONS ON THEIR TRAVELLING
SO FAR TOWARDS BARTON WITHOUT ANY EXPENSE, AND ON COLONEL
BRANDON'S BEING TO FOLLOW THEM TO CLEVELAND IN A DAY OR TWO,
COMPLETED THE INTERCOURSE OF THE BROTHER AND SISTERS
IN TOWN;--AND A FAINT INVITATION FROM FANNY, TO COME
TO NORLAND WHENEVER IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE IN THEIR WAY,
WHICH OF ALL THINGS WAS THE MOST UNLIKELY TO OCCUR,
WITH A MORE WARM, THOUGH LESS PUBLIC, ASSURANCE, FROM JOHN
TO ELINOR, OF THE PROMPTITUDE WITH WHICH HE SHOULD COME
TO SEE HER AT DELAFORD, WAS ALL THAT FORETOLD ANY MEETING
IN THE COUNTRY.

IT AMUSED HER TO OBSERVE THAT ALL HER FRIENDS SEEMED
DETERMINED TO SEND HER TO DELAFORD;--A PLACE, IN WHICH,
OF ALL OTHERS, SHE WOULD NOW LEAST CHUSE TO VISIT,
OR WISH TO RESIDE; FOR NOT ONLY WAS IT CONSIDERED AS
HER FUTURE HOME BY HER BROTHER AND MRS. JENNINGS, BUT EVEN LUCY,
WHEN THEY PARTED, GAVE HER A PRESSING INVITATION TO VISIT HER THERE.

VERY EARLY IN APRIL, AND TOLERABLY EARLY IN THE DAY,
THE TWO PARTIES FROM HANOVER SQUARE AND BERKELEY STREET SET
OUT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES, TO MEET, BY APPOINTMENT,
ON THE ROAD.  FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF CHARLOTTE AND HER CHILD,
THEY WERE TO BE MORE THAN TWO DAYS ON THEIR JOURNEY,
AND MR. PALMER, TRAVELLING MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY WITH COLONEL BRANDON,
WAS TO JOIN THEM AT CLEVELAND SOON AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL.

MARIANNE, FEW AS HAD BEEN HER HOURS OF COMFORT
IN LONDON, AND EAGER AS SHE HAD LONG BEEN TO QUIT IT,
COULD NOT, WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT, BID ADIEU TO
THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHE HAD FOR THE LAST TIME ENJOYED
THOSE HOPES, AND THAT CONFIDENCE, IN WILLOUGHBY,
WHICH WERE NOW EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER, WITHOUT GREAT PAIN.
NOR COULD SHE LEAVE THE PLACE IN WHICH WILLOUGHBY REMAINED,
BUSY IN NEW ENGAGEMENTS, AND NEW SCHEMES, IN WHICH SHE
COULD HAVE NO SHARE, WITHOUT SHEDDING MANY TEARS.

ELINOR'S SATISFACTION, AT THE MOMENT OF REMOVAL,
WAS MORE POSITIVE.  SHE HAD NO SUCH OBJECT FOR HER LINGERING
THOUGHTS TO FIX ON, SHE LEFT NO CREATURE BEHIND, FROM WHOM
IT WOULD GIVE HER A MOMENT'S REGRET TO BE DIVIDED FOR EVER,
SHE WAS PLEASED TO BE FREE HERSELF FROM THE PERSECUTION
OF LUCY'S FRIENDSHIP, SHE WAS GRATEFUL FOR BRINGING
HER SISTER AWAY UNSEEN BY WILLOUGHBY SINCE HIS MARRIAGE,
AND SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH HOPE TO WHAT A FEW MONTHS
OF TRANQUILITY AT BARTON MIGHT DO TOWARDS RESTORING
MARIANNE'S PEACE OF MIND, AND CONFIRMING HER OWN.

THEIR JOURNEY WAS SAFELY PERFORMED.  THE SECOND
DAY BROUGHT THEM INTO THE CHERISHED, OR THE PROHIBITED,
COUNTY OF SOMERSET, FOR AS SUCH WAS IT DWELT ON BY TURNS
IN MARIANNE'S IMAGINATION; AND IN THE FORENOON OF THE THIRD
THEY DROVE UP TO CLEVELAND.

CLEVELAND WAS A SPACIOUS, MODERN-BUILT HOUSE,
SITUATED ON A SLOPING LAWN.  IT HAD NO PARK, BUT THE
PLEASURE-GROUNDS WERE TOLERABLY EXTENSIVE; AND LIKE
EVERY OTHER PLACE OF THE SAME DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE,
IT HAD ITS OPEN SHRUBBERY, AND CLOSER WOOD WALK,
A ROAD OF SMOOTH GRAVEL WINDING ROUND A PLANTATION,
LED TO THE FRONT, THE LAWN WAS DOTTED OVER WITH TIMBER,
THE HOUSE ITSELF WAS UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE FIR,
THE MOUNTAIN-ASH, AND THE ACACIA, AND A THICK SCREEN OF
THEM ALTOGETHER, INTERSPERSED WITH TALL LOMBARDY POPLARS,
SHUT OUT THE OFFICES.

MARIANNE ENTERED THE HOUSE WITH A HEART SWELLING
WITH EMOTION FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING ONLY EIGHTY
MILES FROM BARTON, AND NOT THIRTY FROM COMBE MAGNA;
AND BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN FIVE MINUTES WITHIN ITS WALLS,
WHILE THE OTHERS WERE BUSILY HELPING CHARLOTTE TO SHOW
HER CHILD TO THE HOUSEKEEPER, SHE QUITTED IT AGAIN,
STEALING AWAY THROUGH THE WINDING SHRUBBERIES, NOW JUST
BEGINNING TO BE IN BEAUTY, TO GAIN A DISTANT EMINENCE;
WHERE, FROM ITS GRECIAN TEMPLE, HER EYE, WANDERING OVER
A WIDE TRACT OF COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH-EAST, COULD FONDLY
REST ON THE FARTHEST RIDGE OF HILLS IN THE HORIZON,
AND FANCY THAT FROM THEIR SUMMITS COMBE MAGNA MIGHT BE SEEN.

IN SUCH MOMENTS OF PRECIOUS, INVALUABLE MISERY,
SHE REJOICED IN TEARS OF AGONY TO BE AT CLEVELAND;
AND AS SHE RETURNED BY A DIFFERENT CIRCUIT TO THE HOUSE,
FEELING ALL THE HAPPY PRIVILEGE OF COUNTRY LIBERTY,
OF WANDERING FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN FREE AND LUXURIOUS SOLITUDE,
SHE RESOLVED TO SPEND ALMOST EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY
WHILE SHE REMAINED WITH THE PALMERS, IN THE INDULGENCE OF
SUCH SOLITARY RAMBLES.

SHE RETURNED JUST IN TIME TO JOIN THE OTHERS
AS THEY QUITTED THE HOUSE, ON AN EXCURSION THROUGH ITS
MORE IMMEDIATE PREMISES; AND THE REST OF THE MORNING WAS
EASILY WHILED AWAY, IN LOUNGING ROUND THE KITCHEN GARDEN,
EXAMINING THE BLOOM UPON ITS WALLS, AND LISTENING TO THE
GARDENER'S LAMENTATIONS UPON BLIGHTS, IN DAWDLING THROUGH
THE GREEN-HOUSE, WHERE THE LOSS OF HER FAVOURITE PLANTS,
UNWARILY EXPOSED, AND NIPPED BY THE LINGERING FROST,
RAISED THE LAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE,--AND IN VISITING HER
POULTRY-YARD, WHERE, IN THE DISAPPOINTED HOPES OF HER
DAIRY-MAID, BY HENS FORSAKING THEIR NESTS, OR BEING
STOLEN BY A FOX, OR IN THE RAPID DECREASE OF A PROMISING
YOUNG BROOD, SHE FOUND FRESH SOURCES OF MERRIMENT.

THE MORNING WAS FINE AND DRY, AND MARIANNE,
IN HER PLAN OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD, HAD NOT CALCULATED
FOR ANY CHANGE OF WEATHER DURING THEIR STAY AT CLEVELAND.
WITH GREAT SURPRISE THEREFORE, DID SHE FIND HERSELF PREVENTED
BY A SETTLED RAIN FROM GOING OUT AGAIN AFTER DINNER.
SHE HAD DEPENDED ON A TWILIGHT WALK TO THE GRECIAN TEMPLE,
AND PERHAPS ALL OVER THE GROUNDS, AND AN EVENING MERELY
COLD OR DAMP WOULD NOT HAVE DETERRED HER FROM IT;
BUT A HEAVY AND SETTLED RAIN EVEN SHE COULD NOT FANCY DRY
OR PLEASANT WEATHER FOR WALKING.

THEIR PARTY WAS SMALL, AND THE HOURS PASSED QUIETLY AWAY.
MRS. PALMER HAD HER CHILD, AND MRS. JENNINGS HER CARPET-WORK;
THEY TALKED OF THE FRIENDS THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND,
ARRANGED LADY MIDDLETON'S ENGAGEMENTS, AND WONDERED
WHETHER MR. PALMER AND COLONEL BRANDON WOULD GET FARTHER
THAN READING THAT NIGHT.  ELINOR, HOWEVER LITTLE CONCERNED
IN IT, JOINED IN THEIR DISCOURSE; AND MARIANNE, WHO HAD
THE KNACK OF FINDING HER WAY IN EVERY HOUSE TO THE LIBRARY,
HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE AVOIDED BY THE FAMILY IN GENERAL,
SOON PROCURED HERSELF A BOOK.

NOTHING WAS WANTING ON MRS. PALMER'S SIDE THAT CONSTANT
AND FRIENDLY GOOD HUMOUR COULD DO, TO MAKE THEM FEEL
THEMSELVES WELCOME.  THE OPENNESS AND HEARTINESS OF HER
MANNER MORE THAN ATONED FOR THAT WANT OF RECOLLECTION
AND ELEGANCE WHICH MADE HER OFTEN DEFICIENT IN THE FORMS
OF POLITENESS; HER KINDNESS, RECOMMENDED BY SO PRETTY
A FACE, WAS ENGAGING; HER FOLLY, THOUGH EVIDENT
WAS NOT DISGUSTING, BECAUSE IT WAS NOT CONCEITED;
AND ELINOR COULD HAVE FORGIVEN EVERY THING BUT HER LAUGH.

THE TWO GENTLEMEN ARRIVED THE NEXT DAY TO A VERY
LATE DINNER, AFFORDING A PLEASANT ENLARGEMENT OF THE PARTY,
AND A VERY WELCOME VARIETY TO THEIR CONVERSATION, WHICH A
LONG MORNING OF THE SAME CONTINUED RAIN HAD REDUCED VERY LOW.

ELINOR HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF MR. PALMER, AND IN THAT
LITTLE HAD SEEN SO MUCH VARIETY IN HIS ADDRESS TO HER
SISTER AND HERSELF, THAT SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO EXPECT
TO FIND HIM IN HIS OWN FAMILY.  SHE FOUND HIM, HOWEVER,
PERFECTLY THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ALL HIS VISITORS,
AND ONLY OCCASIONALLY RUDE TO HIS WIFE AND HER MOTHER;
SHE FOUND HIM VERY CAPABLE OF BEING A PLEASANT COMPANION,
AND ONLY PREVENTED FROM BEING SO ALWAYS, BY TOO GREAT
AN APTITUDE TO FANCY HIMSELF AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE
IN GENERAL, AS HE MUST FEEL HIMSELF TO BE TO MRS. JENNINGS
AND CHARLOTTE.  FOR THE REST OF HIS CHARACTER AND HABITS,
THEY WERE MARKED, AS FAR AS ELINOR COULD PERCEIVE,
WITH NO TRAITS AT ALL UNUSUAL IN HIS SEX AND TIME OF LIFE.
HE WAS NICE IN HIS EATING, UNCERTAIN IN HIS HOURS;
FOND OF HIS CHILD, THOUGH AFFECTING TO SLIGHT IT;
AND IDLED AWAY THE MORNINGS AT BILLIARDS, WHICH OUGHT
TO HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO BUSINESS.  SHE LIKED HIM, HOWEVER,
UPON THE WHOLE, MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED, AND IN
HER HEART WAS NOT SORRY THAT SHE COULD LIKE HIM NO MORE;--
NOT SORRY TO BE DRIVEN BY THE OBSERVATION OF HIS EPICURISM,
HIS SELFISHNESS, AND HIS CONCEIT, TO REST WITH COMPLACENCY
ON THE REMEMBRANCE OF EDWARD'S GENEROUS TEMPER, SIMPLE TASTE,
AND DIFFIDENT FEELINGS.

OF EDWARD, OR AT LEAST OF SOME OF HIS CONCERNS,
SHE NOW RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE FROM COLONEL BRANDON,
WHO HAD BEEN INTO DORSETSHIRE LATELY; AND WHO,
TREATING HER AT ONCE AS THE DISINTERESTED FRIEND
OF MR. FERRARS, AND THE KIND OF CONFIDANT OF HIMSELF,
TALKED TO HER A GREAT DEAL OF THE PARSONAGE AT DELAFORD,
DESCRIBED ITS DEFICIENCIES, AND TOLD HER WHAT HE MEANT
TO DO HIMSELF TOWARDS REMOVING THEM.--HIS BEHAVIOUR
TO HER IN THIS, AS WELL AS IN EVERY OTHER PARTICULAR,
HIS OPEN PLEASURE IN MEETING HER AFTER AN ABSENCE
OF ONLY TEN DAYS, HIS READINESS TO CONVERSE WITH HER,
AND HIS DEFERENCE FOR HER OPINION, MIGHT VERY WELL
JUSTIFY MRS. JENNINGS'S PERSUASION OF HIS ATTACHMENT,
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH, PERHAPS, HAD NOT ELINOR STILL,
AS FROM THE FIRST, BELIEVED MARIANNE HIS REAL FAVOURITE,
TO MAKE HER SUSPECT IT HERSELF.  BUT AS IT WAS,
SUCH A NOTION HAD SCARCELY EVER ENTERED HER HEAD,
EXCEPT BY MRS. JENNINGS'S SUGGESTION; AND SHE COULD
NOT HELP BELIEVING HERSELF THE NICEST OBSERVER OF THE
TWO;--SHE WATCHED HIS EYES, WHILE MRS. JENNINGS THOUGHT
ONLY OF HIS BEHAVIOUR;--AND WHILE HIS LOOKS OF ANXIOUS
SOLICITUDE ON MARIANNE'S FEELING, IN HER HEAD AND THROAT,
THE BEGINNING OF A HEAVY COLD, BECAUSE UNEXPRESSED BY WORDS,
ENTIRELY ESCAPED THE LATTER LADY'S OBSERVATION;--SHE COULD
DISCOVER IN THEM THE QUICK FEELINGS, AND NEEDLESS ALARM
OF A LOVER.

TWO DELIGHFUL TWILIGHT WALKS ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH
EVENINGS OF HER BEING THERE, NOT MERELY ON THE DRY GRAVEL
OF THE SHRUBBERY, BUT ALL OVER THE GROUNDS, AND ESPECIALLY
IN THE MOST DISTANT PARTS OF THEM, WHERE THERE WAS SOMETHING
MORE OF WILDNESS THAN IN THE REST, WHERE THE TREES WERE
THE OLDEST, AND THE GRASS WAS THE LONGEST AND WETTEST,
HAD--ASSISTED BY THE STILL GREATER IMPRUDENCE OF SITTING
IN HER WET SHOES AND STOCKINGS--GIVEN MARIANNE A COLD
SO VIOLENT AS, THOUGH FOR A DAY OR TWO TRIFLED WITH
OR DENIED, WOULD FORCE ITSELF BY INCREASING AILMENTS ON
THE CONCERN OF EVERY BODY, AND THE NOTICE OF HERSELF.
PRESCRIPTIONS POURED IN FROM ALL QUARTERS, AND AS USUAL,
WERE ALL DECLINED.  THOUGH HEAVY AND FEVERISH, WITH A PAIN
IN HER LIMBS, AND A COUGH, AND A SORE THROAT, A GOOD NIGHT'S
REST WAS TO CURE HER ENTIRELY; AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY
THAT ELINOR PREVAILED ON HER, WHEN SHE WENT TO BED,
TO TRY ONE OR TWO OF THE SIMPLEST OF THE REMEDIES.



CHAPTER 43


MARIANNE GOT UP THE NEXT MORNING AT HER USUAL TIME;
TO EVERY INQUIRY REPLIED THAT SHE WAS BETTER, AND TRIED TO
PROVE HERSELF SO, BY ENGAGING IN HER ACCUSTOMARY EMPLOYMENTS.
BUT A DAY SPENT IN SITTING SHIVERING OVER THE FIRE
WITH A BOOK IN HER HAND, WHICH SHE WAS UNABLE TO READ,
OR IN LYING, WEARY AND LANGUID, ON A SOFA, DID NOT SPEAK
MUCH IN FAVOUR OF HER AMENDMENT; AND WHEN, AT LAST,
SHE WENT EARLY TO BED, MORE AND MORE INDISPOSED, COLONEL
BRANDON WAS ONLY ASTONISHED AT HER SISTER'S COMPOSURE,
WHO, THOUGH ATTENDING AND NURSING HER THE WHOLE DAY,
AGAINST MARIANNE INCLINATION, AND FORCING PROPER MEDICINES
ON HER AT NIGHT, TRUSTED, LIKE MARIANNE, TO THE CERTAINTY
AND EFFICACY OF SLEEP, AND FELT NO REAL ALARM.

A VERY RESTLESS AND FEVERISH NIGHT, HOWEVER,
DISAPPOINTED THE EXPECTATION OF BOTH; AND WHEN MARIANNE,
AFTER PERSISTING IN RISING, CONFESSED HERSELF UNABLE
TO SIT UP, AND RETURNED VOLUNTARILY TO HER BED,
ELINOR WAS VERY READY TO ADOPT MRS. JENNINGS'S ADVICE,
OF SENDING FOR THE PALMERS' APOTHECARY.

HE CAME, EXAMINED HIS PATIENT, AND THOUGH ENCOURAGING
MISS DASHWOOD TO EXPECT THAT A VERY FEW DAYS WOULD RESTORE
HER SISTER TO HEALTH, YET, BY PRONOUNCING HER DISORDER
TO HAVE A PUTRID TENDENCY, AND ALLOWING THE WORD "INFECTION"
TO PASS HIS LIPS, GAVE INSTANT ALARM TO MRS. PALMER,
ON HER BABY'S ACCOUNT.  MRS. JENNINGS, WHO HAD BEEN INCLINED
FROM THE FIRST TO THINK MARIANNE'S COMPLAINT MORE SERIOUS
THAN ELINOR, NOW LOOKED VERY GRAVE ON MR. HARRIS'S REPORT,
AND CONFIRMING CHARLOTTE'S FEARS AND CAUTION, URGED THE
NECESSITY OF HER IMMEDIATE REMOVAL WITH HER INFANT;
AND MR. PALMER, THOUGH TREATING THEIR APPREHENSIONS AS IDLE,
FOUND THE ANXIETY AND IMPORTUNITY OF HIS WIFE TOO GREAT
TO BE WITHSTOOD.  HER DEPARTURE, THEREFORE, WAS FIXED ON;
AND WITHIN AN HOUR AFTER MR. HARRIS'S ARRIVAL, SHE SET OFF,
WITH HER LITTLE BOY AND HIS NURSE, FOR THE HOUSE OF A
NEAR RELATION OF MR. PALMER'S, WHO LIVED A FEW MILES
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BATH; WHITHER HER HUSBAND PROMISED,
AT HER EARNEST ENTREATY, TO JOIN HER IN A DAY OR TWO;
AND WHITHER SHE WAS ALMOST EQUALLY URGENT WITH HER
MOTHER TO ACCOMPANY HER.  MRS. JENNINGS, HOWEVER, WITH A
KINDNESS OF HEART WHICH MADE ELINOR REALLY LOVE HER,
DECLARED HER RESOLUTION OF NOT STIRRING FROM CLEVELAND
AS LONG AS MARIANNE REMAINED ILL, AND OF ENDEAVOURING,
BY HER OWN ATTENTIVE CARE, TO SUPPLY TO HER THE PLACE
OF THE MOTHER SHE HAD TAKEN HER FROM; AND ELINOR FOUND HER
ON EVERY OCCASION A MOST WILLING AND ACTIVE HELPMATE,
DESIROUS TO SHARE IN ALL HER FATIGUES, AND OFTEN BY HER
BETTER EXPERIENCE IN NURSING, OF MATERIAL USE.

POOR MARIANNE, LANGUID AND LOW FROM THE NATURE
OF HER MALADY, AND FEELING HERSELF UNIVERSALLY ILL,
COULD NO LONGER HOPE THAT TOMORROW WOULD FIND HER RECOVERED;
AND THE IDEA OF WHAT TOMORROW WOULD HAVE PRODUCED,
BUT FOR THIS UNLUCKY ILLNESS, MADE EVERY AILMENT SEVERE;
FOR ON THAT DAY THEY WERE TO HAVE BEGUN THEIR JOURNEY HOME;
AND, ATTENDED THE WHOLE WAY BY A SERVANT OF MRS. JENNINGS,
WERE TO HAVE TAKEN THEIR MOTHER BY SURPRISE ON THE
FOLLOWING FORENOON.  THE LITTLE SHE SAID WAS ALL IN
LAMENTATION OF THIS INEVITABLE DELAY; THOUGH ELINOR TRIED
TO RAISE HER SPIRITS, AND MAKE HER BELIEVE, AS SHE THEN
REALLY BELIEVED HERSELF, THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY SHORT ONE.

THE NEXT DAY PRODUCED LITTLE OR NO ALTERATION IN THE
STATE OF THE PATIENT; SHE CERTAINLY WAS NOT BETTER, AND,
EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS NO AMENDMENT, DID NOT APPEAR WORSE.
THEIR PARTY WAS NOW FARTHER REDUCED; FOR MR. PALMER,
THOUGH VERY UNWILLING TO GO AS WELL FROM REAL HUMANITY
AND GOOD-NATURE, AS FROM A DISLIKE OF APPEARING TO BE
FRIGHTENED AWAY BY HIS WIFE, WAS PERSUADED AT LAST
BY COLONEL BRANDON TO PERFORM HIS PROMISE OF FOLLOWING HER;
AND WHILE HE WAS PREPARING TO GO, COLONEL BRANDON HIMSELF,
WITH A MUCH GREATER EXERTION, BEGAN TO TALK OF GOING
LIKEWISE.--HERE, HOWEVER, THE KINDNESS OF MRS. JENNINGS
INTERPOSED MOST ACCEPTABLY; FOR TO SEND THE COLONEL AWAY
WHILE HIS LOVE WAS IN SO MUCH UNEASINESS ON HER SISTER'S
ACCOUNT, WOULD BE TO DEPRIVE THEM BOTH, SHE THOUGHT,
OF EVERY COMFORT; AND THEREFORE TELLING HIM AT ONCE
THAT HIS STAY AT CLEVELAND WAS NECESSARY TO HERSELF,
THAT SHE SHOULD WANT HIM TO PLAY AT PIQUET OF AN EVENING,
WHILE MISS DASHWOOD WAS ABOVE WITH HER SISTER, &C. SHE
URGED HIM SO STRONGLY TO REMAIN, THAT HE, WHO WAS GRATIFYING
THE FIRST WISH OF HIS OWN HEART BY A COMPLIANCE, COULD NOT
LONG EVEN AFFECT TO DEMUR; ESPECIALLY AS MRS. JENNINGS'S
ENTREATY WAS WARMLY SECONDED BY MR. PALMER, WHO SEEMED
TO FEEL A RELIEF TO HIMSELF, IN LEAVING BEHIND HIM A PERSON
SO WELL ABLE TO ASSIST OR ADVISE MISS DASHWOOD IN ANY EMERGENCE.

MARIANNE WAS, OF COURSE, KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF ALL
THESE ARRANGEMENTS.  SHE KNEW NOT THAT SHE HAD BEEN
THE MEANS OF SENDING THE OWNERS OF CLEVELAND AWAY,
IN ABOUT SEVEN DAYS FROM THE TIME OF THEIR ARRIVAL.
IT GAVE HER NO SURPRISE THAT SHE SAW NOTHING
OF MRS. PALMER; AND AS IT GAVE HER LIKEWISE NO CONCERN,
SHE NEVER MENTIONED HER NAME.

TWO DAYS PASSED AWAY FROM THE TIME OF MR. PALMER'S DEPARTURE,
AND HER SITUATION CONTINUED, WITH LITTLE VARIATION,
THE SAME.  MR. HARRIS, WHO ATTENDED HER EVERY DAY,
STILL TALKED BOLDLY OF A SPEEDY RECOVERY, AND MISS DASHWOOD
WAS EQUALLY SANGUINE; BUT THE EXPECTATION OF THE OTHERS
WAS BY NO MEANS SO CHEERFUL.  MRS. JENNINGS HAD DETERMINED
VERY EARLY IN THE SEIZURE THAT MARIANNE WOULD NEVER
GET OVER IT, AND COLONEL BRANDON, WHO WAS CHIEFLY
OF USE IN LISTENING TO MRS. JENNINGS'S FOREBODINGS,
WAS NOT IN A STATE OF MIND TO RESIST THEIR INFLUENCE.
HE TRIED TO REASON HIMSELF OUT OF FEARS, WHICH THE DIFFERENT
JUDGMENT OF THE APOTHECARY SEEMED TO RENDER ABSURD;
BUT THE MANY HOURS OF EACH DAY IN WHICH HE WAS LEFT
ENTIRELY ALONE, WERE BUT TOO FAVOURABLE FOR THE ADMISSION
OF EVERY MELANCHOLY IDEA, AND HE COULD NOT EXPEL FROM
HIS MIND THE PERSUASION THAT HE SHOULD SEE MARIANNE NO MORE.

ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY HOWEVER, THE GLOOMY
ANTICIPATIONS OF BOTH WERE ALMOST DONE AWAY; FOR WHEN
MR. HARRIS ARRIVED, HE DECLARED HIS PATIENT MATERIALLY BETTER.
HER PULSE WAS MUCH STRONGER, AND EVERY SYMPTOM MORE FAVOURABLE
THAN ON THE PRECEDING VISIT.  ELINOR, CONFIRMED IN EVERY
PLEASANT HOPE, WAS ALL CHEERFULNESS; REJOICING THAT
IN HER LETTERS TO HER MOTHER, SHE HAD PURSUED HER OWN
JUDGMENT RATHER THAN HER FRIEND'S, IN MAKING VERY LIGHT
OF THE INDISPOSITION WHICH DELAYED THEM AT CLEVELAND;
AND ALMOST FIXING ON THE TIME WHEN MARIANNE WOULD BE
ABLE TO TRAVEL.

BUT THE DAY DID NOT CLOSE SO AUSPICIOUSLY AS IT BEGAN.--
TOWARDS THE EVENING MARIANNE BECAME ILL AGAIN, GROWING
MORE HEAVY, RESTLESS, AND UNCOMFORTABLE THAN BEFORE.
HER SISTER, HOWEVER, STILL SANGUINE, WAS WILLING TO
ATTRIBUTE THE CHANGE TO NOTHING MORE THAN THE FATIGUE
OF HAVING SAT UP TO HAVE HER BED MADE; AND CAREFULLY
ADMINISTERING THE CORDIALS PRESCRIBED, SAW HER, WITH
SATISFACTION, SINK AT LAST INTO A SLUMBER, FROM WHICH
SHE EXPECTED THE MOST BENEFICIAL EFFECTS.  HER SLEEP,
THOUGH NOT SO QUIET AS ELINOR WISHED TO SEE IT,
LASTED A CONSIDERABLE TIME; AND ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE
THE RESULT OF IT HERSELF, SHE RESOLVED TO SIT WITH HER
DURING THE WHOLE OF IT.  MRS. JENNINGS, KNOWING NOTHING
OF ANY CHANGE IN THE PATIENT, WENT UNUSUALLY EARLY TO BED;
HER MAID, WHO WAS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL NURSES, WAS RECREATING
HERSELF IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM, AND ELINOR REMAINED
ALONE WITH MARIANNE.

THE REPOSE OF THE LATTER BECAME MORE AND MORE DISTURBED;
AND HER SISTER, WHO WATCHED, WITH UNREMITTING ATTENTION
HER CONTINUAL CHANGE OF POSTURE, AND HEARD THE FREQUENT
BUT INARTICULATE SOUNDS OF COMPLAINT WHICH PASSED HER LIPS,
WAS ALMOST WISHING TO ROUSE HER FROM SO PAINFUL A SLUMBER,
WHEN MARIANNE, SUDDENLY AWAKENED BY SOME ACCIDENTAL NOISE
IN THE HOUSE, STARTED HASTILY UP, AND, WITH FEVERISH WILDNESS,
CRIED OUT,--

"IS MAMA COMING?--"

"NOT YET," CRIED THE OTHER, CONCEALING HER TERROR,
AND ASSISTING MARIANNE TO LIE DOWN AGAIN, "BUT SHE WILL
BE HERE, I HOPE, BEFORE IT IS LONG.  IT IS A GREAT WAY,
YOU KNOW, FROM HENCE TO BARTON."

"BUT SHE MUST NOT GO ROUND BY LONDON," CRIED MARIANNE,
IN THE SAME HURRIED MANNER.  "I SHALL NEVER SEE HER,
IF SHE GOES BY LONDON."

ELINOR PERCEIVED WITH ALARM THAT SHE WAS NOT
QUITE HERSELF, AND, WHILE ATTEMPTING TO SOOTHE HER,
EAGERLY FELT HER PULSE.  IT WAS LOWER AND QUICKER THAN EVER!
AND MARIANNE, STILL TALKING WILDLY OF MAMA, HER ALARM
INCREASED SO RAPIDLY, AS TO DETERMINE HER ON SENDING
INSTANTLY FOR MR. HARRIS, AND DESPATCHING A MESSENGER
TO BARTON FOR HER MOTHER.  TO CONSULT WITH COLONEL BRANDON
ON THE BEST MEANS OF EFFECTING THE LATTER, WAS A THOUGHT
WHICH IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE RESOLUTION OF ITS PERFORMANCE;
AND AS SOON SHE HAD RUNG UP THE MAID TO TAKE HER PLACE
BY HER SISTER, SHE HASTENED DOWN TO THE DRAWING-ROOM,
WHERE SHE KNEW HE WAS GENERALLY TO BE FOUND AT A MUCH
LATER HOUR THAN THE PRESENT.

IT WAS NO TIME FOR HESITATION.  HER FEARS AND HER
DIFFICULTIES WERE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HIM.  HER FEARS,
HE HAD NO COURAGE, NO CONFIDENCE TO ATTEMPT THE REMOVAL OF:--
HE LISTENED TO THEM IN SILENT DESPONDENCE;--BUT HER
DIFFICULTIES WERE INSTANTLY OBVIATED, FOR WITH A READINESS
THAT SEEMED TO SPEAK THE OCCASION, AND THE SERVICE
PRE-ARRANGED IN HIS MIND, HE OFFERED HIMSELF AS THE
MESSENGER WHO SHOULD FETCH MRS. DASHWOOD.  ELINOR MADE NO
RESISTANCE THAT WAS NOT EASILY OVERCOME.  SHE THANKED HIM
WITH BRIEF, THOUGH FERVENT GRATITUDE, AND WHILE HE WENT
TO HURRY OFF HIS SERVANT WITH A MESSAGE TO MR. HARRIS, AND
AN ORDER FOR POST-HORSES DIRECTLY, SHE WROTE A FEW LINES
TO HER MOTHER.

THE COMFORT OF SUCH A FRIEND AT THAT MOMENT AS COLONEL
BRANDON--OR SUCH A COMPANION FOR HER MOTHER,--HOW GRATEFULLY
WAS IT FELT!--A COMPANION WHOSE JUDGMENT WOULD GUIDE,
WHOSE ATTENDANCE MUST RELIEVE, AND WHOSE FRIENDSHIP MIGHT
SOOTHE HER!--AS FAR AS THE SHOCK OF SUCH A SUMMONS COULD
BE LESSENED TO HER, HIS PRESENCE, HIS MANNERS, HIS ASSISTANCE,
WOULD LESSEN IT.

HE, MEANWHILE, WHATEVER HE MIGHT FEEL, ACTED WITH ALL
THE FIRMNESS OF A COLLECTED MIND, MADE EVERY NECESSARY
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE UTMOST DESPATCH, AND CALCULATED
WITH EXACTNESS THE TIME IN WHICH SHE MIGHT LOOK FOR
HIS RETURN.  NOT A MOMENT WAS LOST IN DELAY OF ANY KIND.
THE HORSES ARRIVED, EVEN BEFORE THEY WERE EXPECTED,
AND COLONEL BRANDON ONLY PRESSING HER HAND WITH A LOOK
OF SOLEMNITY, AND A FEW WORDS SPOKEN TOO LOW TO REACH HER EAR,
HURRIED INTO THE CARRIAGE.  IT WAS THEN ABOUT TWELVE
O'CLOCK, AND SHE RETURNED TO HER SISTER'S APARTMENT TO WAIT
FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE APOTHECARY, AND TO WATCH BY HER
THE REST OF THE NIGHT.  IT WAS A NIGHT OF ALMOST EQUAL
SUFFERING TO BOTH.  HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED AWAY IN SLEEPLESS
PAIN AND DELIRIUM ON MARIANNE'S SIDE, AND IN THE MOST
CRUEL ANXIETY ON ELINOR'S, BEFORE MR. HARRIS APPEARED.
HER APPREHENSIONS ONCE RAISED, PAID BY THEIR EXCESS FOR ALL
HER FORMER SECURITY; AND THE SERVANT WHO SAT UP WITH HER,
FOR SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW MRS. JENNINGS TO BE CALLED,
ONLY TORTURED HER MORE, BY HINTS OF WHAT HER MISTRESS
HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT.

MARIANNE'S IDEAS WERE STILL, AT INTERVALS,
FIXED INCOHERENTLY ON HER MOTHER, AND WHENEVER SHE
MENTIONED HER NAME, IT GAVE A PANG TO THE HEART OF
POOR ELINOR, WHO, REPROACHING HERSELF FOR HAVING TRIFLED
WITH SO MANY DAYS OF ILLNESS, AND WRETCHED FOR SOME
IMMEDIATE RELIEF, FANCIED THAT ALL RELIEF MIGHT SOON
BE IN VAIN, THAT EVERY THING HAD BEEN DELAYED TOO LONG,
AND PICTURED TO HERSELF HER SUFFERING MOTHER ARRIVING
TOO LATE TO SEE THIS DARLING CHILD, OR TO SEE HER RATIONAL.

SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF SENDING AGAIN FOR MR. HARRIS,
OR IF HE COULD NOT COME, FOR SOME OTHER ADVICE,
WHEN THE FORMER--BUT NOT TILL AFTER FIVE O'CLOCK--ARRIVED.
HIS OPINION, HOWEVER, MADE SOME LITTLE AMENDS FOR HIS DELAY,
FOR THOUGH ACKNOWLEDGING A VERY UNEXPECTED AND UNPLEASANT
ALTERATION IN HIS PATIENT, HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE DANGER
TO BE MATERIAL, AND TALKED OF THE RELIEF WHICH A FRESH
MODE OF TREATMENT MUST PROCURE, WITH A CONFIDENCE WHICH,
IN A LESSER DEGREE, WAS COMMUNICATED TO ELINOR.  HE PROMISED
TO CALL AGAIN IN THE COURSE OF THREE OR FOUR HOURS,
AND LEFT BOTH THE PATIENT AND HER ANXIOUS ATTENDANT MORE
COMPOSED THAN HE HAD FOUND THEM.

WITH STRONG CONCERN, AND WITH MANY REPROACHES FOR NOT
BEING CALLED TO THEIR AID, DID MRS. JENNINGS HEAR IN THE
MORNING OF WHAT HAD PASSED.  HER FORMER APPREHENSIONS,
NOW WITH GREATER REASON RESTORED, LEFT HER NO DOUBT OF
THE EVENT; AND THOUGH TRYING TO SPEAK COMFORT TO ELINOR,
HER CONVICTION OF HER SISTER'S DANGER WOULD NOT ALLOW HER
TO OFFER THE COMFORT OF HOPE.  HER HEART WAS REALLY GRIEVED.
THE RAPID DECAY, THE EARLY DEATH OF A GIRL SO YOUNG,
SO LOVELY AS MARIANNE, MUST HAVE STRUCK A LESS INTERESTED
PERSON WITH CONCERN.  ON MRS. JENNINGS'S COMPASSION
SHE HAD OTHER CLAIMS.  SHE HAD BEEN FOR THREE MONTHS
HER COMPANION, WAS STILL UNDER HER CARE, AND SHE WAS
KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN GREATLY INJURED, AND LONG UNHAPPY.
THE DISTRESS OF HER SISTER TOO, PARTICULARLY A FAVOURITE,
WAS BEFORE HER;--AND AS FOR THEIR MOTHER, WHEN MRS. JENNINGS
CONSIDERED THAT MARIANNE MIGHT PROBABLY BE TO HER WHAT
CHARLOTTE WAS TO HERSELF, HER SYMPATHY IN HER SUFFERINGS
WAS VERY SINCERE.

MR. HARRIS WAS PUNCTUAL IN HIS SECOND VISIT;--
BUT HE CAME TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN HIS HOPES OF WHAT THE
LAST WOULD PRODUCE.  HIS MEDICINES HAD FAILED;--THE FEVER
WAS UNABATED; AND MARIANNE ONLY MORE QUIET--NOT MORE
HERSELF--REMAINED IN A HEAVY STUPOR.  ELINOR, CATCHING ALL,
AND MORE THAN ALL, HIS FEARS IN A MOMENT, PROPOSED TO CALL
IN FURTHER ADVICE.  BUT HE JUDGED IT UNNECESSARY: HE HAD
STILL SOMETHING MORE TO TRY, SOME MORE FRESH APPLICATION,
OF WHOSE SUCCESS HE WAS AS CONFIDENT AS THE LAST, AND HIS
VISIT CONCLUDED WITH ENCOURAGING ASSURANCES WHICH REACHED
THE EAR, BUT COULD NOT ENTER THE HEART OF MISS DASHWOOD.
SHE WAS CALM, EXCEPT WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER MOTHER;
BUT SHE WAS ALMOST HOPELESS; AND IN THIS STATE SHE CONTINUED
TILL NOON, SCARCELY STIRRING FROM HER SISTER'S BED,
HER THOUGHTS WANDERING FROM ONE IMAGE OF GRIEF,
ONE SUFFERING FRIEND TO ANOTHER, AND HER SPIRITS OPPRESSED
TO THE UTMOST BY THE CONVERSATION OF MRS. JENNINGS,
WHO SCRUPLED NOT TO ATTRIBUTE THE SEVERITY AND DANGER
OF THIS ATTACK TO THE MANY WEEKS OF PREVIOUS INDISPOSITION
WHICH MARIANNE'S DISAPPOINTMENT HAD BROUGHT ON.
ELINOR FELT ALL THE REASONABLENESS OF THE IDEA, AND IT
GAVE FRESH MISERY TO HER REFLECTIONS.

ABOUT NOON, HOWEVER, SHE BEGAN--BUT WITH A CAUTION--A
DREAD OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH FOR SOME TIME KEPT HER SILENT,
EVEN TO HER FRIEND--TO FANCY, TO HOPE SHE COULD PERCEIVE
A SLIGHT AMENDMENT IN HER SISTER'S PULSE;--SHE WAITED,
WATCHED, AND EXAMINED IT AGAIN AND AGAIN;--AND AT LAST,
WITH AN AGITATION MORE DIFFICULT TO BURY UNDER EXTERIOR CALMNESS,
THAN ALL HER FOREGOING DISTRESS, VENTURED TO COMMUNICATE
HER HOPES.  MRS. JENNINGS, THOUGH FORCED, ON EXAMINATION,
TO ACKNOWLEDGE A TEMPORARY REVIVAL, TRIED TO KEEP HER
YOUNG FRIEND FROM INDULGING A THOUGHT OF ITS CONTINUANCE;--
AND ELINOR, CONNING OVER EVERY INJUNCTION OF DISTRUST,
TOLD HERSELF LIKEWISE NOT TO HOPE.  BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.
HOPE HAD ALREADY ENTERED; AND FEELING ALL ITS ANXIOUS FLUTTER,
SHE BENT OVER HER SISTER TO WATCH--SHE HARDLY KNEW FOR WHAT.
HALF AN HOUR PASSED AWAY, AND THE FAVOURABLE SYMPTOM
YET BLESSED HER.  OTHERS EVEN AROSE TO CONFIRM IT.
HER BREATH, HER SKIN, HER LIPS, ALL FLATTERED ELINOR
WITH SIGNS OF AMENDMENT; AND MARIANNE FIXED HER EYES ON
HER WITH A RATIONAL, THOUGH LANGUID, GAZE.  ANXIETY AND
HOPE NOW OPPRESSED HER IN EQUAL DEGREES, AND LEFT HER NO
MOMENT OF TRANQUILLITY TILL THE ARRIVAL OF MR. HARRIS AT
FOUR O'CLOCK;--WHEN HIS ASSURANCES, HIS FELICITATIONS ON
A RECOVERY IN HER SISTER EVEN SURPASSING HIS EXPECTATION,
GAVE HER CONFIDENCE, COMFORT, AND TEARS OF JOY.

MARIANNE WAS IN EVERY RESPECT MATERIALLY BETTER,
AND HE DECLARED HER ENTIRELY OUT OF DANGER.  MRS. JENNINGS,
PERHAPS SATISFIED WITH THE PARTIAL JUSTIFICATION OF HER
FOREBODINGS WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND IN THEIR LATE ALARM,
ALLOWED HERSELF TO TRUST IN HIS JUDGMENT, AND ADMITTED,
WITH UNFEIGNED JOY, AND SOON WITH UNEQUIVOCAL CHEERFULNESS,
THE PROBABILITY OF AN ENTIRE RECOVERY.

ELINOR COULD NOT BE CHEERFUL.  HER JOY WAS OF A
DIFFERENT KIND, AND LED TO ANY THING RATHER THAN TO GAIETY.
MARIANNE RESTORED TO LIFE, HEALTH, FRIENDS, AND TO HER
DOTING MOTHER, WAS AN IDEA TO FILL HER HEART WITH SENSATIONS
OF EXQUISITE COMFORT, AND EXPAND IT IN FERVENT GRATITUDE;--
BUT IT LEAD TO NO OUTWARD DEMONSTRATIONS OF JOY, NO WORDS,
NO SMILES.  ALL WITHIN ELINOR'S BREAST WAS SATISFACTION,
SILENT AND STRONG.

SHE CONTINUED BY THE SIDE OF HER SISTER, WITH LITTLE
INTERMISSION THE WHOLE AFTERNOON, CALMING EVERY FEAR,
SATISFYING EVERY INQUIRY OF HER ENFEEBLED SPIRITS,
SUPPLYING EVERY SUCCOUR, AND WATCHING ALMOST EVERY LOOK AND
EVERY BREATH.  THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELAPSE WOULD OF COURSE,
IN SOME MOMENTS, OCCUR TO REMIND HER OF WHAT ANXIETY WAS--
BUT WHEN SHE SAW, ON HER FREQUENT AND MINUTE EXAMINATION,
THAT EVERY SYMPTOM OF RECOVERY CONTINUED, AND SAW MARIANNE
AT SIX O'CLOCK SINK INTO A QUIET, STEADY, AND TO ALL
APPEARANCE COMFORTABLE, SLEEP, SHE SILENCED EVERY DOUBT.

THE TIME WAS NOW DRAWING ON, WHEN COLONEL BRANDON
MIGHT BE EXPECTED BACK.  AT TEN O'CLOCK, SHE TRUSTED,
OR AT LEAST NOT MUCH LATER HER MOTHER WOULD BE RELIEVED
FROM THE DREADFUL SUSPENSE IN WHICH SHE MUST NOW BE
TRAVELLING TOWARDS THEM.  THE COLONEL, TOO!--PERHAPS SCARCELY
LESS AN OBJECT OF PITY!--OH!--HOW SLOW WAS THE PROGRESS
OF TIME WHICH YET KEPT THEM IN IGNORANCE!

AT SEVEN O'CLOCK, LEAVING MARIANNE STILL SWEETLY ASLEEP,
SHE JOINED MRS. JENNINGS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM TO TEA.
OF BREAKFAST SHE HAD BEEN KEPT BY HER FEARS, AND OF
DINNER BY THEIR SUDDEN REVERSE, FROM EATING MUCH;--
AND THE PRESENT REFRESHMENT, THEREFORE, WITH SUCH FEELINGS
OF CONTENT AS SHE BROUGHT TO IT, WAS PARTICULARLY WELCOME.
MRS. JENNINGS WOULD HAVE PERSUADED HER, AT ITS CONCLUSION,
TO TAKE SOME REST BEFORE HER MOTHER'S ARRIVAL, AND ALLOW HER TO
TAKE HER PLACE BY MARIANNE; BUT ELINOR HAD NO SENSE OF FATIGUE,
NO CAPABILITY OF SLEEP AT THAT MOMENT ABOUT HER, AND SHE WAS
NOT TO BE KEPT AWAY FROM HER SISTER AN UNNECESSARY INSTANT.
MRS. JENNINGS THEREFORE ATTENDING HER UP STAIRS INTO THE
SICK CHAMBER, TO SATISFY HERSELF THAT ALL CONTINUED RIGHT,
LEFT HER THERE AGAIN TO HER CHARGE AND HER THOUGHTS,
AND RETIRED TO HER OWN ROOM TO WRITE LETTERS AND SLEEP.

THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND STORMY.  THE WIND ROARED
ROUND THE HOUSE, AND THE RAIN BEAT AGAINST THE WINDOWS;
BUT ELINOR, ALL HAPPINESS WITHIN, REGARDED IT NOT.
MARIANNE SLEPT THROUGH EVERY BLAST; AND THE TRAVELLERS--
THEY HAD A RICH REWARD IN STORE, FOR EVERY PRESENT INCONVENIENCE.

THE CLOCK STRUCK EIGHT.  HAD IT BEEN TEN,
ELINOR WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT AT THAT MOMENT
SHE HEARD A CARRIAGE DRIVING UP TO THE HOUSE;
AND SO STRONG WAS THE PERSUASION THAT SHE DID, IN SPITE
OF THE ALMOST IMPOSSIBILITY OF THEIR BEING ALREADY COME,
THAT SHE MOVED INTO THE ADJOINING DRESSING-CLOSET AND
OPENED A WINDOW SHUTTER, TO BE SATISFIED OF THE TRUTH.
SHE INSTANTLY SAW THAT HER EARS HAD NOT DECEIVED HER.
THE FLARING LAMPS OF A CARRIAGE WERE IMMEDIATELY IN VIEW.
BY THEIR UNCERTAIN LIGHT SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD DISCERN IT
TO BE DRAWN BY FOUR HORSES; AND THIS, WHILE IT TOLD THE
EXCESS OF HER POOR MOTHER'S ALARM, GAVE SOME EXPLANATION
TO SUCH UNEXPECTED RAPIDITY.

NEVER IN HER LIFE HAD ELINOR FOUND IT SO DIFFICULT
TO BE CALM, AS AT THAT MOMENT.  THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HER
MOTHER MUST BE FEELING AS THE CARRIAGE STOPT AT THE DOOR--
OF HER DOUBT--HER DREAD--PERHAPS HER DESPAIR!--AND
OF WHAT SHE HAD TO TELL!--WITH SUCH KNOWLEDGE IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CALM.  ALL THAT REMAINED TO BE DONE
WAS TO BE SPEEDY; AND, THEREFORE STAYING ONLY TILL
SHE COULD LEAVE MRS. JENNINGS'S MAID WITH HER SISTER,
SHE HURRIED DOWN STAIRS.

THE BUSTLE IN THE VESTIBULE, AS SHE PASSED ALONG
AN INNER LOBBY, ASSURED HER THAT THEY WERE ALREADY
IN THE HOUSE.  SHE RUSHED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM,--SHE
ENTERED IT,--AND SAW ONLY WILLOUGHBY.



CHAPTER 44


ELINOR, STARTING BACK WITH A LOOK OF HORROR AT
THE SIGHT OF HIM, OBEYED THE FIRST IMPULSE OF HER HEART
IN TURNING INSTANTLY TO QUIT THE ROOM, AND HER HAND
WAS ALREADY ON THE LOCK, WHEN ITS ACTION WAS SUSPENDED
BY HIS HASTILY ADVANCING, AND SAYING, IN A VOICE RATHER
OF COMMAND THAN SUPPLICATION,

"MISS DASHWOOD, FOR HALF AN HOUR--FOR TEN MINUTES--
I ENTREAT YOU TO STAY."

"NO, SIR," SHE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS, "I SHALL NOT STAY.
YOUR BUSINESS CANNOT BE WITH ME.  THE SERVANTS, I SUPPOSE,
FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT MR. PALMER WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE."

"HAD THEY TOLD ME," HE CRIED WITH VEHEMENCE,
"THAT MR. PALMER AND ALL HIS RELATIONS WERE AT THE DEVIL,
IT WOULD NOT HAVE TURNED ME FROM THE DOOR.  MY BUSINESS
IS WITH YOU, AND ONLY YOU."

"WITH ME!"--IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT--"WELL, SIR,--
BE QUICK--AND IF YOU CAN--LESS VIOLENT."

"SIT DOWN, AND I WILL BE BOTH."

SHE HESITATED; SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO.  THE POSSIBILITY
OF COLONEL BRANDON'S ARRIVING AND FINDING HER THERE,
CAME ACROSS HER.  BUT SHE HAD PROMISED TO HEAR HIM,
AND HER CURIOSITY NO LESS THAN HER HONOR WAS ENGAGED.
AFTER A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION, THEREFORE, CONCLUDING THAT
PRUDENCE REQUIRED DISPATCH, AND THAT HER ACQUIESCENCE WOULD
BEST PROMOTE IT, SHE WALKED SILENTLY TOWARDS THE TABLE,
AND SAT DOWN.  HE TOOK THE OPPOSITE CHAIR, AND FOR HALF
A MINUTE NOT A WORD WAS SAID BY EITHER.

"PRAY BE QUICK, SIR,"--SAID ELINOR, IMPATIENTLY;--
"I HAVE NO TIME TO SPARE."

HE WAS SITTING IN AN ATTITUDE OF DEEP MEDITATION,
AND SEEMED NOT TO HEAR HER.

"YOUR SISTER," SAID HE, WITH ABRUPTNESS, A MOMENT
AFTERWARDS--"IS OUT OF DANGER.  I HEARD IT FROM THE SERVANT.
GOD BE PRAISED!--BUT IS IT TRUE? IS IT REALLY TRUE?"

ELINOR WOULD NOT SPEAK.  HE REPEATED THE INQUIRY WITH
YET GREATER EAGERNESS.

"FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME, IS SHE OUT OF DANGER, OR IS SHE NOT?"

"WE HOPE SHE IS."

HE ROSE UP, AND WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM.

"HAD I KNOWN AS MUCH HALF AN HOUR AGO--BUT
SINCE I AM HERE,"--SPEAKING WITH A FORCED VIVACITY AS HE
RETURNED TO HIS SEAT--"WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY?--FOR ONCE,
MISS DASHWOOD--IT WILL BE THE LAST TIME, PERHAPS--LET US
BE CHEERFUL TOGETHER.--I AM IN A FINE MOOD FOR GAIETY.--
TELL ME HONESTLY"--A DEEPER GLOW OVERSPREADING HIS CHEEKS--
"DO YOU THINK ME MOST A KNAVE OR A FOOL?"

ELINOR LOOKED AT HIM WITH GREATER ASTONISHMENT THAN EVER.
SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT BE MUST BE IN LIQUOR;--THE
STRANGENESS OF SUCH A VISIT, AND OF SUCH MANNERS,
SEEMED NO OTHERWISE INTELLIGIBLE; AND WITH THIS IMPRESSION
SHE IMMEDIATELY ROSE, SAYING,

"MR. WILLOUGHBY, I ADVISE YOU AT PRESENT TO RETURN
TO COMBE--I AM NOT AT LEISURE TO REMAIN WITH YOU LONGER.--
WHATEVER YOUR BUSINESS MAY BE WITH ME, WILL IT BE BETTER
RECOLLECTED AND EXPLAINED TO-MORROW."

"I UNDERSTAND YOU," HE REPLIED, WITH AN EXPRESSIVE SMILE,
AND A VOICE PERFECTLY CALM; "YES, I AM VERY DRUNK.--
A PINT OF PORTER WITH MY COLD BEEF AT MARLBOROUGH WAS
ENOUGH TO OVER-SET ME."

"AT MARLBOROUGH!"--CRIED ELINOR, MORE AND MORE AT
A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WOULD BE AT.

"YES,--I LEFT LONDON THIS MORNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK,
AND THE ONLY TEN MINUTES I HAVE SPENT OUT OF MY CHAISE
SINCE THAT TIME PROCURED ME A NUNCHEON AT MARLBOROUGH."

THE STEADINESS OF HIS MANNER, AND THE INTELLIGENCE
OF HIS EYE AS HE SPOKE, CONVINCING ELINOR, THAT WHATEVER
OTHER UNPARDONABLE FOLLY MIGHT BRING HIM TO CLEVELAND,
HE WAS NOT BROUGHT THERE BY INTOXICATION, SHE SAID,
AFTER A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION,

"MR. WILLOUGHBY, YOU OUGHT TO FEEL, AND I CERTAINLY
DO--THAT AFTER WHAT HAS PASSED--YOUR COMING HERE IN
THIS MANNER, AND FORCING YOURSELF UPON MY NOTICE,
REQUIRES A VERY PARTICULAR EXCUSE.--WHAT IS IT,
THAT YOU MEAN BY IT?"--

"I MEAN,"--SAID HE, WITH SERIOUS ENERGY--"IF I CAN,
TO MAKE YOU HATE ME ONE DEGREE LESS THAN YOU DO NOW.
I MEAN TO OFFER SOME KIND OF EXPLANATION, SOME KIND
OF APOLOGY, FOR THE PAST; TO OPEN MY WHOLE HEART TO YOU,
AND BY CONVINCING YOU, THAT THOUGH I HAVE BEEN ALWAYS
A BLOCKHEAD, I HAVE NOT BEEN ALWAYS A RASCAL, TO OBTAIN
SOMETHING LIKE FORGIVENESS FROM MA--FROM YOUR SISTER."

"IS THIS THE REAL REASON OF YOUR COMING?"

"UPON MY SOUL IT IS,"--WAS HIS ANSWER, WITH A WARMTH
WHICH BROUGHT ALL THE FORMER WILLOUGHBY TO HER REMEMBRANCE,
AND IN SPITE OF HERSELF MADE HER THINK HIM SINCERE.

"IF THAT IS ALL, YOU MAY BE SATISFIED ALREADY,--
FOR MARIANNE DOES--SHE HAS LONG FORGIVEN YOU."

"HAS SHE?"--HE CRIED, IN THE SAME EAGER TONE.--
"THEN SHE HAS FORGIVEN ME BEFORE SHE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE IT.
BUT SHE SHALL FORGIVE ME AGAIN, AND ON MORE REASONABLE
GROUNDS.--NOW WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME?"

ELINOR BOWED HER ASSENT.

"I DO NOT KNOW," SAID HE, AFTER A PAUSE OF EXPECTATION
ON HER SIDE, AND THOUGHTFULNESS ON HIS OWN,--"HOW YOU
MAY HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MY BEHAVIOUR TO YOUR SISTER,
OR WHAT DIABOLICAL MOTIVE YOU MAY HAVE IMPUTED TO ME.--
PERHAPS YOU WILL HARDLY THINK THE BETTER OF ME,--IT IS
WORTH THE TRIAL HOWEVER, AND YOU SHALL HEAR EVERY THING.
WHEN I FIRST BECAME INTIMATE IN YOUR FAMILY, I HAD NO
OTHER INTENTION, NO OTHER VIEW IN THE ACQUAINTANCE
THAN TO PASS MY TIME PLEASANTLY WHILE I WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN
IN DEVONSHIRE, MORE PLEASANTLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE.
YOUR SISTER'S LOVELY PERSON AND INTERESTING MANNERS
COULD NOT BUT PLEASE ME; AND HER BEHAVIOUR TO ME ALMOST
FROM THE FIRST, WAS OF A KIND--IT IS ASTONISHING,
WHEN I REFLECT ON WHAT IT WAS, AND WHAT SHE WAS, THAT MY
HEART SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO INSENSIBLE!  BUT AT FIRST
I MUST CONFESS, MY VANITY ONLY WAS ELEVATED BY IT.
CARELESS OF HER HAPPINESS, THINKING ONLY OF MY OWN AMUSEMENT,
GIVING WAY TO FEELINGS WHICH I HAD ALWAYS BEEN TOO MUCH
IN THE HABIT OF INDULGING, I ENDEAVOURED, BY EVERY MEANS
IN MY POWER, TO MAKE MYSELF PLEASING TO HER, WITHOUT ANY
DESIGN OF RETURNING HER AFFECTION."

MISS DASHWOOD, AT THIS POINT, TURNING HER EYES ON HIM
WITH THE MOST ANGRY CONTEMPT, STOPPED HIM, BY SAYING,

"IT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE, MR. WILLOUGHBY,
FOR YOU TO RELATE, OR FOR ME TO LISTEN ANY LONGER.
SUCH A BEGINNING AS THIS CANNOT BE FOLLOWED BY ANY THING.--
DO NOT LET ME BE PAINED BY HEARING ANY THING MORE ON
THE SUBJECT."

"I INSIST ON YOU HEARING THE WHOLE OF IT," HE REPLIED,
"MY FORTUNE WAS NEVER LARGE, AND I HAD ALWAYS BEEN EXPENSIVE,
ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF ASSOCIATING WITH PEOPLE OF BETTER
INCOME THAN MYSELF.  EVERY YEAR SINCE MY COMING OF AGE,
OR EVEN BEFORE, I BELIEVE, HAD ADDED TO MY DEBTS; AND THOUGH
THE DEATH OF MY OLD COUSIN, MRS. SMITH, WAS TO SET ME FREE;
YET THAT EVENT BEING UNCERTAIN, AND POSSIBLY FAR DISTANT,
IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME MY INTENTION TO RE-ESTABLISH MY
CIRCUMSTANCES BY MARRYING A WOMAN OF FORTUNE.  TO ATTACH
MYSELF TO YOUR SISTER, THEREFORE, WAS NOT A THING TO BE
THOUGHT OF;--AND WITH A MEANNESS, SELFISHNESS, CRUELTY--
WHICH NO INDIGNANT, NO CONTEMPTUOUS LOOK, EVEN OF YOURS,
MISS DASHWOOD, CAN EVER REPROBATE TOO MUCH--I WAS ACTING
IN THIS MANNER, TRYING TO ENGAGE HER REGARD, WITHOUT A
THOUGHT OF RETURNING IT.--BUT ONE THING MAY BE SAID
FOR ME: EVEN IN THAT HORRID STATE OF SELFISH VANITY,
I DID NOT KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE INJURY I MEDITATED,
BECAUSE I DID NOT THEN KNOW WHAT IT WAS TO LOVE.
BUT HAVE I EVER KNOWN IT?--WELL MAY IT BE DOUBTED; FOR, HAD I
REALLY LOVED, COULD I HAVE SACRIFICED MY FEELINGS TO VANITY,
TO AVARICE?--OR, WHAT IS MORE, COULD I HAVE SACRIFICED HERS?--
BUT I HAVE DONE IT.  TO AVOID A COMPARATIVE POVERTY,
WHICH HER AFFECTION AND HER SOCIETY WOULD HAVE DEPRIVED
OF ALL ITS HORRORS, I HAVE, BY RAISING MYSELF TO AFFLUENCE,
LOST EVERY THING THAT COULD MAKE IT A BLESSING."

"YOU DID THEN," SAID ELINOR, A LITTLE SOFTENED,
"BELIEVE YOURSELF AT ONE TIME ATTACHED TO HER?"

"TO HAVE RESISTED SUCH ATTRACTIONS, TO HAVE WITHSTOOD
SUCH TENDERNESS!--IS THERE A MAN ON EARTH WHO COULD HAVE
DONE IT?--YES, I FOUND MYSELF, BY INSENSIBLE DEGREES,
SINCERELY FOND OF HER; AND THE HAPPIEST HOURS OF MY LIFE
WERE WHAT I SPENT WITH HER WHEN I FELT MY INTENTIONS
WERE STRICTLY HONOURABLE, AND MY FEELINGS BLAMELESS.
EVEN THEN, HOWEVER, WHEN FULLY DETERMINED ON PAYING
MY ADDRESSES TO HER, I ALLOWED MYSELF MOST IMPROPERLY
TO PUT OFF, FROM DAY TO DAY, THE MOMENT OF DOING IT,
FROM AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO AN ENGAGEMENT
WHILE MY CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SO GREATLY EMBARRASSED.
I WILL NOT REASON HERE--NOR WILL I STOP FOR YOU TO EXPATIATE
ON THE ABSURDITY, AND THE WORSE THAN ABSURDITY, OF SCRUPLING
TO ENGAGE MY FAITH WHERE MY HONOUR WAS ALREADY BOUND.
THE EVENT HAS PROVED, THAT I WAS A CUNNING FOOL,
PROVIDING WITH GREAT CIRCUMSPECTION FOR A POSSIBLE
OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING MYSELF CONTEMPTIBLE AND WRETCHED
FOR EVER.  AT LAST, HOWEVER, MY RESOLUTION WAS TAKEN,
AND I HAD DETERMINED, AS SOON AS I COULD ENGAGE HER ALONE,
TO JUSTIFY THE ATTENTIONS I HAD SO INVARIABLY PAID HER,
AND OPENLY ASSURE HER OF AN AFFECTION WHICH I HAD ALREADY
TAKEN SUCH PAINS TO DISPLAY.  BUT IN THE INTERIM--IN THE
INTERIM OF THE VERY FEW HOURS THAT WERE TO PASS, BEFORE I
COULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING WITH HER IN PRIVATE--
A CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED--AN UNLUCKY CIRCUMSTANCE, TO RUIN
ALL MY RESOLUTION, AND WITH IT ALL MY COMFORT.  A DISCOVERY
TOOK PLACE,"--HERE HE HESITATED AND LOOKED DOWN.--"MRS. SMITH
HAD SOMEHOW OR OTHER BEEN INFORMED, I IMAGINE BY SOME
DISTANT RELATION, WHOSE INTEREST IT WAS TO DEPRIVE ME OF
HER FAVOUR, OF AN AFFAIR, A CONNECTION--BUT I NEED NOT
EXPLAIN MYSELF FARTHER," HE ADDED, LOOKING AT HER WITH AN
HEIGHTENED COLOUR AND AN ENQUIRING EYE--"YOUR PARTICULAR
INTIMACY--YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THE WHOLE STORY LONG AGO."

"I HAVE," RETURNED ELINOR, COLOURING LIKEWISE,
AND HARDENING HER HEART ANEW AGAINST ANY COMPASSION FOR HIM,
"I HAVE HEARD IT ALL.  AND HOW YOU WILL EXPLAIN AWAY ANY
PART OF YOUR GUILT IN THAT DREADFUL BUSINESS, I CONFESS
IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION."

"REMEMBER," CRIED WILLOUGHBY, "FROM WHOM YOU RECEIVED
THE ACCOUNT.  COULD IT BE AN IMPARTIAL ONE?  I ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT HER SITUATION AND HER CHARACTER OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
RESPECTED BY ME.  I DO NOT MEAN TO JUSTIFY MYSELF, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME CANNOT LEAVE YOU TO SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE NOTHING
TO URGE--THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS INJURED SHE WAS IRREPROACHABLE,
AND BECAUSE I WAS A LIBERTINE, SHE MUST BE A SAINT.
IF THE VIOLENCE OF HER PASSIONS, THE WEAKNESS OF HER
UNDERSTANDING--I DO NOT MEAN, HOWEVER, TO DEFEND MYSELF.
HER AFFECTION FOR ME DESERVED BETTER TREATMENT, AND I OFTEN,
WITH GREAT SELF-REPROACH, RECALL THE TENDERNESS WHICH,
FOR A VERY SHORT TIME, HAD THE POWER OF CREATING ANY RETURN.
I WISH--I HEARTILY WISH IT HAD NEVER BEEN.  BUT I HAVE INJURED
MORE THAN HERSELF; AND I HAVE INJURED ONE, WHOSE AFFECTION
FOR ME--(MAY I SAY IT?) WAS SCARCELY LESS WARM THAN HERS;
AND WHOSE MIND--OH! HOW INFINITELY SUPERIOR!"--

"YOUR INDIFFERENCE, HOWEVER, TOWARDS THAT UNFORTUNATE
GIRL--I MUST SAY IT, UNPLEASANT TO ME AS THE DISCUSSION
OF SUCH A SUBJECT MAY WELL BE--YOUR INDIFFERENCE IS NO
APOLOGY FOR YOUR CRUEL NEGLECT OF HER.  DO NOT THINK YOURSELF
EXCUSED BY ANY WEAKNESS, ANY NATURAL DEFECT OF UNDERSTANDING
ON HER SIDE, IN THE WANTON CRUELTY SO EVIDENT ON YOURS.
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN, THAT WHILE YOU WERE ENJOYING YOURSELF
IN DEVONSHIRE PURSUING FRESH SCHEMES, ALWAYS GAY,
ALWAYS HAPPY, SHE WAS REDUCED TO THE EXTREMEST INDIGENCE."

"BUT, UPON MY SOUL, I DID NOT KNOW IT," HE WARMLY
REPLIED; "I DID NOT RECOLLECT THAT I HAD OMITTED TO GIVE
HER MY DIRECTION; AND COMMON SENSE MIGHT HAVE TOLD HER
HOW TO FIND IT OUT."

"WELL, SIR, AND WHAT SAID MRS. SMITH?"

"SHE TAXED ME WITH THE OFFENCE AT ONCE, AND MY CONFUSION
MAY BE GUESSED.  THE PURITY OF HER LIFE, THE FORMALITY
OF HER NOTIONS, HER IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD--EVERY THING
WAS AGAINST ME.  THE MATTER ITSELF I COULD NOT DENY,
AND VAIN WAS EVERY ENDEAVOUR TO SOFTEN IT.  SHE WAS
PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED, I BELIEVE, TO DOUBT THE MORALITY OF MY
CONDUCT IN GENERAL, AND WAS MOREOVER DISCONTENTED WITH
THE VERY LITTLE ATTENTION, THE VERY LITTLE PORTION OF MY
TIME THAT I HAD BESTOWED ON HER, IN MY PRESENT VISIT.
IN SHORT, IT ENDED IN A TOTAL BREACH.  BY ONE MEASURE I
MIGHT HAVE SAVED MYSELF.  IN THE HEIGHT OF HER MORALITY,
GOOD WOMAN! SHE OFFERED TO FORGIVE THE PAST, IF I WOULD
MARRY ELIZA.  THAT COULD NOT BE--AND I WAS FORMALLY
DISMISSED FROM HER FAVOUR AND HER HOUSE.  THE NIGHT
FOLLOWING THIS AFFAIR--I WAS TO GO THE NEXT MORNING--
WAS SPENT BY ME IN DELIBERATING ON WHAT MY FUTURE CONDUCT
SHOULD BE.  THE STRUGGLE WAS GREAT--BUT IT ENDED TOO SOON.
MY AFFECTION FOR MARIANNE, MY THOROUGH CONVICTION OF HER
ATTACHMENT TO ME--IT WAS ALL INSUFFICIENT TO OUTWEIGH
THAT DREAD OF POVERTY, OR GET THE BETTER OF THOSE FALSE
IDEAS OF THE NECESSITY OF RICHES, WHICH I WAS NATURALLY
INCLINED TO FEEL, AND EXPENSIVE SOCIETY HAD INCREASED.
I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE MYSELF SECURE OF MY PRESENT WIFE,
IF I CHOSE TO ADDRESS HER, AND I PERSUADED MYSELF TO THINK
THAT NOTHING ELSE IN COMMON PRUDENCE REMAINED FOR ME TO DO.
A HEAVY SCENE HOWEVER AWAITED ME, BEFORE I COULD LEAVE
DEVONSHIRE;--I WAS ENGAGED TO DINE WITH YOU ON THAT VERY DAY;
SOME APOLOGY WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY FOR MY BREAKING
THIS ENGAGEMENT.  BUT WHETHER I SHOULD WRITE THIS APOLOGY,
OR DELIVER IT IN PERSON, WAS A POINT OF LONG DEBATE.
TO SEE MARIANNE, I FELT, WOULD BE DREADFUL, AND I EVEN DOUBTED
WHETHER I COULD SEE HER AGAIN, AND KEEP TO MY RESOLUTION.
IN THAT POINT, HOWEVER, I UNDERVALUED MY OWN MAGNANIMITY,
AS THE EVENT DECLARED; FOR I WENT, I SAW HER, AND SAW
HER MISERABLE, AND LEFT HER MISERABLE--AND LEFT HER HOPING
NEVER TO SEE HER AGAIN."

"WHY DID YOU CALL, MR. WILLOUGHBY?" SAID ELINOR,
REPROACHFULLY; "A NOTE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED EVERY PURPOSE.--
WHY WAS IT NECESSARY TO CALL?"

"IT WAS NECESSARY TO MY OWN PRIDE.  I COULD NOT BEAR
TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN A MANNER THAT MIGHT LEAD YOU,
OR THE REST OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, TO SUSPECT ANY PART
OF WHAT HAD REALLY PASSED BETWEEN MRS. SMITH AND MYSELF--
AND I RESOLVED THEREFORE ON CALLING AT THE COTTAGE,
IN MY WAY TO HONITON.  THE SIGHT OF YOUR DEAR SISTER,
HOWEVER, WAS REALLY DREADFUL; AND, TO HEIGHTEN THE MATTER,
I FOUND HER ALONE.  YOU WERE ALL GONE I DO NOT KNOW WHERE.
I HAD LEFT HER ONLY THE EVENING BEFORE, SO FULLY,
SO FIRMLY RESOLVED WITHIN MY SELF ON DOING RIGHT!
A FEW HOURS WERE TO HAVE ENGAGED HER TO ME FOR EVER;
AND I REMEMBER HOW HAPPY, HOW GAY WERE MY SPIRITS, AS I
WALKED FROM THE COTTAGE TO ALLENHAM, SATISFIED WITH MYSELF,
DELIGHTED WITH EVERY BODY!  BUT IN THIS, OUR LAST INTERVIEW
OF FRIENDSHIP, I APPROACHED HER WITH A SENSE OF GUILT
THAT ALMOST TOOK FROM ME THE POWER OF DISSEMBLING.
HER SORROW, HER DISAPPOINTMENT, HER DEEP REGRET, WHEN I TOLD
HER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE DEVONSHIRE SO IMMEDIATELY--I
NEVER SHALL FORGET IT--UNITED TOO WITH SUCH RELIANCE,
SUCH CONFIDENCE IN ME!--OH, GOD!--WHAT A HARD-HEARTED
RASCAL I WAS!"

THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS.
ELINOR FIRST SPOKE.

"DID YOU TELL HER THAT YOU SHOULD SOON RETURN?"

"I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I TOLD HER," HE REPLIED, IMPATIENTLY;
"LESS THAN WAS DUE TO THE PAST, BEYOND A DOUBT, AND IN ALL
LIKELIHOOD MUCH MORE THAN WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE FUTURE.
I CANNOT THINK OF IT.--IT WON'T DO.--THEN CAME YOUR DEAR MOTHER
TO TORTURE ME FARTHER, WITH ALL HER KINDNESS AND CONFIDENCE.
THANK HEAVEN! IT DID TORTURE ME.  I WAS MISERABLE.
MISS DASHWOOD, YOU CANNOT HAVE AN IDEA OF THE COMFORT IT
GIVES ME TO LOOK BACK ON MY OWN MISERY.  I OWE SUCH A GRUDGE
TO MYSELF FOR THE STUPID, RASCALLY FOLLY OF MY OWN HEART,
THAT ALL MY PAST SUFFERINGS UNDER IT ARE ONLY TRIUMPH AND
EXULTATION TO ME NOW.  WELL, I WENT, LEFT ALL THAT I LOVED,
AND WENT TO THOSE TO WHOM, AT BEST, I WAS ONLY INDIFFERENT.
MY JOURNEY TO TOWN--TRAVELLING WITH MY OWN HORSES,
AND THEREFORE SO TEDIOUSLY--NO CREATURE TO SPEAK TO--MY
OWN REFLECTIONS SO CHEERFUL--WHEN I LOOKED FORWARD
EVERY THING SO INVITING!--WHEN I LOOKED BACK AT BARTON,
THE PICTURE SO SOOTHING!--OH, IT WAS A BLESSED JOURNEY!"

HE STOPPED.

"WELL, SIR," SAID ELINOR, WHO, THOUGH PITYING HIM,
GREW IMPATIENT FOR HIS DEPARTURE, "AND THIS IS ALL?"

"AH!--NO,--HAVE YOU FORGOT WHAT PASSED IN TOWN?--
THAT INFAMOUS LETTER--DID SHE SHEW IT YOU?"

"YES, I SAW EVERY NOTE THAT PASSED."

"WHEN THE FIRST OF HERS REACHED ME (AS IT IMMEDIATELY DID,
FOR I WAS IN TOWN THE WHOLE TIME,) WHAT I FELT IS--
IN THE COMMON PHRASE, NOT TO BE EXPRESSED; IN A MORE
SIMPLE ONE--PERHAPS TOO SIMPLE TO RAISE ANY EMOTION--
MY FEELINGS WERE VERY, VERY PAINFUL.--EVERY LINE, EVERY WORD
WAS--IN THE HACKNEYED METAPHOR WHICH THEIR DEAR WRITER,
WERE SHE HERE, WOULD FORBID--A DAGGER TO MY HEART.
TO KNOW THAT MARIANNE WAS IN TOWN WAS--IN THE SAME LANGUAGE--
A THUNDERBOLT.--THUNDERBOLTS AND DAGGERS!--WHAT A REPROOF
WOULD SHE HAVE GIVEN ME!--HER TASTE, HER OPINIONS--I BELIEVE
THEY ARE BETTER KNOWN TO ME THAN MY OWN,--AND I AM SURE
THEY ARE DEARER."

ELINOR'S HEART, WHICH HAD UNDERGONE MANY CHANGES
IN THE COURSE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY CONVERSATION,
WAS NOW SOFTENED AGAIN;--YET SHE FELT IT HER DUTY TO CHECK
SUCH IDEAS IN HER COMPANION AS THE LAST.

"THIS IS NOT RIGHT, MR. WILLOUGHBY.--REMEMBER THAT
YOU ARE MARRIED.  RELATE ONLY WHAT IN YOUR CONSCIENCE
YOU THINK NECESSARY FOR ME TO HEAR."

"MARIANNE'S NOTE, BY ASSURING ME THAT I WAS STILL
AS DEAR TO HER AS IN FORMER DAYS, THAT IN SPITE OF THE MANY,
MANY WEEKS WE HAD BEEN SEPARATED, SHE WAS AS CONSTANT
IN HER OWN FEELINGS, AND AS FULL OF FAITH IN THE CONSTANCY
OF MINE AS EVER, AWAKENED ALL MY REMORSE.  I SAY AWAKENED,
BECAUSE TIME AND LONDON, BUSINESS AND DISSIPATION,
HAD IN SOME MEASURE QUIETED IT, AND I HAD BEEN GROWING
A FINE HARDENED VILLAIN, FANCYING MYSELF INDIFFERENT TO HER,
AND CHUSING TO FANCY THAT SHE TOO MUST HAVE BECOME
INDIFFERENT TO ME; TALKING TO MYSELF OF OUR PAST ATTACHMENT
AS A MERE IDLE, TRIFLING BUSINESS, SHRUGGING UP MY SHOULDERS
IN PROOF OF ITS BEING SO, AND SILENCING EVERY REPROACH,
OVERCOMING EVERY SCRUPLE, BY SECRETLY SAYING NOW AND THEN,
'I SHALL BE HEARTILY GLAD TO HEAR SHE IS WELL MARRIED.'--
BUT THIS NOTE MADE ME KNOW MYSELF BETTER.  I FELT THAT
SHE WAS INFINITELY DEARER TO ME THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN
IN THE WORLD, AND THAT I WAS USING HER INFAMOUSLY.
BUT EVERY THING WAS THEN JUST SETTLED BETWEEN MISS GREY
AND ME.  TO RETREAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  ALL THAT I HAD TO DO,
WAS TO AVOID YOU BOTH.  I SENT NO ANSWER TO MARIANNE,
INTENDING BY THAT TO PRESERVE MYSELF FROM HER FARTHER NOTICE;
AND FOR SOME TIME I WAS EVEN DETERMINED NOT TO CALL IN
BERKELEY STREET;--BUT AT LAST, JUDGING IT WISER TO AFFECT
THE AIR OF A COOL, COMMON ACQUAINTANCE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,
I WATCHED YOU ALL SAFELY OUT OF THE HOUSE ONE MORNING,
AND LEFT MY NAME."

"WATCHED US OUT OF THE HOUSE!"

"EVEN SO.  YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO HEAR HOW OFTEN
I WATCHED YOU, HOW OFTEN I WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING
IN WITH YOU.  I HAVE ENTERED MANY A SHOP TO AVOID YOUR SIGHT,
AS THE CARRIAGE DROVE BY.  LODGING AS I DID IN BOND STREET,
THERE WAS HARDLY A DAY IN WHICH I DID NOT CATCH A GLIMPSE
OF ONE OR OTHER OF YOU; AND NOTHING BUT THE MOST CONSTANT
WATCHFULNESS ON MY SIDE, A MOST INVARIABLY PREVAILING
DESIRE TO KEEP OUT OF YOUR SIGHT, COULD HAVE SEPARATED US
SO LONG.  I AVOIDED THE MIDDLETONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE,
AS WELL AS EVERYBODY ELSE WHO WAS LIKELY TO PROVE
AN ACQUAINTANCE IN COMMON.  NOT AWARE OF THEIR BEING
IN TOWN, HOWEVER, I BLUNDERED ON SIR JOHN, I BELIEVE,
THE FIRST DAY OF HIS COMING, AND THE DAY AFTER I HAD CALLED
AT MRS. JENNINGS'S.  HE ASKED ME TO A PARTY, A DANCE AT HIS
HOUSE IN THE EVENING.--HAD HE NOT TOLD ME AS AN INDUCEMENT
THAT YOU AND YOUR SISTER WERE TO BE THERE, I SHOULD HAVE
FELT IT TOO CERTAIN A THING, TO TRUST MYSELF NEAR HIM.
THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT ANOTHER SHORT NOTE FROM MARIANNE--
STILL AFFECTIONATE, OPEN, ARTLESS, CONFIDING--EVERYTHING
THAT COULD MAKE MY CONDUCT MOST HATEFUL.  I COULD NOT
ANSWER IT.  I TRIED--BUT COULD NOT FRAME A SENTENCE.
BUT I THOUGHT OF HER, I BELIEVE, EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY.
IF YOU CAN PITY ME, MISS DASHWOOD, PITY MY SITUATION AS IT
WAS THEN.  WITH MY HEAD AND HEART FULL OF YOUR SISTER,
I WAS FORCED TO PLAY THE HAPPY LOVER TO ANOTHER WOMAN!--THOSE
THREE OR FOUR WEEKS WERE WORSE THAN ALL.  WELL, AT LAST,
AS I NEED NOT TELL YOU, YOU WERE FORCED ON ME; AND WHAT A
SWEET FIGURE I CUT!--WHAT AN EVENING OF AGONY IT WAS!--
MARIANNE, BEAUTIFUL AS AN ANGEL ON ONE SIDE, CALLING ME
WILLOUGHBY IN SUCH A TONE!--OH, GOD!--HOLDING OUT HER HAND
TO ME, ASKING ME FOR AN EXPLANATION, WITH THOSE BEWITCHING
EYES FIXED IN SUCH SPEAKING SOLICITUDE ON MY FACE!--AND
SOPHIA, JEALOUS AS THE DEVIL ON THE OTHER HAND, LOOKING
ALL THAT WAS--WELL, IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY; IT IS OVER NOW.--
SUCH AN EVENING!--I RAN AWAY FROM YOU ALL AS SOON AS I COULD;
BUT NOT BEFORE I HAD SEEN MARIANNE'S SWEET FACE AS WHITE
AS DEATH.--THAT WAS THE LAST, LAST LOOK I EVER HAD OF HER;--
THE LAST MANNER IN WHICH SHE APPEARED TO ME.  IT WAS A HORRID
SIGHT!--YET WHEN I THOUGHT OF HER TO-DAY AS REALLY DYING,
IT WAS A KIND OF COMFORT TO ME TO IMAGINE THAT I KNEW
EXACTLY HOW SHE WOULD APPEAR TO THOSE, WHO SAW HER LAST
IN THIS WORLD.  SHE WAS BEFORE ME, CONSTANTLY BEFORE ME,
AS I TRAVELLED, IN THE SAME LOOK AND HUE."

A SHORT PAUSE OF MUTUAL THOUGHTFULNESS SUCCEEDED.
WILLOUGHBY FIRST ROUSING HIMSELF, BROKE IT THUS:

"WELL, LET ME MAKE HASTE AND BE GONE.  YOUR SISTER
IS CERTAINLY BETTER, CERTAINLY OUT OF DANGER?"

"WE ARE ASSURED OF IT."

"YOUR POOR MOTHER, TOO!--DOTING ON MARIANNE."

"BUT THE LETTER, MR. WILLOUGHBY, YOUR OWN LETTER;
HAVE YOU ANY THING TO SAY ABOUT THAT?"

"YES, YES, THAT IN PARTICULAR.  YOUR SISTER
WROTE TO ME AGAIN, YOU KNOW, THE VERY NEXT MORNING.
YOU SAW WHAT SHE SAID.  I WAS BREAKFASTING AT THE
ELLISONS,--AND HER LETTER, WITH SOME OTHERS, WAS BROUGHT
TO ME THERE FROM MY LODGINGS.  IT HAPPENED TO CATCH
SOPHIA'S EYE BEFORE IT CAUGHT MINE--AND ITS SIZE,
THE ELEGANCE OF THE PAPER, THE HAND-WRITING ALTOGETHER,
IMMEDIATELY GAVE HER A SUSPICION.  SOME VAGUE REPORT HAD
REACHED HER BEFORE OF MY ATTACHMENT TO SOME YOUNG LADY
IN DEVONSHIRE, AND WHAT HAD PASSED WITHIN HER OBSERVATION
THE PRECEDING EVENING HAD MARKED WHO THE YOUNG LADY WAS,
AND MADE HER MORE JEALOUS THAN EVER.  AFFECTING THAT AIR
OF PLAYFULNESS, THEREFORE, WHICH IS DELIGHTFUL IN A WOMAN
ONE LOVES, SHE OPENED THE LETTER DIRECTLY, AND READ
ITS CONTENTS.  SHE WAS WELL PAID FOR HER IMPUDENCE.
SHE READ WHAT MADE HER WRETCHED.  HER WRETCHEDNESS I COULD
HAVE BORNE, BUT HER PASSION--HER MALICE--AT ALL EVENTS IT
MUST BE APPEASED.  AND, IN SHORT--WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY
WIFE'S STYLE OF LETTER-WRITING?--DELICATE--TENDER--
TRULY FEMININE--WAS IT NOT?"

"YOUR WIFE!--THE LETTER WAS IN YOUR OWN HAND-WRITING."

"YES, BUT I HAD ONLY THE CREDIT OF SERVILELY COPYING
SUCH SENTENCES AS I WAS ASHAMED TO PUT MY NAME TO.
THE ORIGINAL WAS ALL HER OWN--HER OWN HAPPY THOUGHTS
AND GENTLE DICTION.  BUT WHAT COULD I DO!--WE WERE ENGAGED,
EVERY THING IN PREPARATION, THE DAY ALMOST FIXED--BUT I AM
TALKING LIKE A FOOL.  PREPARATION!--DAY!--IN HONEST WORDS,
HER MONEY WAS NECESSARY TO ME, AND IN A SITUATION LIKE
MINE, ANY THING WAS TO BE DONE TO PREVENT A RUPTURE.
AND AFTER ALL, WHAT DID IT SIGNIFY TO MY CHARACTER
IN THE OPINION OF MARIANNE AND HER FRIENDS, IN WHAT LANGUAGE
MY ANSWER WAS COUCHED?--IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONLY TO ONE END.
MY BUSINESS WAS TO DECLARE MYSELF A SCOUNDREL, AND WHETHER
I DID IT WITH A BOW OR A BLUSTER WAS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE.--
'I AM RUINED FOR EVER IN THEIR OPINION--' SAID I TO
MYSELF--'I AM SHUT OUT FOR EVER FROM THEIR SOCIETY,
THEY ALREADY THINK ME AN UNPRINCIPLED FELLOW, THIS LETTER
WILL ONLY MAKE THEM THINK ME A BLACKGUARD ONE.' SUCH WERE
MY REASONINGS, AS, IN A SORT OF DESPERATE CARELESSNESS,
I COPIED MY WIFE'S WORDS, AND PARTED WITH THE LAST RELICS
OF MARIANNE.  HER THREE NOTES--UNLUCKILY THEY WERE ALL
IN MY POCKETBOOK, OR I SHOULD HAVE DENIED THEIR EXISTENCE,
AND HOARDED THEM FOR EVER--I WAS FORCED TO PUT THEM UP,
AND COULD NOT EVEN KISS THEM.  AND THE LOCK OF HAIR--THAT TOO
I HAD ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT ME IN THE SAME POCKET-BOOK,
WHICH WAS NOW SEARCHED BY MADAM WITH THE MOST INGRATIATING
VIRULENCE,--THE DEAR LOCK--ALL, EVERY MEMENTO WAS TORN FROM ME."

"YOU ARE VERY WRONG, MR. WILLOUGHBY, VERY BLAMABLE,"
SAID ELINOR, WHILE HER VOICE, IN SPITE OF HERSELF,
BETRAYED HER COMPASSIONATE EMOTION; "YOU OUGHT NOT TO SPEAK
IN THIS WAY, EITHER OF MRS. WILLOUGHBY OR MY SISTER.
YOU HAD MADE YOUR OWN CHOICE.  IT WAS NOT FORCED ON YOU.
YOUR WIFE HAS A CLAIM TO YOUR POLITENESS, TO YOUR RESPECT,
AT LEAST.  SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO YOU, OR SHE WOULD NOT
HAVE MARRIED YOU.  TO TREAT HER WITH UNKINDNESS, TO SPEAK
OF HER SLIGHTINGLY IS NO ATONEMENT TO MARIANNE--NOR CAN I
SUPPOSE IT A RELIEF TO YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE."

"DO NOT TALK TO ME OF MY WIFE," SAID HE WITH A HEAVY SIGH.--
"SHE DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR COMPASSION.--SHE KNEW I HAD NO
REGARD FOR HER WHEN WE MARRIED.--WELL, MARRIED WE WERE,
AND CAME DOWN TO COMBE MAGNA TO BE HAPPY, AND AFTERWARDS
RETURNED TO TOWN TO BE GAY.--AND NOW DO YOU PITY ME,
MISS DASHWOOD?--OR HAVE I SAID ALL THIS TO NO PURPOSE?--
AM I--BE IT ONLY ONE DEGREE--AM I LESS GUILTY IN YOUR OPINION
THAN I WAS BEFORE?--MY INTENTIONS WERE NOT ALWAYS WRONG.
HAVE I EXPLAINED AWAY ANY PART OF MY GUILT?"

"YES, YOU HAVE CERTAINLY REMOVED SOMETHING--A LITTLE.--
YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF, ON THE WHOLE, LESS FAULTY THAN
I HAD BELIEVED YOU.  YOU HAVE PROVED YOUR HEART LESS WICKED,
MUCH LESS WICKED.  BUT I HARDLY KNOW--THE MISERY THAT
YOU HAVE INFLICTED--I HARDLY KNOW WHAT COULD HAVE MADE
IT WORSE."

"WILL YOU REPEAT TO YOUR SISTER WHEN SHE IS RECOVERED,
WHAT I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU?--LET ME BE A LITTLE LIGHTENED
TOO IN HER OPINION AS WELL AS IN YOURS.  YOU TELL ME THAT
SHE HAS FORGIVEN ME ALREADY.  LET ME BE ABLE TO FANCY THAT
A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF MY HEART, AND OF MY PRESENT FEELINGS,
WILL DRAW FROM HER A MORE SPONTANEOUS, MORE NATURAL, MORE
GENTLE, LESS DIGNIFIED, FORGIVENESS.  TELL HER OF MY MISERY
AND MY PENITENCE--TELL HER THAT MY HEART WAS NEVER INCONSTANT
TO HER, AND IF YOU WILL, THAT AT THIS MOMENT SHE IS DEARER
TO ME THAN EVER."

"I WILL TELL HER ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO WHAT MAY
COMPARATIVELY BE CALLED, YOUR JUSTIFICATION.  BUT YOU HAVE
NOT EXPLAINED TO ME THE PARTICULAR REASON OF YOUR COMING NOW,
NOR HOW YOU HEARD OF HER ILLNESS."

"LAST NIGHT, IN DRURY LANE LOBBY, I RAN AGAINST SIR
JOHN MIDDLETON, AND WHEN HE SAW WHO I WAS--FOR THE FIRST
TIME THESE TWO MONTHS--HE SPOKE TO ME.--THAT HE HAD CUT
ME EVER SINCE MY MARRIAGE, I HAD SEEN WITHOUT SURPRISE
OR RESENTMENT.  NOW, HOWEVER, HIS GOOD-NATURED, HONEST,
STUPID SOUL, FULL OF INDIGNATION AGAINST ME, AND CONCERN
FOR YOUR SISTER, COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF TELLING
ME WHAT HE KNEW OUGHT TO--THOUGH PROBABLY HE DID NOT
THINK IT WOULD--VEX ME HORRIDLY.  AS BLUNTLY AS HE COULD
SPEAK IT, THEREFORE, HE TOLD ME THAT MARIANNE DASHWOOD
WAS DYING OF A PUTRID FEVER AT CLEVELAND--A LETTER THAT
MORNING RECEIVED FROM MRS. JENNINGS DECLARED HER DANGER
MOST IMMINENT--THE PALMERS ARE ALL GONE OFF IN A FRIGHT,
&C.--I WAS TOO MUCH SHOCKED TO BE ABLE TO PASS MYSELF
OFF AS INSENSIBLE EVEN TO THE UNDISCERNING SIR JOHN.
HIS HEART WAS SOFTENED IN SEEING MINE SUFFER; AND SO MUCH
OF HIS ILL-WILL WAS DONE AWAY, THAT WHEN WE PARTED,
HE ALMOST SHOOK ME BY THE HAND WHILE HE REMINDED ME OF AN
OLD PROMISE ABOUT A POINTER PUPPY.  WHAT I FELT ON HEARING
THAT YOUR SISTER WAS DYING--AND DYING TOO, BELIEVING ME
THE GREATEST VILLAIN UPON EARTH, SCORNING, HATING ME
IN HER LATEST MOMENTS--FOR HOW COULD I TELL WHAT HORRID
PROJECTS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN IMPUTED?  ONE PERSON I
WAS SURE WOULD REPRESENT ME AS CAPABLE OF ANY THING--
WHAT I FELT WAS DREADFUL!--MY RESOLUTION WAS SOON MADE,
AND AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING I WAS IN MY CARRIAGE.
NOW YOU KNOW ALL."

ELINOR MADE NO ANSWER.  HER THOUGHTS WERE SILENTLY FIXED
ON THE IRREPARABLE INJURY WHICH TOO EARLY AN INDEPENDENCE
AND ITS CONSEQUENT HABITS OF IDLENESS, DISSIPATION, AND LUXURY,
HAD MADE IN THE MIND, THE CHARACTER, THE HAPPINESS,
OF A MAN WHO, TO EVERY ADVANTAGE OF PERSON AND TALENTS,
UNITED A DISPOSITION NATURALLY OPEN AND HONEST, AND A
FEELING, AFFECTIONATE TEMPER.  THE WORLD HAD MADE HIM
EXTRAVAGANT AND VAIN--EXTRAVAGANCE AND VANITY HAD MADE HIM
COLD-HEARTED AND SELFISH.  VANITY, WHILE SEEKING ITS OWN
GUILTY TRIUMPH AT THE EXPENSE OF ANOTHER, HAD INVOLVED
HIM IN A REAL ATTACHMENT, WHICH EXTRAVAGANCE, OR AT LEAST
ITS OFFSPRING, NECESSITY, HAD REQUIRED TO BE SACRIFICED.
EACH FAULTY PROPENSITY IN LEADING HIM TO EVIL, HAD LED
HIM LIKEWISE TO PUNISHMENT.  THE ATTACHMENT, FROM WHICH
AGAINST HONOUR, AGAINST FEELING, AGAINST EVERY BETTER INTEREST
HE HAD OUTWARDLY TORN HIMSELF, NOW, WHEN NO LONGER ALLOWABLE,
GOVERNED EVERY THOUGHT; AND THE CONNECTION, FOR THE SAKE
OF WHICH HE HAD, WITH LITTLE SCRUPLE, LEFT HER SISTER
TO MISERY, WAS LIKELY TO PROVE A SOURCE OF UNHAPPINESS
TO HIMSELF OF A FAR MORE INCURABLE NATURE.  FROM A REVERIE
OF THIS KIND SHE WAS RECALLED AT THE END OF SOME MINUTES
BY WILLOUGHBY, WHO, ROUSING HIMSELF FROM A REVERIE AT LEAST
EQUALLY PAINFUL, STARTED UP IN PREPARATION FOR GOING, AND SAID--

"THERE IS NO USE IN STAYING HERE; I MUST BE OFF."

"ARE YOU GOING BACK TO TOWN?"

"NO--TO COMBE MAGNA.  I HAVE BUSINESS THERE;
FROM THENCE TO TOWN IN A DAY OR TWO.  GOOD BYE."

HE HELD OUT HIS HAND.  SHE COULD NOT REFUSE TO GIVE
HIM HERS'S;--HE PRESSED IT WITH AFFECTION.

"AND YOU DO THINK SOMETHING BETTER OF ME THAN
YOU DID?"--SAID HE, LETTING IT FALL, AND LEANING AGAINST
THE MANTEL-PIECE AS IF FORGETTING HE WAS TO GO.

ELINOR ASSURED HIM THAT SHE DID;--THAT SHE FORGAVE,
PITIED, WISHED HIM WELL--WAS EVEN INTERESTED IN HIS
HAPPINESS--AND ADDED SOME GENTLE COUNSEL AS TO THE BEHAVIOUR
MOST LIKELY TO PROMOTE IT.  HIS ANSWER WAS NOT VERY ENCOURAGING.

"AS TO THAT," SAID HE, "I MUST RUB THROUGH THE WORLD
AS WELL AS I CAN.  DOMESTIC HAPPINESS IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.
IF, HOWEVER, I AM ALLOWED TO THINK THAT YOU AND YOURS FEEL
AN INTEREST IN MY FATE AND ACTIONS, IT MAY BE THE MEANS--IT
MAY PUT ME ON MY GUARD--AT LEAST, IT MAY BE SOMETHING TO
LIVE FOR.  MARIANNE TO BE SURE IS LOST TO ME FOR EVER.
WERE I EVEN BY ANY BLESSED CHANCE AT LIBERTY AGAIN--"

ELINOR STOPPED HIM WITH A REPROOF.

"WELL,"--HE REPLIED--"ONCE MORE GOOD BYE. I SHALL
NOW GO AWAY AND LIVE IN DREAD OF ONE EVENT."

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

"YOUR SISTER'S MARRIAGE."

"YOU ARE VERY WRONG.  SHE CAN NEVER BE MORE LOST
TO YOU THAN SHE IS NOW."

"BUT SHE WILL BE GAINED BY SOME ONE ELSE.  AND IF
THAT SOME ONE SHOULD BE THE VERY HE WHOM, OF ALL OTHERS,
I COULD LEAST BEAR--BUT I WILL NOT STAY TO ROB MYSELF
OF ALL YOUR COMPASSIONATE GOODWILL, BY SHEWING
THAT WHERE I HAVE MOST INJURED I CAN LEAST FORGIVE.
GOOD BYE,--GOD BLESS YOU!"

AND WITH THESE WORDS, HE ALMOST RAN OUT OF THE ROOM.



CHAPTER 45


ELINOR, FOR SOME TIME AFTER HE LEFT HER, FOR SOME TIME
EVEN AFTER THE SOUND OF HIS CARRIAGE HAD DIED AWAY, REMAINED
TOO MUCH OPPRESSED BY A CROWD OF IDEAS, WIDELY DIFFERING IN
THEMSELVES, BUT OF WHICH SADNESS WAS THE GENERAL RESULT,
TO THINK EVEN OF HER SISTER.

WILLOUGHBY, HE, WHOM ONLY HALF AN HOUR AGO SHE HAD
ABHORRED AS THE MOST WORTHLESS OF MEN, WILLOUGHBY, IN SPITE
OF ALL HIS FAULTS, EXCITED A DEGREE OF COMMISERATION
FOR THE SUFFERINGS PRODUCED BY THEM, WHICH MADE HER
THINK OF HIM AS NOW SEPARATED FOR EVER FROM HER FAMILY,
WITH A TENDERNESS, A REGRET, RATHER IN PROPORTION, AS SHE
SOON ACKNOWLEDGED WITHIN HERSELF--TO HIS WISHES THAN TO
HIS MERITS.  SHE FELT THAT HIS INFLUENCE OVER HER MIND
WAS HEIGHTENED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH OUGHT NOT IN REASON
TO HAVE WEIGHT; BY THAT PERSON OF UNCOMMON ATTRACTION,
THAT OPEN, AFFECTIONATE, AND LIVELY MANNER WHICH IT
WAS NO MERIT TO POSSESS; AND BY THAT STILL ARDENT LOVE
FOR MARIANNE, WHICH IT WAS NOT EVEN INNOCENT TO INDULGE.
BUT SHE FELT THAT IT WAS SO, LONG, LONG BEFORE SHE COULD
FEEL HIS INFLUENCE LESS.

WHEN AT LAST SHE RETURNED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS MARIANNE,
SHE FOUND HER JUST AWAKING, REFRESHED BY SO LONG AND SWEET
A SLEEP TO THE EXTENT OF HER HOPES.  ELINOR'S HEART WAS FULL.
THE PAST, THE PRESENT, THE FUTURE, WILLOUGHBY'S VISIT,
MARIANNE'S SAFETY, AND HER MOTHER'S EXPECTED ARRIVAL,
THREW HER ALTOGETHER INTO AN AGITATION OF SPIRITS
WHICH KEPT OFF EVERY INDICATION OF FATIGUE, AND MADE
HER ONLY FEARFUL OF BETRAYING HERSELF TO HER SISTER.
SHORT WAS THE TIME, HOWEVER, IN WHICH THAT FEAR COULD
AFFECT HER, FOR WITHIN HALF AN HOUR AFTER WILLOUGHBY'S
LEAVING THE HOUSE, SHE WAS AGAIN CALLED DOWN STAIRS
BY THE SOUND OF ANOTHER CARRIAGE.--EAGER TO SAVE HER
MOTHER FROM EVERY UNNECESSARY MOMENT'S HORRIBLE SUSPENSE,
SHE RAN IMMEDIATELY INTO THE HALL, AND REACHED THE OUTWARD
DOOR JUST IN TIME TO RECEIVE AND SUPPORT HER AS SHE ENTERED IT.

MRS. DASHWOOD, WHOSE TERROR AS THEY DREW NEAR THE
HOUSE HAD PRODUCED ALMOST THE CONVICTION OF MARIANNE'S
BEING NO MORE, HAD NO VOICE TO INQUIRE AFTER HER,
NO VOICE EVEN FOR ELINOR; BUT SHE, WAITING NEITHER FOR
SALUTATION NOR INQUIRY, INSTANTLY GAVE THE JOYFUL RELIEF;--
AND HER MOTHER, CATCHING IT WITH ALL HER USUAL WARMTH,
WAS IN A MOMENT AS MUCH OVERCOME BY HER HAPPINESS, AS SHE
HAD BEEN BEFORE BY HER FEARS.  SHE WAS SUPPORTED INTO
THE DRAWING-ROOM BETWEEN HER DAUGHTER AND HER FRIEND;--
AND THERE, SHEDDING TEARS OF JOY, THOUGH STILL UNABLE
TO SPEAK, EMBRACED ELINOR AGAIN AND AGAIN, TURNING FROM HER
AT INTERVALS TO PRESS COLONEL BRANDON'S HAND, WITH A LOOK
WHICH SPOKE AT ONCE HER GRATITUDE, AND HER CONVICTION
OF HIS SHARING WITH HERSELF IN THE BLISS OF THE MOMENT.
HE SHARED IT, HOWEVER, IN A SILENCE EVEN GREATER THAN HER OWN.

AS SOON AS MRS. DASHWOOD HAD RECOVERED HERSELF,
TO SEE MARIANNE WAS HER FIRST DESIRE; AND IN TWO MINUTES SHE
WAS WITH HER BELOVED CHILD, RENDERED DEARER TO HER THAN EVER
BY ABSENCE, UNHAPPINESS, AND DANGER.  ELINOR'S DELIGHT,
AS SHE SAW WHAT EACH FELT IN THE MEETING, WAS ONLY CHECKED
BY AN APPREHENSION OF ITS ROBBING MARIANNE OF FARTHER SLEEP;--
BUT MRS. DASHWOOD COULD BE CALM, COULD BE EVEN PRUDENT,
WHEN THE LIFE OF A CHILD WAS AT STAKE, AND MARIANNE,
SATISFIED IN KNOWING HER MOTHER WAS NEAR HER, AND CONSCIOUS
OF BEING TOO WEAK FOR CONVERSATION, SUBMITTED READILY TO THE
SILENCE AND QUIET PRESCRIBED BY EVERY NURSE AROUND HER.
MRS. DASHWOOD WOULD SIT UP WITH HER ALL NIGHT; AND ELINOR,
IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER MOTHER'S ENTREATY, WENT TO BED.
BUT THE REST, WHICH ONE NIGHT ENTIRELY SLEEPLESS,
AND MANY HOURS OF THE MOST WEARING ANXIETY SEEMED TO
MAKE REQUISITE, WAS KEPT OFF BY IRRITATION OF SPIRITS.
WILLOUGHBY, "POOR WILLOUGHBY," AS SHE NOW ALLOWED
HERSELF TO CALL HIM, WAS CONSTANTLY IN HER THOUGHTS; SHE
WOULD NOT BUT HAVE HEARD HIS VINDICATION FOR THE WORLD,
AND NOW BLAMED, NOW ACQUITTED HERSELF FOR HAVING JUDGED HIM
SO HARSHLY BEFORE.  BUT HER PROMISE OF RELATING IT TO HER
SISTER WAS INVARIABLY PAINFUL.  SHE DREADED THE PERFORMANCE
OF IT, DREADED WHAT ITS EFFECT ON MARIANNE MIGHT BE;
DOUBTED WHETHER AFTER SUCH AN EXPLANATION SHE COULD EVER
BE HAPPY WITH ANOTHER; AND FOR A MOMENT WISHED WILLOUGHBY
A WIDOWER.  THEN, REMEMBERING COLONEL BRANDON, REPROVED HERSELF,
FELT THAT TO HIS SUFFERINGS AND HIS CONSTANCY FAR MORE
THAN TO HIS RIVAL'S, THE REWARD OF HER SISTER WAS DUE,
AND WISHED ANY THING RATHER THAN MRS. WILLOUGHBY'S DEATH.

THE SHOCK OF COLONEL BRANDON'S ERRAND AT BARTON HAD BEEN
MUCH SOFTENED TO MRS. DASHWOOD BY HER OWN PREVIOUS ALARM;
FOR SO GREAT WAS HER UNEASINESS ABOUT MARIANNE, THAT SHE
HAD ALREADY DETERMINED TO SET OUT FOR CLEVELAND ON THAT
VERY DAY, WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY FURTHER INTELLIGENCE,
AND HAD SO FAR SETTLED HER JOURNEY BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL,
THAT THE CAREYS WERE THEN EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT TO FETCH
MARGARET AWAY, AS HER MOTHER WAS UNWILLING TO TAKE HER
WHERE THERE MIGHT BE INFECTION.

MARIANNE CONTINUED TO MEND EVERY DAY, AND THE BRILLIANT
CHEERFULNESS OF MRS. DASHWOOD'S LOOKS AND SPIRITS PROVED
HER TO BE, AS SHE REPEATEDLY DECLARED HERSELF, ONE OF
THE HAPPIEST WOMEN IN THE WORLD.  ELINOR COULD NOT HEAR
THE DECLARATION, NOR WITNESS ITS PROOFS WITHOUT SOMETIMES
WONDERING WHETHER HER MOTHER EVER RECOLLECTED EDWARD.
BUT MRS. DASHWOOD, TRUSTING TO THE TEMPERATE ACCOUNT
OF HER OWN DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH ELINOR HAD SENT HER,
WAS LED AWAY BY THE EXUBERANCE OF HER JOY TO THINK ONLY
OF WHAT WOULD INCREASE IT.  MARIANNE WAS RESTORED TO HER
FROM A DANGER IN WHICH, AS SHE NOW BEGAN TO FEEL,
HER OWN MISTAKEN JUDGMENT IN ENCOURAGING THE UNFORTUNATE
ATTACHMENT TO WILLOUGHBY, HAD CONTRIBUTED TO PLACE HER;--
AND IN HER RECOVERY SHE HAD YET ANOTHER SOURCE OF JOY
UNTHOUGHT OF BY ELINOR.  IT WAS THUS IMPARTED TO HER,
AS SOON AS ANY OPPORTUNITY OF PRIVATE CONFERENCE
BETWEEN THEM OCCURRED.

"AT LAST WE ARE ALONE.  MY ELINOR, YOU DO NOT YET
KNOW ALL MY HAPPINESS.  COLONEL BRANDON LOVES MARIANNE.
HE HAS TOLD ME SO HIMSELF."

HER DAUGHTER, FEELING BY TURNS BOTH PLEASED AND PAINED,
SURPRISED AND NOT SURPRISED, WAS ALL SILENT ATTENTION.

"YOU ARE NEVER LIKE ME, DEAR ELINOR, OR I SHOULD
WONDER AT YOUR COMPOSURE NOW.  HAD I SAT DOWN TO WISH
FOR ANY POSSIBLE GOOD TO MY FAMILY, I SHOULD HAVE FIXED
ON COLONEL BRANDON'S MARRYING ONE OF YOU AS THE OBJECT
MOST DESIRABLE.  AND I BELIEVE MARIANNE WILL BE THE MOST
HAPPY WITH HIM OF THE TWO."

ELINOR WAS HALF INCLINED TO ASK HER REASON FOR THINKING SO,
BECAUSE SATISFIED THAT NONE FOUNDED ON AN IMPARTIAL
CONSIDERATION OF THEIR AGE, CHARACTERS, OR FEELINGS,
COULD BE GIVEN;--BUT HER MOTHER MUST ALWAYS BE CARRIED
AWAY BY HER IMAGINATION ON ANY INTERESTING SUBJECT,
AND THEREFORE INSTEAD OF AN INQUIRY, SHE PASSED IT OFF WITH A
SMILE.

"HE OPENED HIS WHOLE HEART TO ME YESTERDAY AS WE TRAVELLED.
IT CAME OUT QUITE UNAWARES, QUITE UNDESIGNEDLY.  I, YOU MAY
WELL BELIEVE, COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT MY CHILD;--HE COULD
NOT CONCEAL HIS DISTRESS; I SAW THAT IT EQUALLED MY OWN,
AND HE PERHAPS, THINKING THAT MERE FRIENDSHIP, AS THE WORLD
NOW GOES, WOULD NOT JUSTIFY SO WARM A SYMPATHY--OR RATHER,
NOT THINKING AT ALL, I SUPPOSE--GIVING WAY TO IRRESISTIBLE
FEELINGS, MADE ME ACQUAINTED WITH HIS EARNEST, TENDER, CONSTANT,
AFFECTION FOR MARIANNE.  HE HAS LOVED HER, MY ELINOR, EVER SINCE
THE FIRST MOMENT OF SEEING HER."

HERE, HOWEVER, ELINOR PERCEIVED,--NOT THE LANGUAGE,
NOT THE PROFESSIONS OF COLONEL BRANDON, BUT THE NATURAL
EMBELLISHMENTS OF HER MOTHER'S ACTIVE FANCY, WHICH FASHIONED
EVERY THING DELIGHTFUL TO HER AS IT CHOSE.

"HIS REGARD FOR HER, INFINITELY SURPASSING ANYTHING
THAT WILLOUGHBY EVER FELT OR FEIGNED, AS MUCH MORE WARM,
AS MORE SINCERE OR CONSTANT--WHICH EVER WE ARE TO CALL IT--
HAS SUBSISTED THROUGH ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF DEAR MARIANNE'S
UNHAPPY PREPOSSESSION FOR THAT WORTHLESS YOUNG MAN!--AND
WITHOUT SELFISHNESS--WITHOUT ENCOURAGING A HOPE!--COULD
HE HAVE SEEN HER HAPPY WITH ANOTHER--SUCH A NOBLE MIND!--
SUCH OPENNESS, SUCH SINCERITY!--NO ONE CAN BE DECEIVED
IN HIM."

"COLONEL BRANDON'S CHARACTER," SAID ELINOR,
"AS AN EXCELLENT MAN, IS WELL ESTABLISHED."

"I KNOW IT IS"--REPLIED HER MOTHER SERIOUSLY, "OR
AFTER SUCH A WARNING, I SHOULD BE THE LAST TO ENCOURAGE
SUCH AFFECTION, OR EVEN TO BE PLEASED BY IT.  BUT HIS COMING
FOR ME AS HE DID, WITH SUCH ACTIVE, SUCH READY FRIENDSHIP,
IS ENOUGH TO PROVE HIM ONE OF THE WORTHIEST OF MEN."

"HIS CHARACTER, HOWEVER," ANSWERED ELINOR, "DOES NOT REST
ON ONE ACT OF KINDNESS, TO WHICH HIS AFFECTION FOR MARIANNE,
WERE HUMANITY OUT OF THE CASE, WOULD HAVE PROMPTED HIM.
TO MRS. JENNINGS, TO THE MIDDLETONS, HE HAS BEEN LONG
AND INTIMATELY KNOWN; THEY EQUALLY LOVE AND RESPECT HIM;
AND EVEN MY OWN KNOWLEDGE OF HIM, THOUGH LATELY ACQUIRED,
IS VERY CONSIDERABLE; AND SO HIGHLY DO I VALUE AND ESTEEM HIM,
THAT IF MARIANNE CAN BE HAPPY WITH HIM, I SHALL BE AS READY
AS YOURSELF TO THINK OUR CONNECTION THE GREATEST BLESSING
TO US IN THE WORLD.  WHAT ANSWER DID YOU GIVE HIM?--DID YOU
ALLOW HIM TO HOPE?"

"OH! MY LOVE, I COULD NOT THEN TALK OF HOPE TO HIM
OR TO MYSELF.  MARIANNE MIGHT AT THAT MOMENT BE DYING.
BUT HE DID NOT ASK FOR HOPE OR ENCOURAGEMENT.  HIS WAS
AN INVOLUNTARY CONFIDENCE, AN IRREPRESSIBLE EFFUSION
TO A SOOTHING FRIEND--NOT AN APPLICATION TO A PARENT.
YET AFTER A TIME I DID SAY, FOR AT FIRST I WAS QUITE
OVERCOME--THAT IF SHE LIVED, AS I TRUSTED SHE MIGHT,
MY GREATEST HAPPINESS WOULD LIE IN PROMOTING THEIR MARRIAGE;
AND SINCE OUR ARRIVAL, SINCE OUR DELIGHTFUL SECURITY,
I HAVE REPEATED IT TO HIM MORE FULLY, HAVE GIVEN HIM EVERY
ENCOURAGEMENT IN MY POWER.  TIME, A VERY LITTLE TIME,
I TELL HIM, WILL DO EVERYTHING;--MARIANNE'S HEART IS
NOT TO BE WASTED FOR EVER ON SUCH A MAN AS WILLOUGHBY.--
HIS OWN MERITS MUST SOON SECURE IT."

"TO JUDGE FROM THE COLONEL'S SPIRITS, HOWEVER,
YOU HAVE NOT YET MADE HIM EQUALLY SANGUINE."

"NO.--HE THINKS MARIANNE'S AFFECTION TOO DEEPLY
ROOTED FOR ANY CHANGE IN IT UNDER A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME,
AND EVEN SUPPOSING HER HEART AGAIN FREE, IS TOO DIFFIDENT
OF HIMSELF TO BELIEVE, THAT WITH SUCH A DIFFERENCE OF AGE
AND DISPOSITION HE COULD EVER ATTACH HER.  THERE, HOWEVER,
HE IS QUITE MISTAKEN.  HIS AGE IS ONLY SO MUCH BEYOND
HERS AS TO BE AN ADVANTAGE, AS TO MAKE HIS CHARACTER AND
PRINCIPLES FIXED;--AND HIS DISPOSITION, I AM WELL CONVINCED,
IS EXACTLY THE VERY ONE TO MAKE YOUR SISTER HAPPY.
AND HIS PERSON, HIS MANNERS TOO, ARE ALL IN HIS FAVOUR.
MY PARTIALITY DOES NOT BLIND ME; HE CERTAINLY IS NOT
SO HANDSOME AS WILLOUGHBY--BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
THERE IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE PLEASING IN HIS COUNTENANCE.--
THERE WAS ALWAYS A SOMETHING,--IF YOU REMEMBER,--IN WILLOUGHBY'S
EYES AT TIMES, WHICH I DID NOT LIKE."

ELINOR COULD NOT REMEMBER IT;--BUT HER MOTHER,
WITHOUT WAITING FOR HER ASSENT, CONTINUED,

"AND HIS MANNERS, THE COLONEL'S MANNERS ARE NOT ONLY
MORE PLEASING TO ME THAN WILLOUGHBY'S EVER WERE, BUT THEY
ARE OF A KIND I WELL KNOW TO BE MORE SOLIDLY ATTACHING
TO MARIANNE.  THEIR GENTLENESS, THEIR GENUINE ATTENTION
TO OTHER PEOPLE, AND THEIR MANLY UNSTUDIED SIMPLICITY
IS MUCH MORE ACCORDANT WITH HER REAL DISPOSITION, THAN
THE LIVELINESS--OFTEN ARTIFICIAL, AND OFTEN ILL-TIMED
OF THE OTHER.  I AM VERY SURE MYSELF, THAT HAD WILLOUGHBY
TURNED OUT AS REALLY AMIABLE, AS HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF
THE CONTRARY, MARIANNE WOULD YET NEVER HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY
WITH HIM, AS SHE WILL BE WITH COLONEL BRANDON."

SHE PAUSED.--HER DAUGHTER COULD NOT QUITE AGREE
WITH HER, BUT HER DISSENT WAS NOT HEARD, AND THEREFORE
GAVE NO OFFENCE.

"AT DELAFORD, SHE WILL BE WITHIN AN EASY DISTANCE OF ME,"
ADDED MRS. DASHWOOD, "EVEN IF I REMAIN AT BARTON; AND IN ALL
PROBABILITY,--FOR I HEAR IT IS A LARGE VILLAGE,--INDEED THERE
CERTAINLY MUST BE SOME SMALL HOUSE OR COTTAGE CLOSE BY,
THAT WOULD SUIT US QUITE AS WELL AS OUR PRESENT SITUATION."

POOR ELINOR!--HERE WAS A NEW SCHEME FOR GETTING
HER TO DELAFORD!--BUT HER SPIRIT WAS STUBBORN.

"HIS FORTUNE TOO!--FOR AT MY TIME OF LIFE YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY CARES ABOUT THAT;--AND THOUGH I NEITHER KNOW
NOR DESIRE TO KNOW, WHAT IT REALLY IS, I AM SURE IT MUST BE
A GOOD ONE."

HERE THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTRANCE OF A
THIRD PERSON, AND ELINOR WITHDREW TO THINK IT ALL OVER
IN PRIVATE, TO WISH SUCCESS TO HER FRIEND, AND YET
IN WISHING IT, TO FEEL A PANG FOR WILLOUGHBY.



CHAPTER 46


MARIANNE'S ILLNESS, THOUGH WEAKENING IN ITS KIND,
HAD NOT BEEN LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE HER RECOVERY SLOW;
AND WITH YOUTH, NATURAL STRENGTH, AND HER MOTHER'S PRESENCE
IN AID, IT PROCEEDED SO SMOOTHLY AS TO ENABLE HER TO REMOVE,
WITHIN FOUR DAYS AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE LATTER,
INTO MRS. PALMER'S DRESSING-ROOM.  WHEN THERE, AT HER OWN
PARTICULAR REQUEST, FOR SHE WAS IMPATIENT TO POUR FORTH
HER THANKS TO HIM FOR FETCHING HER MOTHER, COLONEL BRANDON
WAS INVITED TO VISIT HER.

HIS EMOTION ON ENTERING THE ROOM, IN SEEING HER ALTERED
LOOKS, AND IN RECEIVING THE PALE HAND WHICH SHE IMMEDIATELY
HELD OUT TO HIM, WAS SUCH, AS, IN ELINOR'S CONJECTURE,
MUST ARISE FROM SOMETHING MORE THAN HIS AFFECTION FOR MARIANNE,
OR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS BEING KNOWN TO OTHERS;
AND SHE SOON DISCOVERED IN HIS MELANCHOLY EYE AND VARYING
COMPLEXION AS HE LOOKED AT HER SISTER, THE PROBABLE
RECURRENCE OF MANY PAST SCENES OF MISERY TO HIS MIND,
BROUGHT BACK BY THAT RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN MARIANNE AND ELIZA
ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED, AND NOW STRENGTHENED BY THE HOLLOW EYE,
THE SICKLY SKIN, THE POSTURE OF RECLINING WEAKNESS,
AND THE WARM ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PECULIAR OBLIGATION.

MRS. DASHWOOD, NOT LESS WATCHFUL OF WHAT PASSED THAN
HER DAUGHTER, BUT WITH A MIND VERY DIFFERENTLY INFLUENCED,
AND THEREFORE WATCHING TO VERY DIFFERENT EFFECT,
SAW NOTHING IN THE COLONEL'S BEHAVIOUR BUT WHAT AROSE
FROM THE MOST SIMPLE AND SELF-EVIDENT SENSATIONS, WHILE IN
THE ACTIONS AND WORDS OF MARIANNE SHE PERSUADED HERSELF
TO THINK THAT SOMETHING MORE THAN GRATITUDE ALREADY DAWNED.

AT THE END OF ANOTHER DAY OR TWO, MARIANNE GROWING
VISIBLY STRONGER EVERY TWELVE HOURS, MRS. DASHWOOD,
URGED EQUALLY BY HER OWN AND HER DAUGHTER'S WISHES,
BEGAN TO TALK OF REMOVING TO BARTON.  ON HER MEASURES
DEPENDED THOSE OF HER TWO FRIENDS; MRS. JENNINGS COULD
NOT QUIT CLEVELAND DURING THE DASHWOODS' STAY; AND COLONEL
BRANDON WAS SOON BROUGHT, BY THEIR UNITED REQUEST,
TO CONSIDER HIS OWN ABODE THERE AS EQUALLY DETERMINATE,
IF NOT EQUALLY INDISPENSABLE.  AT HIS AND MRS. JENNINGS'S
UNITED REQUEST IN RETURN, MRS. DASHWOOD WAS PREVAILED
ON TO ACCEPT THE USE OF HIS CARRIAGE ON HER JOURNEY BACK,
FOR THE BETTER ACCOMMODATION OF HER SICK CHILD; AND THE COLONEL,
AT THE JOINT INVITATION OF MRS. DASHWOOD AND MRS. JENNINGS,
WHOSE ACTIVE GOOD-NATURE MADE HER FRIENDLY AND HOSPITABLE
FOR OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL AS HERSELF, ENGAGED WITH PLEASURE
TO REDEEM IT BY A VISIT AT THE COTTAGE, IN THE COURSE
OF A FEW WEEKS.

THE DAY OF SEPARATION AND DEPARTURE ARRIVED;
AND MARIANNE, AFTER TAKING SO PARTICULAR AND LENGTHENED
A LEAVE OF MRS. JENNINGS, ONE SO EARNESTLY GRATEFUL, SO FULL
OF RESPECT AND KIND WISHES AS SEEMED DUE TO HER OWN HEART
FROM A SECRET ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PAST INATTENTION, AND BIDDING
COLONEL BRANDON FAREWELL WITH A CORDIALITY OF A FRIEND,
WAS CAREFULLY ASSISTED BY HIM INTO THE CARRIAGE, OF WHICH HE
SEEMED ANXIOUS THAT SHE SHOULD ENGROSS AT LEAST HALF.
MRS. DASHWOOD AND ELINOR THEN FOLLOWED, AND THE OTHERS
WERE LEFT BY THEMSELVES, TO TALK OF THE TRAVELLERS,
AND FEEL THEIR OWN DULLNESS, TILL MRS. JENNINGS WAS SUMMONED
TO HER CHAISE TO TAKE COMFORT IN THE GOSSIP OF HER MAID
FOR THE LOSS OF HER TWO YOUNG COMPANIONS; AND COLONEL BRANDON
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS TOOK HIS SOLITARY WAY TO DELAFORD.

THE DASHWOODS WERE TWO DAYS ON THE ROAD, AND MARIANNE
BORE HER JOURNEY ON BOTH, WITHOUT ESSENTIAL FATIGUE.
EVERY THING THAT THE MOST ZEALOUS AFFECTION, THE MOST
SOLICITOUS CARE COULD DO TO RENDER HER COMFORTABLE,
WAS THE OFFICE OF EACH WATCHFUL COMPANION, AND EACH
FOUND THEIR REWARD IN HER BODILY EASE, AND HER CALMNESS
OF SPIRITS.  TO ELINOR, THE OBSERVATION OF THE LATTER
WAS PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL.  SHE, WHO HAD SEEN HER WEEK
AFTER WEEK SO CONSTANTLY SUFFERING, OPPRESSED BY ANGUISH
OF HEART WHICH SHE HAD NEITHER COURAGE TO SPEAK OF,
NOR FORTITUDE TO CONCEAL, NOW SAW WITH A JOY, WHICH NO OTHER
COULD EQUALLY SHARE, AN APPARENT COMPOSURE OF MIND, WHICH,
IN BEING THE RESULT AS SHE TRUSTED OF SERIOUS REFLECTION,
MUST EVENTUALLY LEAD HER TO CONTENTMENT AND CHEERFULNESS.

AS THEY APPROACHED BARTON, INDEED, AND ENTERED
ON SCENES OF WHICH EVERY FIELD AND EVERY TREE BROUGHT
SOME PECULIAR, SOME PAINFUL RECOLLECTION, SHE GREW SILENT
AND THOUGHTFUL, AND TURNING AWAY HER FACE FROM THEIR NOTICE,
SAT EARNESTLY GAZING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  BUT HERE,
ELINOR COULD NEITHER WONDER NOR BLAME; AND WHEN SHE SAW,
AS SHE ASSISTED MARIANNE FROM THE CARRIAGE, THAT SHE
HAD BEEN CRYING, SHE SAW ONLY AN EMOTION TOO NATURAL
IN ITSELF TO RAISE ANY THING LESS TENDER THAN PITY,
AND IN ITS UNOBTRUSIVENESS ENTITLED TO PRAISE.  IN THE
WHOLE OF HER SUBSEQUENT MANNER, SHE TRACED THE DIRECTION
OF A MIND AWAKENED TO REASONABLE EXERTION; FOR NO SOONER
HAD THEY ENTERED THEIR COMMON SITTING-ROOM, THAN MARIANNE
TURNED HER EYES AROUND IT WITH A LOOK OF RESOLUTE FIRMNESS,
AS IF DETERMINED AT ONCE TO ACCUSTOM HERSELF TO THE SIGHT
OF EVERY OBJECT WITH WHICH THE REMEMBRANCE OF WILLOUGHBY COULD
BE CONNECTED.--SHE SAID LITTLE, BUT EVERY SENTENCE AIMED
AT CHEERFULNESS, AND THOUGH A SIGH SOMETIMES ESCAPED HER,
IT NEVER PASSED AWAY WITHOUT THE ATONEMENT OF A SMILE.
AFTER DINNER SHE WOULD TRY HER PIANO-FORTE. SHE WENT TO IT;
BUT THE MUSIC ON WHICH HER EYE FIRST RESTED WAS AN OPERA,
PROCURED FOR HER BY WILLOUGHBY, CONTAINING SOME OF THEIR
FAVOURITE DUETS, AND BEARING ON ITS OUTWARD LEAF HER OWN NAME
IN HIS HAND-WRITING.--THAT WOULD NOT DO.--SHE SHOOK HER HEAD,
PUT THE MUSIC ASIDE, AND AFTER RUNNING OVER THE KEYS
FOR A MINUTE, COMPLAINED OF FEEBLENESS IN HER FINGERS,
AND CLOSED THE INSTRUMENT AGAIN; DECLARING HOWEVER WITH FIRMNESS
AS SHE DID SO, THAT SHE SHOULD IN FUTURE PRACTICE MUCH.

THE NEXT MORNING PRODUCED NO ABATEMENT IN THESE
HAPPY SYMPTOMS.  ON THE CONTRARY, WITH A MIND AND BODY
ALIKE STRENGTHENED BY REST, SHE LOOKED AND SPOKE WITH
MORE GENUINE SPIRIT, ANTICIPATING THE PLEASURE OF
MARGARET'S RETURN, AND TALKING OF THE DEAR FAMILY PARTY
WHICH WOULD THEN BE RESTORED, OF THEIR MUTUAL PURSUITS
AND CHEERFUL SOCIETY, AS THE ONLY HAPPINESS WORTH A WISH.

"WHEN THE WEATHER IS SETTLED, AND I HAVE RECOVERED
MY STRENGTH," SAID SHE, "WE WILL TAKE LONG WALKS TOGETHER
EVERY DAY.  WE WILL WALK TO THE FARM AT THE EDGE OF THE DOWN,
AND SEE HOW THE CHILDREN GO ON; WE WILL WALK TO SIR JOHN'S
NEW PLANTATIONS AT BARTON CROSS, AND THE ABBEYLAND;
AND WE WILL OFTEN GO THE OLD RUINS OF THE PRIORY,
AND TRY TO TRACE ITS FOUNDATIONS AS FAR AS WE ARE TOLD
THEY ONCE REACHED.  I KNOW WE SHALL BE HAPPY.  I KNOW
THE SUMMER WILL PASS HAPPILY AWAY.  I MEAN NEVER TO BE
LATER IN RISING THAN SIX, AND FROM THAT TIME TILL DINNER
I SHALL DIVIDE EVERY MOMENT BETWEEN MUSIC AND READING.
I HAVE FORMED MY PLAN, AND AM DETERMINED TO ENTER ON A COURSE
OF SERIOUS STUDY.  OUR OWN LIBRARY IS TOO WELL KNOWN TO ME,
TO BE RESORTED TO FOR ANY THING BEYOND MERE AMUSEMENT.
BUT THERE ARE MANY WORKS WELL WORTH READING AT THE PARK;
AND THERE ARE OTHERS OF MORE MODERN PRODUCTION WHICH I
KNOW I CAN BORROW OF COLONEL BRANDON.  BY READING ONLY SIX
HOURS A-DAY, I SHALL GAIN IN THE COURSE OF A TWELVE-MONTH
A GREAT DEAL OF INSTRUCTION WHICH I NOW FEEL MYSELF TO WANT."

ELINOR HONOURED HER FOR A PLAN WHICH ORIGINATED
SO NOBLY AS THIS; THOUGH SMILING TO SEE THE SAME EAGER
FANCY WHICH HAD BEEN LEADING HER TO THE EXTREME OF LANGUID
INDOLENCE AND SELFISH REPINING, NOW AT WORK IN INTRODUCING
EXCESS INTO A SCHEME OF SUCH RATIONAL EMPLOYMENT AND VIRTUOUS
SELF-CONTROL. HER SMILE HOWEVER CHANGED TO A SIGH WHEN SHE
REMEMBERED THAT PROMISE TO WILLOUGHBY WAS YET UNFULFILLED,
AND FEARED SHE HAD THAT TO COMMUNICATE WHICH MIGHT AGAIN
UNSETTLE THE MIND OF MARIANNE, AND RUIN AT LEAST FOR A TIME
THIS FAIR PROSPECT OF BUSY TRANQUILLITY.  WILLING THEREFORE
TO DELAY THE EVIL HOUR, SHE RESOLVED TO WAIT TILL HER
SISTER'S HEALTH WERE MORE SECURE, BEFORE SHE APPOINTED IT.
BUT THE RESOLUTION WAS MADE ONLY TO BE BROKEN.

MARIANNE HAD BEEN TWO OR THREE DAYS AT HOME, BEFORE
THE WEATHER WAS FINE ENOUGH FOR AN INVALID LIKE HERSELF
TO VENTURE OUT.  BUT AT LAST A SOFT, GENIAL MORNING APPEARED;
SUCH AS MIGHT TEMPT THE DAUGHTER'S WISHES AND THE
MOTHER'S CONFIDENCE; AND MARIANNE, LEANING ON ELINOR'S ARM,
WAS AUTHORISED TO WALK AS LONG AS SHE COULD WITHOUT FATIGUE,
IN THE LANE BEFORE THE HOUSE.

THE SISTERS SET OUT AT A PACE, SLOW AS THE FEEBLENESS
OF MARIANNE IN AN EXERCISE HITHERTO UNTRIED SINCE HER
ILLNESS REQUIRED;--AND THEY HAD ADVANCED ONLY SO FAR
BEYOND THE HOUSE AS TO ADMIT A FULL VIEW OF THE HILL,
THE IMPORTANT HILL BEHIND, WHEN PAUSING WITH HER EYES
TURNED TOWARDS IT, MARIANNE CALMLY SAID,

"THERE, EXACTLY THERE,"--POINTING WITH ONE HAND,
"ON THAT PROJECTING MOUND,--THERE I FELL; AND THERE
I FIRST SAW WILLOUGHBY."

HER VOICE SUNK WITH THE WORD, BUT PRESENTLY REVIVING SHE ADDED,

"I AM THANKFUL TO FIND THAT I CAN LOOK WITH SO LITTLE PAIN
ON THE SPOT!--SHALL WE EVER TALK ON THAT SUBJECT, ELINOR?"--
HESITATINGLY IT WAS SAID.--"OR WILL IT BE WRONG?--I CAN TALK
OF IT NOW, I HOPE, AS I OUGHT TO DO."--

ELINOR TENDERLY INVITED HER TO BE OPEN.

"AS FOR REGRET," SAID MARIANNE, "I HAVE DONE WITH THAT,
AS FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED.  I DO NOT MEAN TO TALK TO YOU
OF WHAT MY FEELINGS HAVE BEEN FOR HIM, BUT WHAT THEY
ARE NOW.--AT PRESENT, IF I COULD BE SATISFIED ON ONE POINT,
IF I COULD BE ALLOWED TO THINK THAT HE WAS NOT ALWAYS
ACTING A PART, NOT ALWAYS DECEIVING ME;--BUT ABOVE ALL,
IF I COULD BE ASSURED THAT HE NEVER WAS SO VERY WICKED
AS MY FEARS HAVE SOMETIMES FANCIED HIM, SINCE THE STORY
OF THAT UNFORTUNATE GIRL"--

SHE STOPT.  ELINOR JOYFULLY TREASURED HER WORDS
AS SHE ANSWERED,

"IF YOU COULD BE ASSURED OF THAT, YOU THINK YOU
SHOULD BE EASY."

"YES. MY PEACE OF MIND IS DOUBLY INVOLVED IN IT;--
FOR NOT ONLY IS IT HORRIBLE TO SUSPECT A PERSON, WHO HAS
BEEN WHAT HE HAS BEEN TO ME, OF SUCH DESIGNS,--BUT WHAT MUST
IT MAKE ME APPEAR TO MYSELF?--WHAT IN A SITUATION LIKE MINE,
BUT A MOST SHAMEFULLY UNGUARDED AFFECTION COULD EXPOSE
ME TO"--

"HOW THEN," ASKED HER SISTER, "WOULD YOU ACCOUNT
FOR HIS BEHAVIOUR?"

"I WOULD SUPPOSE HIM,--OH, HOW GLADLY WOULD I SUPPOSE HIM,
ONLY FICKLE, VERY, VERY FICKLE."

ELINOR SAID NO MORE.  SHE WAS DEBATING WITHIN HERSELF
ON THE ELIGIBILITY OF BEGINNING HER STORY DIRECTLY,
OR POSTPONING IT TILL MARIANNE WERE IN STRONGER HEALTH;--
AND THEY CREPT ON FOR A FEW MINUTES IN SILENCE.

"I AM NOT WISHING HIM TOO MUCH GOOD," SAID MARIANNE
AT LAST WITH A SIGH, "WHEN I WISH HIS SECRET REFLECTIONS
MAY BE NO MORE UNPLEASANT THAN MY OWN.  HE WILL SUFFER
ENOUGH IN THEM."

"DO YOU COMPARE YOUR CONDUCT WITH HIS?"

"NO. I COMPARE IT WITH WHAT IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN;
I COMPARE IT WITH YOURS."

"OUR SITUATIONS HAVE BORNE LITTLE RESEMBLANCE."

"THEY HAVE BORNE MORE THAN OUR CONDUCT.--DO NOT,
MY DEAREST ELINOR, LET YOUR KINDNESS DEFEND WHAT I KNOW
YOUR JUDGMENT MUST CENSURE.  MY ILLNESS HAS MADE ME THINK--
IT HAS GIVEN ME LEISURE AND CALMNESS FOR SERIOUS RECOLLECTION.
LONG BEFORE I WAS ENOUGH RECOVERED TO TALK, I WAS PERFECTLY
ABLE TO REFLECT.  I CONSIDERED THE PAST: I SAW IN MY
OWN BEHAVIOUR, SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE
WITH HIM LAST AUTUMN, NOTHING BUT A SERIES OF IMPRUDENCE
TOWARDS MYSELF, AND WANT OF KINDNESS TO OTHERS.
I SAW THAT MY OWN FEELINGS HAD PREPARED MY SUFFERINGS,
AND THAT MY WANT OF FORTITUDE UNDER THEM HAD ALMOST LED
ME TO THE GRAVE.  MY ILLNESS, I WELL KNEW, HAD BEEN
ENTIRELY BROUGHT ON BY MYSELF BY SUCH NEGLIGENCE OF MY
OWN HEALTH, AS I HAD FELT EVEN AT THE TIME TO BE WRONG.
HAD I DIED,--IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SELF-DESTRUCTION. I
DID NOT KNOW MY DANGER TILL THE DANGER WAS REMOVED;
BUT WITH SUCH FEELINGS AS THESE REFLECTIONS GAVE ME,
I WONDER AT MY RECOVERY,--WONDER THAT THE VERY EAGERNESS
OF MY DESIRE TO LIVE, TO HAVE TIME FOR ATONEMENT TO MY GOD,
AND TO YOU ALL, DID NOT KILL ME AT ONCE.  HAD I DIED,--
IN WHAT PECULIAR MISERY SHOULD I HAVE LEFT YOU, MY NURSE,
MY FRIEND, MY SISTER!--YOU, WHO HAD SEEN ALL THE FRETFUL
SELFISHNESS OF MY LATTER DAYS; WHO HAD KNOWN ALL THE
MURMURINGS OF MY HEART!--HOW SHOULD I HAVE LIVED IN YOUR
REMEMBRANCE!--MY MOTHER TOO! HOW COULD YOU HAVE CONSOLED
HER!--I CANNOT EXPRESS MY OWN ABHORRENCE OF MYSELF.
WHENEVER I LOOKED TOWARDS THE PAST, I SAW SOME DUTY NEGLECTED,
OR SOME FAILING INDULGED.  EVERY BODY SEEMED INJURED BY ME.
THE KINDNESS, THE UNCEASING KINDNESS OF MRS. JENNINGS,
I HAD REPAID WITH UNGRATEFUL CONTEMPT.  TO THE MIDDLETONS,
TO THE PALMERS, THE STEELES, TO EVERY COMMON ACQUAINTANCE EVEN,
I HAD BEEN INSOLENT AND UNJUST; WITH A HEART HARDENED
AGAINST THEIR MERITS, AND A TEMPER IRRITATED BY THEIR
VERY ATTENTION.--TO JOHN, TO FANNY,--YES, EVEN TO THEM,
LITTLE AS THEY DESERVE, I HAD GIVEN LESS THAN THEIR DUE.
BUT YOU,--YOU ABOVE ALL, ABOVE MY MOTHER, HAD BEEN WRONGED
BY ME.  I, AND ONLY I, KNEW YOUR HEART AND ITS SORROWS;
YET TO WHAT DID IT INFLUENCE ME?--NOT TO ANY COMPASSION
THAT COULD BENEFIT YOU OR MYSELF.--YOUR EXAMPLE WAS
BEFORE ME; BUT TO WHAT AVAIL?--WAS I MORE CONSIDERATE
OF YOU AND YOUR COMFORT?  DID I IMITATE YOUR FORBEARANCE,
OR LESSEN YOUR RESTRAINTS, BY TAKING ANY PART IN THOSE
OFFICES OF GENERAL COMPLAISANCE OR PARTICULAR GRATITUDE
WHICH YOU HAD HITHERTO BEEN LEFT TO DISCHARGE ALONE?--NO;--
NOT LESS WHEN I KNEW YOU TO BE UNHAPPY, THAN WHEN I
HAD BELIEVED YOU AT EASE, DID I TURN AWAY FROM EVERY
EXERTION OF DUTY OR FRIENDSHIP; SCARCELY ALLOWING SORROW
TO EXIST BUT WITH ME, REGRETTING ONLY THAT HEART
WHICH HAD DESERTED AND WRONGED ME, AND LEAVING YOU,
FOR OR I PROFESSED AN UNBOUNDED AFFECTION, TO BE MISERABLE
FOR MY SAKE."

HERE CEASED THE RAPID FLOW OF HER SELF-REPROVING SPIRIT;
AND ELINOR, IMPATIENT TO SOOTHE, THOUGH TOO HONEST
TO FLATTER, GAVE HER INSTANTLY THAT PRAISE AND SUPPORT
WHICH HER FRANKNESS AND HER CONTRITION SO WELL DESERVED.
MARIANNE PRESSED HER HAND AND REPLIED,

"YOU ARE VERY GOOD.--THE FUTURE MUST BE MY PROOF.
I HAVE LAID DOWN MY PLAN, AND IF I AM CAPABLE OF ADHERING
TO IT--MY FEELINGS SHALL BE GOVERNED AND MY TEMPER IMPROVED.
THEY SHALL NO LONGER WORRY OTHERS, NOR TORTURE MYSELF.
I SHALL NOW LIVE SOLELY FOR MY FAMILY.  YOU, MY MOTHER,
AND MARGARET, MUST HENCEFORTH BE ALL THE WORLD TO ME;
YOU WILL SHARE MY AFFECTIONS ENTIRELY BETWEEN YOU.
>FROM YOU, FROM MY HOME, I SHALL NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE SMALLEST
INCITEMENT TO MOVE; AND IF I DO MIX IN OTHER SOCIETY,
IT WILL BE ONLY TO SHEW THAT MY SPIRIT IS HUMBLED,
MY HEART AMENDED, AND THAT I CAN PRACTISE THE CIVILITIES,
THE LESSER DUTIES OF LIFE, WITH GENTLENESS AND FORBEARANCE.
AS FOR WILLOUGHBY--TO SAY THAT I SHALL SOON OR THAT I SHALL
EVER FORGET HIM, WOULD BE IDLE.  HIS REMEMBRANCE CAN BE OVERCOME
BY NO CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES OR OPINIONS.  BUT IT SHALL
BE REGULATED, IT SHALL BE CHECKED BY RELIGION, BY REASON,
BY CONSTANT EMPLOYMENT."

SHE PAUSED--AND ADDED IN A LOW VOICE, "IF I COULD
BUT KNOW HIS HEART, EVERYTHING WOULD BECOME EASY."

ELINOR, WHO HAD NOW BEEN FOR SOME TIME REFLECTING
ON THE PROPRIETY OR IMPROPRIETY OF SPEEDILY HAZARDING
HER NARRATION, WITHOUT FEELING AT ALL NEARER DECISION THAN
AT FIRST, HEARD THIS; AND PERCEIVING THAT AS REFLECTION
DID NOTHING, RESOLUTION MUST DO ALL, SOON FOUND HERSELF
LEADING TO THE FACT.

SHE MANAGED THE RECITAL, AS SHE HOPED, WITH ADDRESS;
PREPARED HER ANXIOUS LISTENER WITH CAUTION; RELATED SIMPLY
AND HONESTLY THE CHIEF POINTS ON WHICH WILLOUGHBY
GROUNDED HIS APOLOGY; DID JUSTICE TO HIS REPENTANCE,
AND SOFTENED ONLY HIS PROTESTATIONS OF PRESENT REGARD.
MARIANNE SAID NOT A WORD.--SHE TREMBLED, HER EYES
WERE FIXED ON THE GROUND, AND HER LIPS BECAME WHITER
THAN EVEN SICKNESS HAD LEFT THEM.  A THOUSAND INQUIRIES
SPRUNG UP FROM HER HEART, BUT SHE DARED NOT URGE ONE.
SHE CAUGHT EVERY SYLLABLE WITH PANTING EAGERNESS; HER HAND,
UNKNOWINGLY TO HERSELF, CLOSELY PRESSED HER SISTER'S, AND
TEARS COVERED HER CHEEKS.

ELINOR, DREADING HER BEING TIRED, LED HER TOWARDS HOME;
AND TILL THEY REACHED THE DOOR OF THE COTTAGE,
EASILY CONJECTURING WHAT HER CURIOSITY MUST BE
THOUGH NO QUESTION WAS SUFFERED TO SPEAK IT, TALKED OF
NOTHING BUT WILLOUGHBY, AND THEIR CONVERSATION TOGETHER;
AND WAS CAREFULLY MINUTE IN EVERY PARTICULAR OF SPEECH
AND LOOK, WHERE MINUTENESS COULD BE SAFELY INDULGED.
AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE, MARIANNE WITH A KISS
OF GRATITUDE AND THESE TWO WORDS JUST ARTICULATE THROUGH
HER TEARS, "TELL MAMA," WITHDREW FROM HER SISTER AND
WALKED SLOWLY UP STAIRS.  ELINOR WOULD NOT ATTEMPT
TO DISTURB A SOLITUDE SO REASONABLE AS WHAT SHE NOW SOUGHT;
AND WITH A MIND ANXIOUSLY PRE-ARRANGING ITS RESULT,
AND A RESOLUTION OF REVIVING THE SUBJECT AGAIN,
SHOULD MARIANNE FAIL TO DO IT, SHE TURNED INTO THE PARLOUR
TO FULFILL HER PARTING INJUNCTION.



CHAPTER 47


MRS. DASHWOOD DID NOT HEAR UNMOVED THE VINDICATION
OF HER FORMER FAVOURITE.  SHE REJOICED IN HIS BEING
CLEARED FROM SOME PART OF HIS IMPUTED GUILT;--SHE WAS
SORRY FOR HIM;--SHE WISHED HIM HAPPY.  BUT THE FEELINGS
OF THE PAST COULD NOT BE RECALLED.--NOTHING COULD RESTORE
HIM WITH A FAITH UNBROKEN--A CHARACTER UNBLEMISHED,
TO MARIANNE.  NOTHING COULD DO AWAY THE KNOWLEDGE
OF WHAT THE LATTER HAD SUFFERED THROUGH HIS MEANS,
NOR REMOVE THE GUILT OF HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS ELIZA.
NOTHING COULD REPLACE HIM, THEREFORE, IN HER FORMER ESTEEM,
NOR INJURE THE INTERESTS OF COLONEL BRANDON.

HAD MRS. DASHWOOD, LIKE HER DAUGHTER, HEARD WILLOUGHBY'S
STORY FROM HIMSELF--HAD SHE WITNESSED HIS DISTRESS,
AND BEEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIS COUNTENANCE AND HIS
MANNER, IT IS PROBABLE THAT HER COMPASSION WOULD HAVE
BEEN GREATER.  BUT IT WAS NEITHER IN ELINOR'S POWER,
NOR IN HER WISH, TO ROUSE SUCH FEELINGS IN ANOTHER, BY HER
RETAILED EXPLANATION, AS HAD AT FIRST BEEN CALLED FORTH
IN HERSELF.  REFLECTION HAD GIVEN CALMNESS TO HER JUDGMENT,
AND SOBERED HER OWN OPINION OF WILLOUGHBY'S DESERTS;--
SHE WISHED, THEREFORE, TO DECLARE ONLY THE SIMPLE TRUTH,
AND LAY OPEN SUCH FACTS AS WERE REALLY DUE TO HIS CHARACTER,
WITHOUT ANY EMBELLISHMENT OF TENDERNESS TO LEAD THE
FANCY ASTRAY.

IN THE EVENING, WHEN THEY WERE ALL THREE TOGETHER,
MARIANNE BEGAN VOLUNTARILY TO SPEAK OF HIM AGAIN;--
BUT THAT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT AN EFFORT, THE RESTLESS,
UNQUIET THOUGHTFULNESS IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME
PREVIOUSLY SITTING--HER RISING COLOUR, AS SHE SPOKE,--
AND HER UNSTEADY VOICE, PLAINLY SHEWED.

"I WISH TO ASSURE YOU BOTH," SAID SHE, "THAT I SEE
EVERY THING--AS YOU CAN DESIRE ME TO DO."

MRS. DASHWOOD WOULD HAVE INTERRUPTED HER INSTANTLY
WITH SOOTHING TENDERNESS, HAD NOT ELINOR, WHO REALLY WISHED
TO HEAR HER SISTER'S UNBIASED OPINION, BY AN EAGER SIGN,
ENGAGED HER SILENCE.  MARIANNE SLOWLY CONTINUED--

"IT IS A GREAT RELIEF TO ME--WHAT ELINOR TOLD
ME THIS MORNING--I HAVE NOW HEARD EXACTLY WHAT I
WISHED TO HEAR."--FOR SOME MOMENTS HER VOICE WAS LOST;
BUT RECOVERING HERSELF, SHE ADDED, AND WITH GREATER
CALMNESS THAN BEFORE--"I AM NOW PERFECTLY SATISFIED,
I WISH FOR NO CHANGE.  I NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY
WITH HIM, AFTER KNOWING, AS SOONER OR LATER I MUST
HAVE KNOWN, ALL THIS.--I SHOULD HAVE HAD NO CONFIDENCE,
NO ESTEEM.  NOTHING COULD HAVE DONE IT AWAY TO MY FEELINGS."

"I KNOW IT--I KNOW IT," CRIED HER MOTHER.
"HAPPY WITH A MAN OF LIBERTINE PRACTICES!--WITH ONE
WHO SO INJURED THE PEACE OF THE DEAREST OF OUR FRIENDS,
AND THE BEST OF MEN!--NO--MY MARIANNE HAS NOT A HEART
TO BE MADE HAPPY WITH SUCH A MAN!--HER CONSCIENCE, HER
SENSITIVE CONSCIENCE, WOULD HAVE FELT ALL THAT THE
CONSCIENCE OF HER HUSBAND OUGHT TO HAVE FELT."

MARIANNE SIGHED, AND REPEATED, "I WISH FOR NO CHANGE."

"YOU CONSIDER THE MATTER," SAID ELINOR, "EXACTLY AS
A GOOD MIND AND A SOUND UNDERSTANDING MUST CONSIDER IT;
AND I DARE SAY YOU PERCEIVE, AS WELL AS MYSELF, NOT ONLY
IN THIS, BUT IN MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, REASON ENOUGH
TO BE CONVINCED THAT YOUR MARRIAGE MUST HAVE INVOLVED YOU
IN MANY CERTAIN TROUBLES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS, IN WHICH
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN POORLY SUPPORTED BY AN AFFECTION,
ON HIS SIDE, MUCH LESS CERTAIN.  HAD YOU MARRIED,
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN ALWAYS POOR.  HIS EXPENSIVENESS IS
ACKNOWLEDGED EVEN BY HIMSELF, AND HIS WHOLE CONDUCT DECLARES
THAT SELF-DENIAL IS A WORD HARDLY UNDERSTOOD BY HIM.
HIS DEMANDS AND YOUR INEXPERIENCE TOGETHER, ON A SMALL,
VERY SMALL INCOME, MUST HAVE BROUGHT ON DISTRESSES WHICH
WOULD NOT BE THE LESS GRIEVOUS TO YOU, FROM HAVING BEEN
ENTIRELY UNKNOWN AND UNTHOUGHT OF BEFORE.  YOUR SENSE
OF HONOUR AND HONESTY WOULD HAVE LED YOU, I KNOW,
WHEN AWARE OF YOUR SITUATION, TO ATTEMPT ALL THE ECONOMY
THAT WOULD APPEAR TO YOU POSSIBLE: AND, PERHAPS, AS LONG
AS YOUR FRUGALITY RETRENCHED ONLY ON YOUR OWN COMFORT,
YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUFFERED TO PRACTICE IT, BUT BEYOND THAT--
AND HOW LITTLE COULD THE UTMOST OF YOUR SINGLE MANAGEMENT
DO TO STOP THE RUIN WHICH HAD BEGUN BEFORE YOUR MARRIAGE?--
BEYOND THAT, HAD YOU ENDEAVOURED, HOWEVER REASONABLY,
TO ABRIDGE HIS ENJOYMENTS, IS IT NOT TO BE FEARED, THAT INSTEAD
OF PREVAILING ON FEELINGS SO SELFISH TO CONSENT TO IT,
YOU WOULD HAVE LESSENED YOUR OWN INFLUENCE ON HIS HEART,
AND MADE HIM REGRET THE CONNECTION WHICH HAD INVOLVED HIM
IN SUCH DIFFICULTIES?"

MARIANNE'S LIPS QUIVERED, AND SHE REPEATED THE WORD
"SELFISH?" IN A TONE THAT IMPLIED--"DO YOU REALLY THINK
HIM SELFISH?"

"THE WHOLE OF HIS BEHAVIOUR," REPLIED ELINOR,
"FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE AFFAIR, HAS BEEN
GROUNDED ON SELFISHNESS.  IT WAS SELFISHNESS WHICH FIRST
MADE HIM SPORT WITH YOUR AFFECTIONS; WHICH AFTERWARDS,
WHEN HIS OWN WERE ENGAGED, MADE HIM DELAY THE CONFESSION
OF IT, AND WHICH FINALLY CARRIED HIM FROM BARTON.
HIS OWN ENJOYMENT, OR HIS OWN EASE, WAS, IN EVERY PARTICULAR,
HIS RULING PRINCIPLE."

"IT IS VERY TRUE.  MY HAPPINESS NEVER WAS HIS OBJECT."

"AT PRESENT," CONTINUED ELINOR, "HE REGRETS WHAT HE
HAS DONE.  AND WHY DOES HE REGRET IT?--BECAUSE HE FINDS
IT HAS NOT ANSWERED TOWARDS HIMSELF.  IT HAS NOT MADE
HIM HAPPY.  HIS CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOW UNEMBARRASSED--HE
SUFFERS FROM NO EVIL OF THAT KIND; AND HE THINKS ONLY
THAT HE HAS MARRIED A WOMAN OF A LESS AMIABLE TEMPER
THAN YOURSELF.  BUT DOES IT FOLLOW THAT HAD HE MARRIED YOU,
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY?--THE INCONVENIENCES WOULD HAVE
BEEN DIFFERENT.  HE WOULD THEN HAVE SUFFERED UNDER THE
PECUNIARY DISTRESSES WHICH, BECAUSE THEY ARE REMOVED,
HE NOW RECKONS AS NOTHING.  HE WOULD HAVE HAD A WIFE
OF WHOSE TEMPER HE COULD MAKE NO COMPLAINT, BUT HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN ALWAYS NECESSITOUS--ALWAYS POOR; AND PROBABLY
WOULD SOON HAVE LEARNED TO RANK THE INNUMERABLE COMFORTS
OF A CLEAR ESTATE AND GOOD INCOME AS OF FAR MORE IMPORTANCE,
EVEN TO DOMESTIC HAPPINESS, THAN THE MERE TEMPER OF A WIFE."

"I HAVE NOT A DOUBT OF IT," SAID MARIANNE; "AND I
HAVE NOTHING TO REGRET--NOTHING BUT MY OWN FOLLY."

"RATHER SAY YOUR MOTHER'S IMPRUDENCE, MY CHILD,"
SAID MRS. DASHWOOD; "SHE MUST BE ANSWERABLE."

MARIANNE WOULD NOT LET HER PROCEED;--AND ELINOR,
SATISFIED THAT EACH FELT THEIR OWN ERROR, WISHED TO AVOID
ANY SURVEY OF THE PAST THAT MIGHT WEAKEN HER SISTER'S
SPIRITS; SHE, THEREFORE, PURSUING THE FIRST SUBJECT,
IMMEDIATELY CONTINUED,

"ONE OBSERVATION MAY, I THINK, BE FAIRLY DRAWN FROM
THE WHOLE OF THE STORY--THAT ALL WILLOUGHBY'S DIFFICULTIES
HAVE ARISEN FROM THE FIRST OFFENCE AGAINST VIRTUE, IN HIS
BEHAVIOUR TO ELIZA WILLIAMS.  THAT CRIME HAS BEEN THE ORIGIN
OF EVERY LESSER ONE, AND OF ALL HIS PRESENT DISCONTENTS."

MARIANNE ASSENTED MOST FEELINGLY TO THE REMARK;
AND HER MOTHER WAS LED BY IT TO AN ENUMERATION OF COLONEL
BRANDON'S INJURIES AND MERITS, WARM AS FRIENDSHIP
AND DESIGN COULD UNITEDLY DICTATE.  HER DAUGHTER DID
NOT LOOK, HOWEVER, AS IF MUCH OF IT WERE HEARD BY HER.

ELINOR, ACCORDING TO HER EXPECTATION, SAW ON THE TWO
OR THREE FOLLOWING DAYS, THAT MARIANNE DID NOT CONTINUE
TO GAIN STRENGTH AS SHE HAD DONE; BUT WHILE HER RESOLUTION
WAS UNSUBDUED, AND SHE STILL TRIED TO APPEAR CHEERFUL
AND EASY, HER SISTER COULD SAFELY TRUST TO THE EFFECT
OF TIME UPON HER HEALTH.

MARGARET RETURNED, AND THE FAMILY WERE AGAIN ALL
RESTORED TO EACH OTHER, AGAIN QUIETLY SETTLED AT THE COTTAGE;
AND IF NOT PURSUING THEIR USUAL STUDIES WITH QUITE
SO MUCH VIGOUR AS WHEN THEY FIRST CAME TO BARTON,
AT LEAST PLANNING A VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF THEM IN FUTURE.

ELINOR GREW IMPATIENT FOR SOME TIDINGS OF EDWARD.
SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING OF HIM SINCE HER LEAVING LONDON,
NOTHING NEW OF HIS PLANS, NOTHING CERTAIN EVEN OF HIS
PRESENT ABODE.  SOME LETTERS HAD PASSED BETWEEN HER
AND HER BROTHER, IN CONSEQUENCE OF MARIANNE'S ILLNESS;
AND IN THE FIRST OF JOHN'S, THERE HAD BEEN THIS SENTENCE:--
"WE KNOW NOTHING OF OUR UNFORTUNATE EDWARD, AND CAN MAKE NO
ENQUIRIES ON SO PROHIBITED A SUBJECT, BUT CONCLUDE HIM
TO BE STILL AT OXFORD;" WHICH WAS ALL THE INTELLIGENCE
OF EDWARD AFFORDED HER BY THE CORRESPONDENCE, FOR HIS NAME
WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN ANY OF THE SUCCEEDING LETTERS.
SHE WAS NOT DOOMED, HOWEVER, TO BE LONG IN IGNORANCE OF
HIS MEASURES.

THEIR MAN-SERVANT HAD BEEN SENT ONE MORNING TO EXETER
ON BUSINESS; AND WHEN, AS HE WAITED AT TABLE, HE HAD
SATISFIED THE INQUIRIES OF HIS MISTRESS AS TO THE EVENT
OF HIS ERRAND, THIS WAS HIS VOLUNTARY COMMUNICATION--

"I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW, MA'AM, THAT MR. FERRARS IS MARRIED."

MARIANNE GAVE A VIOLENT START, FIXED HER EYES
UPON ELINOR, SAW HER TURNING PALE, AND FELL BACK IN HER
CHAIR IN HYSTERICS.  MRS. DASHWOOD, WHOSE EYES, AS SHE
ANSWERED THE SERVANT'S INQUIRY, HAD INTUITIVELY TAKEN
THE SAME DIRECTION, WAS SHOCKED TO PERCEIVE BY ELINOR'S
COUNTENANCE HOW MUCH SHE REALLY SUFFERED, AND A MOMENT
AFTERWARDS, ALIKE DISTRESSED BY MARIANNE'S SITUATION,
KNEW NOT ON WHICH CHILD TO BESTOW HER PRINCIPAL ATTENTION.

THE SERVANT, WHO SAW ONLY THAT MISS MARIANNE WAS
TAKEN ILL, HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO CALL ONE OF THE MAIDS,
WHO, WITH MRS. DASHWOOD'S ASSISTANCE, SUPPORTED HER INTO
THE OTHER ROOM.  BY THAT TIME, MARIANNE WAS RATHER BETTER,
AND HER MOTHER LEAVING HER TO THE CARE OF MARGARET
AND THE MAID, RETURNED TO ELINOR, WHO, THOUGH STILL
MUCH DISORDERED, HAD SO FAR RECOVERED THE USE OF HER REASON
AND VOICE AS TO BE JUST BEGINNING AN INQUIRY OF THOMAS,
AS TO THE SOURCE OF HIS INTELLIGENCE.  MRS. DASHWOOD
IMMEDIATELY TOOK ALL THAT TROUBLE ON HERSELF; AND ELINOR
HAD THE BENEFIT OF THE INFORMATION WITHOUT THE EXERTION
OF SEEKING IT.

"WHO TOLD YOU THAT MR. FERRARS WAS MARRIED, THOMAS?"

"I SEE MR. FERRARS MYSELF, MA'AM, THIS MORNING
IN EXETER, AND HIS LADY TOO, MISS STEELE AS WAS.  THEY WAS
STOPPING IN A CHAISE AT THE DOOR OF THE NEW LONDON INN,
AS I WENT THERE WITH A MESSAGE FROM SALLY AT THE PARK
TO HER BROTHER, WHO IS ONE OF THE POST-BOYS. I HAPPENED
TO LOOK UP AS I WENT BY THE CHAISE, AND SO I SEE DIRECTLY
IT WAS THE YOUNGEST MISS STEELE; SO I TOOK OFF MY HAT,
AND SHE KNEW ME AND CALLED TO ME, AND INQUIRED AFTER YOU,
MA'AM, AND THE YOUNG LADIES, ESPECIALLY MISS MARIANNE,
AND BID ME I SHOULD GIVE HER COMPLIMENTS AND MR. FERRARS'S,
THEIR BEST COMPLIMENTS AND SERVICE, AND HOW SORRY THEY
WAS THEY HAD NOT TIME TO COME ON AND SEE YOU, BUT THEY WAS
IN A GREAT HURRY TO GO FORWARDS, FOR THEY WAS GOING FURTHER
DOWN FOR A LITTLE WHILE, BUT HOWSEVER, WHEN THEY COME BACK,
THEY'D MAKE SURE TO COME AND SEE YOU."

"BUT DID SHE TELL YOU SHE WAS MARRIED, THOMAS?"

"YES, MA'AM. SHE SMILED, AND SAID HOW SHE
HAD CHANGED HER NAME SINCE SHE WAS IN THESE PARTS.
SHE WAS ALWAYS A VERY AFFABLE AND FREE-SPOKEN YOUNG LADY,
AND VERY CIVIL BEHAVED.  SO, I MADE FREE TO WISH HER JOY."

"WAS MR. FERRARS IN THE CARRIAGE WITH HER?"

"YES, MA'AM, I JUST SEE HIM LEANING BACK IN IT,
BUT HE DID NOT LOOK UP;--HE NEVER WAS A GENTLEMAN MUCH
FOR TALKING."

ELINOR'S HEART COULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR HIS NOT
PUTTING HIMSELF FORWARD; AND MRS. DASHWOOD PROBABLY
FOUND THE SAME EXPLANATION.

"WAS THERE NO ONE ELSE IN THE CARRIAGE?"

"NO, MA'AM, ONLY THEY TWO."

"DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM?"

"THEY COME STRAIGHT FROM TOWN, AS MISS LUCY--
MRS. FERRARS TOLD ME."

"AND ARE THEY GOING FARTHER WESTWARD?"

"YES, MA'AM--BUT NOT TO BIDE LONG.  THEY WILL SOON
BE BACK AGAIN, AND THEN THEY'D BE SURE AND CALL HERE."

MRS. DASHWOOD NOW LOOKED AT HER DAUGHTER;
BUT ELINOR KNEW BETTER THAN TO EXPECT THEM.
SHE RECOGNISED THE WHOLE OF LUCY IN THE MESSAGE, AND WAS
VERY CONFIDENT THAT EDWARD WOULD NEVER COME NEAR THEM.
SHE OBSERVED IN A LOW VOICE, TO HER MOTHER, THAT THEY
WERE PROBABLY GOING DOWN TO MR. PRATT'S, NEAR PLYMOUTH.

THOMAS'S INTELLIGENCE SEEMED OVER.  ELINOR LOOKED
AS IF SHE WISHED TO HEAR MORE.

"DID YOU SEE THEM OFF, BEFORE YOU CAME AWAY?"

"NO, MA'AM--THE HORSES WERE JUST COMING OUT, BUT I
COULD NOT BIDE ANY LONGER; I WAS AFRAID OF BEING LATE."

"DID MRS. FERRARS LOOK WELL?"

"YES, MA'AM, SHE SAID HOW SHE WAS VERY WELL;
AND TO MY MIND SHE WAS ALWAYS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG
LADY--AND SHE SEEMED VASTLY CONTENTED."

MRS. DASHWOOD COULD THINK OF NO OTHER QUESTION,
AND THOMAS AND THE TABLECLOTH, NOW ALIKE NEEDLESS,
WERE SOON AFTERWARDS DISMISSED.  MARIANNE HAD ALREADY SENT
TO SAY, THAT SHE SHOULD EAT NOTHING MORE.  MRS. DASHWOOD'S
AND ELINOR'S APPETITES WERE EQUALLY LOST, AND MARGARET
MIGHT THINK HERSELF VERY WELL OFF, THAT WITH SO MUCH
UNEASINESS AS BOTH HER SISTERS HAD LATELY EXPERIENCED,
SO MUCH REASON AS THEY HAD OFTEN HAD TO BE CARELESS
OF THEIR MEALS, SHE HAD NEVER BEEN OBLIGED TO GO WITHOUT
HER DINNER BEFORE.

WHEN THE DESSERT AND THE WINE WERE ARRANGED,
AND MRS. DASHWOOD AND ELINOR WERE LEFT BY THEMSELVES,
THEY REMAINED LONG TOGETHER IN A SIMILARITY OF THOUGHTFULNESS
AND SILENCE.  MRS. DASHWOOD FEARED TO HAZARD ANY REMARK,
AND VENTURED NOT TO OFFER CONSOLATION.  SHE NOW FOUND
THAT SHE HAD ERRED IN RELYING ON ELINOR'S REPRESENTATION
OF HERSELF; AND JUSTLY CONCLUDED THAT EVERY THING
HAD BEEN EXPRESSLY SOFTENED AT THE TIME, TO SPARE HER
FROM AN INCREASE OF UNHAPPINESS, SUFFERING AS SHE THEN
HAD SUFFERED FOR MARIANNE.  SHE FOUND THAT SHE HAD BEEN
MISLED BY THE CAREFUL, THE CONSIDERATE ATTENTION OF
HER DAUGHTER, TO THINK THE ATTACHMENT, WHICH ONCE SHE
HAD SO WELL UNDERSTOOD, MUCH SLIGHTER IN REALITY, THAN
SHE HAD BEEN WONT TO BELIEVE, OR THAN IT WAS NOW PROVED
TO BE.  SHE FEARED THAT UNDER THIS PERSUASION SHE HAD
BEEN UNJUST, INATTENTIVE, NAY, ALMOST UNKIND, TO HER ELINOR;--
THAT MARIANNE'S AFFLICTION, BECAUSE MORE ACKNOWLEDGED,
MORE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HER, HAD TOO MUCH ENGROSSED
HER TENDERNESS, AND LED HER AWAY TO FORGET THAT IN ELINOR
SHE MIGHT HAVE A DAUGHTER SUFFERING ALMOST AS MUCH,
CERTAINLY WITH LESS SELF-PROVOCATION, AND GREATER FORTITUDE.



CHAPTER 48


ELINOR NOW FOUND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXPECTATION
OF AN UNPLEASANT EVENT, HOWEVER CERTAIN THE MIND MAY BE TOLD
TO CONSIDER IT, AND CERTAINTY ITSELF.  SHE NOW FOUND, THAT
IN SPITE OF HERSELF, SHE HAD ALWAYS ADMITTED A HOPE,
WHILE EDWARD REMAINED SINGLE, THAT SOMETHING WOULD OCCUR
TO PREVENT HIS MARRYING LUCY; THAT SOME RESOLUTION OF
HIS OWN, SOME MEDIATION OF FRIENDS, OR SOME MORE ELIGIBLE
OPPORTUNITY OF ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE LADY, WOULD ARISE
TO ASSIST THE HAPPINESS OF ALL.  BUT HE WAS NOW MARRIED;
AND SHE CONDEMNED HER HEART FOR THE LURKING FLATTERY,
WHICH SO MUCH HEIGHTENED THE PAIN OF THE INTELLIGENCE.

THAT HE SHOULD BE MARRIED SOON, BEFORE (AS SHE IMAGINED)
HE COULD BE IN ORDERS, AND CONSEQUENTLY BEFORE HE COULD
BE IN POSSESSION OF THE LIVING, SURPRISED HER A LITTLE
AT FIRST.  BUT SHE SOON SAW HOW LIKELY IT WAS THAT LUCY,
IN HER SELF-PROVIDENT CARE, IN HER HASTE TO SECURE HIM,
SHOULD OVERLOOK EVERY THING BUT THE RISK OF DELAY.
THEY WERE MARRIED, MARRIED IN TOWN, AND NOW HASTENING
DOWN TO HER UNCLE'S.  WHAT HAD EDWARD FELT ON BEING WITHIN
FOUR MILES FROM BARTON, ON SEEING HER MOTHER'S SERVANT,
ON HEARING LUCY'S MESSAGE!

THEY WOULD SOON, SHE SUPPOSED, BE SETTLED AT
DELAFORD.--DELAFORD,--THAT PLACE IN WHICH SO MUCH
CONSPIRED TO GIVE HER AN INTEREST; WHICH SHE WISHED
TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH, AND YET DESIRED TO AVOID.
SHE SAW THEM IN AN INSTANT IN THEIR PARSONAGE-HOUSE; SAW
IN LUCY, THE ACTIVE, CONTRIVING MANAGER, UNITING AT ONCE
A DESIRE OF SMART APPEARANCE WITH THE UTMOST FRUGALITY,
AND ASHAMED TO BE SUSPECTED OF HALF HER ECONOMICAL PRACTICES;--
PURSUING HER OWN INTEREST IN EVERY THOUGHT, COURTING THE
FAVOUR OF COLONEL BRANDON, OF MRS. JENNINGS, AND OF EVERY
WEALTHY FRIEND.  IN EDWARD--SHE KNEW NOT WHAT SHE SAW,
NOR WHAT SHE WISHED TO SEE;--HAPPY OR UNHAPPY,--NOTHING
PLEASED HER; SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD FROM EVERY SKETCH OF HIM.

ELINOR FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SOME ONE OF THEIR
CONNECTIONS IN LONDON WOULD WRITE TO THEM TO ANNOUNCE
THE EVENT, AND GIVE FARTHER PARTICULARS,--BUT DAY AFTER
DAY PASSED OFF, AND BROUGHT NO LETTER, NO TIDINGS.
THOUGH UNCERTAIN THAT ANY ONE WERE TO BLAME, SHE FOUND
FAULT WITH EVERY ABSENT FRIEND.  THEY WERE ALL THOUGHTLESS
OR INDOLENT.

"WHEN DO YOU WRITE TO COLONEL BRANDON, MA'AM?"
WAS AN INQUIRY WHICH SPRUNG FROM THE IMPATIENCE
OF HER MIND TO HAVE SOMETHING GOING ON.

"I WROTE TO HIM, MY LOVE, LAST WEEK, AND RATHER
EXPECT TO SEE, THAN TO HEAR FROM HIM AGAIN.  I EARNESTLY
PRESSED HIS COMING TO US, AND SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED
TO SEE HIM WALK IN TODAY OR TOMORROW, OR ANY DAY."

THIS WAS GAINING SOMETHING, SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO.
COLONEL BRANDON MUST HAVE SOME INFORMATION TO GIVE.

SCARCELY HAD SHE SO DETERMINED IT, WHEN THE FIGURE
OF A MAN ON HORSEBACK DREW HER EYES TO THE WINDOW.
HE STOPT AT THEIR GATE.  IT WAS A GENTLEMAN, IT
WAS COLONEL BRANDON HIMSELF.  NOW SHE COULD HEAR MORE;
AND SHE TREMBLED IN EXPECTATION OF IT.  BUT--IT WAS
NOT COLONEL BRANDON--NEITHER HIS AIR--NOR HIS HEIGHT.
WERE IT POSSIBLE, SHE MUST SAY IT MUST BE EDWARD.
SHE LOOKED AGAIN.  HE HAD JUST DISMOUNTED;--SHE COULD NOT BE
MISTAKEN,--IT WAS EDWARD.  SHE MOVED AWAY AND SAT DOWN.
"HE COMES FROM MR. PRATT'S PURPOSELY TO SEE US.  I WILL BE
CALM; I WILL BE MISTRESS OF MYSELF."

IN A MOMENT SHE PERCEIVED THAT THE OTHERS WERE LIKEWISE
AWARE OF THE MISTAKE.  SHE SAW HER MOTHER AND MARIANNE
CHANGE COLOUR; SAW THEM LOOK AT HERSELF, AND WHISPER
A FEW SENTENCES TO EACH OTHER.  SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN
THE WORLD TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK--AND TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND
THAT SHE HOPED NO COOLNESS, NO SLIGHT, WOULD APPEAR
IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR TO HIM;--BUT SHE HAD NO UTTERANCE,
AND WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE ALL TO THEIR OWN DISCRETION.

NOT A SYLLABLE PASSED ALOUD.  THEY ALL WAITED
IN SILENCE FOR THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR VISITOR.
HIS FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD ALONG THE GRAVEL PATH; IN A MOMENT
HE WAS IN THE PASSAGE, AND IN ANOTHER HE WAS BEFORE THEM.

HIS COUNTENANCE, AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM, WAS NOT
TOO HAPPY, EVEN FOR ELINOR.  HIS COMPLEXION WAS WHITE
WITH AGITATION, AND HE LOOKED AS IF FEARFUL OF HIS
RECEPTION, AND CONSCIOUS THAT HE MERITED NO KIND ONE.
MRS. DASHWOOD, HOWEVER, CONFORMING, AS SHE TRUSTED,
TO THE WISHES OF THAT DAUGHTER, BY WHOM SHE THEN MEANT
IN THE WARMTH OF HER HEART TO BE GUIDED IN EVERY THING,
MET WITH A LOOK OF FORCED COMPLACENCY, GAVE HIM HER HAND,
AND WISHED HIM JOY.

HE COLOURED, AND STAMMERED OUT AN UNINTELLIGIBLE REPLY.
ELINOR'S LIPS HAD MOVED WITH HER MOTHER'S, AND, WHEN THE
MOMENT OF ACTION WAS OVER, SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD SHAKEN
HANDS WITH HIM TOO.  BUT IT WAS THEN TOO LATE, AND WITH A
COUNTENANCE MEANING TO BE OPEN, SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN
AND TALKED OF THE WEATHER.

MARIANNE HAD RETREATED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
OUT OF SIGHT, TO CONCEAL HER DISTRESS; AND MARGARET,
UNDERSTANDING SOME PART, BUT NOT THE WHOLE OF THE CASE,
THOUGHT IT INCUMBENT ON HER TO BE DIGNIFIED, AND THEREFORE
TOOK A SEAT AS FAR FROM HIM AS SHE COULD, AND MAINTAINED
A STRICT SILENCE.

WHEN ELINOR HAD CEASED TO REJOICE IN THE DRYNESS
OF THE SEASON, A VERY AWFUL PAUSE TOOK PLACE.  IT WAS PUT
AN END TO BY MRS. DASHWOOD, WHO FELT OBLIGED TO HOPE THAT HE
HAD LEFT MRS. FERRARS VERY WELL.  IN A HURRIED MANNER,
HE REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.

ANOTHER PAUSE.

ELINOR RESOLVING TO EXERT HERSELF, THOUGH FEARING
THE SOUND OF HER OWN VOICE, NOW SAID,

"IS MRS. FERRARS AT LONGSTAPLE?"

"AT LONGSTAPLE!" HE REPLIED, WITH AN AIR OF SURPRISE.--
"NO, MY MOTHER IS IN TOWN."

"I MEANT," SAID ELINOR, TAKING UP SOME WORK FROM
THE TABLE, "TO INQUIRE FOR MRS. EDWARD FERRARS."

SHE DARED NOT LOOK UP;--BUT HER MOTHER AND MARIANNE BOTH
TURNED THEIR EYES ON HIM.  HE COLOURED, SEEMED PERPLEXED,
LOOKED DOUBTINGLY, AND, AFTER SOME HESITATION, SAID,--

"PERHAPS YOU MEAN--MY BROTHER--YOU MEAN MRS.--MRS.
ROBERT FERRARS."

"MRS. ROBERT FERRARS!"--WAS REPEATED BY MARIANNE AND HER
MOTHER IN AN ACCENT OF THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT;--AND THOUGH
ELINOR COULD NOT SPEAK, EVEN HER EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM
WITH THE SAME IMPATIENT WONDER.  HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT,
AND WALKED TO THE WINDOW, APPARENTLY FROM NOT KNOWING
WHAT TO DO; TOOK UP A PAIR OF SCISSORS THAT LAY THERE,
AND WHILE SPOILING BOTH THEM AND THEIR SHEATH BY CUTTING
THE LATTER TO PIECES AS HE SPOKE, SAID, IN A HURRIED VOICE,

"PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW--YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD
THAT MY BROTHER IS LATELY MARRIED TO--TO THE YOUNGEST--TO
MISS LUCY STEELE."

HIS WORDS WERE ECHOED WITH UNSPEAKABLE ASTONISHMENT
BY ALL BUT ELINOR, WHO SAT WITH HER HEAD LEANING OVER
HER WORK, IN A STATE OF SUCH AGITATION AS MADE HER HARDLY
KNOW WHERE SHE WAS.

"YES," SAID HE, "THEY WERE MARRIED LAST WEEK,
AND ARE NOW AT DAWLISH."

ELINOR COULD SIT IT NO LONGER.  SHE ALMOST RAN
OUT OF THE ROOM, AND AS SOON AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED,
BURST INTO TEARS OF JOY, WHICH AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT WOULD
NEVER CEASE.  EDWARD, WHO HAD TILL THEN LOOKED ANY WHERE,
RATHER THAN AT HER, SAW HER HURRY AWAY, AND PERHAPS SAW--
OR EVEN HEARD, HER EMOTION; FOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
HE FELL INTO A REVERIE, WHICH NO REMARKS, NO INQUIRIES,
NO AFFECTIONATE ADDRESS OF MRS. DASHWOOD COULD PENETRATE,
AND AT LAST, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD, QUITTED THE ROOM,
AND WALKED OUT TOWARDS THE VILLAGE--LEAVING THE OTHERS
IN THE GREATEST ASTONISHMENT AND PERPLEXITY ON A CHANGE
IN HIS SITUATION, SO WONDERFUL AND SO SUDDEN;--A PERPLEXITY
WHICH THEY HAD NO MEANS OF LESSENING BUT BY THEIR
OWN CONJECTURES.



CHAPTER 49


UNACCOUNTABLE, HOWEVER, AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS
RELEASE MIGHT APPEAR TO THE WHOLE FAMILY, IT WAS CERTAIN
THAT EDWARD WAS FREE; AND TO WHAT PURPOSE THAT FREEDOM WOULD
BE EMPLOYED WAS EASILY PRE-DETERMINED BY ALL;--FOR AFTER
EXPERIENCING THE BLESSINGS OF ONE IMPRUDENT ENGAGEMENT,
CONTRACTED WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S CONSENT, AS HE HAD ALREADY
DONE FOR MORE THAN FOUR YEARS, NOTHING LESS COULD BE EXPECTED
OF HIM IN THE FAILURE OF THAT, THAN THE IMMEDIATE CONTRACTION
OF ANOTHER.

HIS ERRAND AT BARTON, IN FACT, WAS A SIMPLE ONE.
IT WAS ONLY TO ASK ELINOR TO MARRY HIM;--AND CONSIDERING
THAT HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER INEXPERIENCED IN SUCH A QUESTION,
IT MIGHT BE STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD FEEL SO UNCOMFORTABLE
IN THE PRESENT CASE AS HE REALLY DID, SO MUCH IN NEED OF
ENCOURAGEMENT AND FRESH AIR.

HOW SOON HE HAD WALKED HIMSELF INTO THE PROPER
RESOLUTION, HOWEVER, HOW SOON AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXERCISING
IT OCCURRED, IN WHAT MANNER HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF,
AND HOW HE WAS RECEIVED, NEED NOT BE PARTICULARLY TOLD.
THIS ONLY NEED BE SAID;--THAT WHEN THEY ALL SAT DOWN TO
TABLE AT FOUR O'CLOCK, ABOUT THREE HOURS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL,
HE HAD SECURED HIS LADY, ENGAGED HER MOTHER'S CONSENT,
AND WAS NOT ONLY IN THE RAPTUROUS PROFESSION OF
THE LOVER, BUT, IN THE REALITY OF REASON AND TRUTH,
ONE OF THE HAPPIEST OF MEN.  HIS SITUATION INDEED WAS
MORE THAN COMMONLY JOYFUL.  HE HAD MORE THAN THE ORDINARY
TRIUMPH OF ACCEPTED LOVE TO SWELL HIS HEART, AND RAISE
HIS SPIRITS.  HE WAS RELEASED WITHOUT ANY REPROACH
TO HIMSELF, FROM AN ENTANGLEMENT WHICH HAD LONG FORMED
HIS MISERY, FROM A WOMAN WHOM HE HAD LONG CEASED TO LOVE;--
AND ELEVATED AT ONCE TO THAT SECURITY WITH ANOTHER,
WHICH HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT OF ALMOST WITH DESPAIR,
AS SOON AS HE HAD LEARNT TO CONSIDER IT WITH DESIRE.
HE WAS BROUGHT, NOT FROM DOUBT OR SUSPENSE, BUT FROM
MISERY TO HAPPINESS;--AND THE CHANGE WAS OPENLY SPOKEN
IN SUCH A GENUINE, FLOWING, GRATEFUL CHEERFULNESS,
AS HIS FRIENDS HAD NEVER WITNESSED IN HIM BEFORE.

HIS HEART WAS NOW OPEN TO ELINOR, ALL ITS WEAKNESSES,
ALL ITS ERRORS CONFESSED, AND HIS FIRST BOYISH ATTACHMENT
TO LUCY TREATED WITH ALL THE PHILOSOPHIC DIGNITY OF TWENTY-FOUR.

"IT WAS A FOOLISH, IDLE INCLINATION ON MY SIDE,"
SAID HE, "THE CONSEQUENCE OF IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD--
AND WANT OF EMPLOYMENT.  HAD MY BROTHER GIVEN ME
SOME ACTIVE PROFESSION WHEN I WAS REMOVED AT EIGHTEEN
FROM THE CARE OF MR. PRATT, I THINK--NAY, I AM SURE,
IT WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED; FOR THOUGH I LEFT LONGSTAPLE
WITH WHAT I THOUGHT, AT THE TIME, A MOST UNCONQUERABLE
PREFERENCE FOR HIS NIECE, YET HAD I THEN HAD ANY PURSUIT,
ANY OBJECT TO ENGAGE MY TIME AND KEEP ME AT A DISTANCE
FROM HER FOR A FEW MONTHS, I SHOULD VERY SOON HAVE
OUTGROWN THE FANCIED ATTACHMENT, ESPECIALLY BY MIXING
MORE WITH THE WORLD, AS IN SUCH CASE I MUST HAVE DONE.
BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY THING TO DO, INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY
PROFESSION CHOSEN FOR ME, OR BEING ALLOWED TO CHUSE ANY MYSELF,
I RETURNED HOME TO BE COMPLETELY IDLE; AND FOR THE FIRST
TWELVEMONTH AFTERWARDS I HAD NOT EVEN THE NOMINAL EMPLOYMENT,
WHICH BELONGING TO THE UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME;
FOR I WAS NOT ENTERED AT OXFORD TILL I WAS NINETEEN.
I HAD THEREFORE NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO DO, BUT TO FANCY
MYSELF IN LOVE; AND AS MY MOTHER DID NOT MAKE MY HOME
IN EVERY RESPECT COMFORTABLE, AS I HAD NO FRIEND,
NO COMPANION IN MY BROTHER, AND DISLIKED NEW ACQUAINTANCE,
IT WAS NOT UNNATURAL FOR ME TO BE VERY OFTEN AT LONGSTAPLE,
WHERE I ALWAYS FELT MYSELF AT HOME, AND WAS ALWAYS SURE
OF A WELCOME; AND ACCORDINGLY I SPENT THE GREATEST PART
OF MY TIME THERE FROM EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN: LUCY APPEARED
EVERYTHING THAT WAS AMIABLE AND OBLIGING.  SHE WAS PRETTY
TOO--AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THEN; AND I HAD SEEN SO LITTLE
OF OTHER WOMEN, THAT I COULD MAKE NO COMPARISONS, AND SEE
NO DEFECTS.  CONSIDERING EVERYTHING, THEREFORE, I HOPE,
FOOLISH AS OUR ENGAGEMENT WAS, FOOLISH AS IT HAS SINCE
IN EVERY WAY BEEN PROVED, IT WAS NOT AT THE TIME AN UNNATURAL
OR AN INEXCUSABLE PIECE OF FOLLY."

THE CHANGE WHICH A FEW HOURS HAD WROUGHT IN THE MINDS
AND THE HAPPINESS OF THE DASHWOODS, WAS SUCH--SO GREAT--AS
PROMISED THEM ALL, THE SATISFACTION OF A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.
MRS. DASHWOOD, TOO HAPPY TO BE COMFORTABLE, KNEW NOT HOW
TO LOVE EDWARD, NOR PRAISE ELINOR ENOUGH, HOW TO BE ENOUGH
THANKFUL FOR HIS RELEASE WITHOUT WOUNDING HIS DELICACY,
NOR HOW AT ONCE TO GIVE THEM LEISURE FOR UNRESTRAINED
CONVERSATION TOGETHER, AND YET ENJOY, AS SHE WISHED,
THE SIGHT AND SOCIETY OF BOTH.

MARIANNE COULD SPEAK HER HAPPINESS ONLY BY TEARS.
COMPARISONS WOULD OCCUR--REGRETS WOULD ARISE;--AND HER JOY,
THOUGH SINCERE AS HER LOVE FOR HER SISTER, WAS OF A KIND TO
GIVE HER NEITHER SPIRITS NOR LANGUAGE.

BUT ELINOR--HOW ARE HER FEELINGS TO BE DESCRIBED?--FROM
THE MOMENT OF LEARNING THAT LUCY WAS MARRIED TO ANOTHER,
THAT EDWARD WAS FREE, TO THE MOMENT OF HIS JUSTIFYING
THE HOPES WHICH HAD SO INSTANTLY FOLLOWED, SHE WAS EVERY
THING BY TURNS BUT TRANQUIL.  BUT WHEN THE SECOND MOMENT
HAD PASSED, WHEN SHE FOUND EVERY DOUBT, EVERY SOLICITUDE
REMOVED, COMPARED HER SITUATION WITH WHAT SO LATELY IT
HAD BEEN,--SAW HIM HONOURABLY RELEASED FROM HIS FORMER
ENGAGEMENT, SAW HIM INSTANTLY PROFITING BY THE RELEASE,
TO ADDRESS HERSELF AND DECLARE AN AFFECTION AS TENDER,
AS CONSTANT AS SHE HAD EVER SUPPOSED IT TO BE,--SHE
WAS OPPRESSED, SHE WAS OVERCOME BY HER OWN FELICITY;--
AND HAPPILY DISPOSED AS IS THE HUMAN MIND TO BE EASILY
FAMILIARIZED WITH ANY CHANGE FOR THE BETTER, IT REQUIRED
SEVERAL HOURS TO GIVE SEDATENESS TO HER SPIRITS, OR ANY
DEGREE OF TRANQUILLITY TO HER HEART.

EDWARD WAS NOW FIXED AT THE COTTAGE AT LEAST FOR
A WEEK;--FOR WHATEVER OTHER CLAIMS MIGHT BE MADE ON HIM,
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT LESS THAN A WEEK SHOULD BE GIVEN
UP TO THE ENJOYMENT OF ELINOR'S COMPANY, OR SUFFICE
TO SAY HALF THAT WAS TO BE SAID OF THE PAST, THE PRESENT,
AND THE FUTURE;--FOR THOUGH A VERY FEW HOURS SPENT IN
THE HARD LABOR OF INCESSANT TALKING WILL DESPATCH MORE
SUBJECTS THAN CAN REALLY BE IN COMMON BETWEEN ANY TWO
RATIONAL CREATURES, YET WITH LOVERS IT IS DIFFERENT.
BETWEEN THEM NO SUBJECT IS FINISHED, NO COMMUNICATION
IS EVEN MADE, TILL IT HAS BEEN MADE AT LEAST TWENTY
TIMES OVER.

LUCY'S MARRIAGE, THE UNCEASING AND REASONABLE WONDER
AMONG THEM ALL, FORMED OF COURSE ONE OF THE EARLIEST
DISCUSSIONS OF THE LOVERS;--AND ELINOR'S PARTICULAR KNOWLEDGE
OF EACH PARTY MADE IT APPEAR TO HER IN EVERY VIEW, AS ONE
OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND UNACCOUNTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
SHE HAD EVER HEARD.  HOW THEY COULD BE THROWN TOGETHER,
AND BY WHAT ATTRACTION ROBERT COULD BE DRAWN ON TO MARRY
A GIRL, OF WHOSE BEAUTY SHE HAD HERSELF HEARD HIM SPEAK
WITHOUT ANY ADMIRATION,--A GIRL TOO ALREADY ENGAGED
TO HIS BROTHER, AND ON WHOSE ACCOUNT THAT BROTHER HAD BEEN
THROWN OFF BY HIS FAMILY--IT WAS BEYOND HER COMPREHENSION
TO MAKE OUT.  TO HER OWN HEART IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL AFFAIR,
TO HER IMAGINATION IT WAS EVEN A RIDICULOUS ONE, BUT
TO HER REASON, HER JUDGMENT, IT WAS COMPLETELY A PUZZLE.

EDWARD COULD ONLY ATTEMPT AN EXPLANATION BY SUPPOSING,
THAT, PERHAPS, AT FIRST ACCIDENTALLY MEETING, THE VANITY
OF THE ONE HAD BEEN SO WORKED ON BY THE FLATTERY
OF THE OTHER, AS TO LEAD BY DEGREES TO ALL THE REST.
ELINOR REMEMBERED WHAT ROBERT HAD TOLD HER IN HARLEY STREET,
OF HIS OPINION OF WHAT HIS OWN MEDIATION IN HIS BROTHER'S
AFFAIRS MIGHT HAVE DONE, IF APPLIED TO IN TIME.
SHE REPEATED IT TO EDWARD.

"THAT WAS EXACTLY LIKE ROBERT,"--WAS HIS IMMEDIATE
OBSERVATION.--"AND THAT," HE PRESENTLY ADDED, "MIGHT
PERHAPS BE IN HIS HEAD WHEN THE ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN
THEM FIRST BEGAN.  AND LUCY PERHAPS AT FIRST MIGHT
THINK ONLY OF PROCURING HIS GOOD OFFICES IN MY FAVOUR.
OTHER DESIGNS MIGHT AFTERWARD ARISE."

HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN CARRYING ON BETWEEN THEM,
HOWEVER, HE WAS EQUALLY AT A LOSS WITH HERSELF TO MAKE OUT;
FOR AT OXFORD, WHERE HE HAD REMAINED FOR CHOICE EVER SINCE
HIS QUITTING LONDON, HE HAD HAD NO MEANS OF HEARING OF HER
BUT FROM HERSELF, AND HER LETTERS TO THE VERY LAST WERE
NEITHER LESS FREQUENT, NOR LESS AFFECTIONATE THAN USUAL.
NOT THE SMALLEST SUSPICION, THEREFORE, HAD EVER OCCURRED
TO PREPARE HIM FOR WHAT FOLLOWED;--AND WHEN AT LAST IT
BURST ON HIM IN A LETTER FROM LUCY HERSELF, HE HAD BEEN
FOR SOME TIME, HE BELIEVED, HALF STUPIFIED BETWEEN
THE WONDER, THE HORROR, AND THE JOY OF SUCH A DELIVERANCE.
HE PUT THE LETTER INTO ELINOR'S HANDS.

     "DEAR SIR,

     "BEING VERY SURE I HAVE LONG LOST YOUR AFFECTIONS,
     I HAVE THOUGHT MYSELF AT LIBERTY TO BESTOW MY OWN
     ON ANOTHER, AND HAVE NO DOUBT OF BEING AS HAPPY WITH
     HIM AS I ONCE USED TO THINK I MIGHT BE WITH YOU;
     BUT I SCORN TO ACCEPT A HAND WHILE THE HEART WAS
     ANOTHER'S.  SINCERELY WISH YOU HAPPY IN YOUR CHOICE,
     AND IT SHALL NOT BE MY FAULT IF WE ARE NOT ALWAYS
     GOOD FRIENDS, AS OUR NEAR RELATIONSHIP NOW MAKES
     PROPER.  I CAN SAFELY SAY I OWE YOU NO ILL-WILL,
     AND AM SURE YOU WILL BE TOO GENEROUS TO DO US ANY
     ILL OFFICES.  YOUR BROTHER HAS GAINED MY AFFECTIONS
     ENTIRELY, AND AS WE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT ONE
     ANOTHER, WE ARE JUST RETURNED FROM THE ALTAR, AND
     ARE NOW ON OUR WAY TO DAWLISH FOR A FEW WEEKS, WHICH
     PLACE YOUR DEAR BROTHER HAS GREAT CURIOSITY TO SEE,
     BUT THOUGHT I WOULD FIRST TROUBLE YOU WITH THESE
     FEW LINES, AND SHALL ALWAYS REMAIN,

     "YOUR SINCERE WELL-WISHER, FRIEND, AND SISTER,
                                        "LUCY FERRARS.

     "I HAVE BURNT ALL YOUR LETTERS, AND WILL RETURN
     YOUR PICTURE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY.  PLEASE TO DESTROY
     MY SCRAWLS--BUT THE RING WITH MY HAIR YOU ARE VERY
     WELCOME TO KEEP."

ELINOR READ AND RETURNED IT WITHOUT ANY COMMENT.

"I WILL NOT ASK YOUR OPINION OF IT AS A COMPOSITION,"
SAID EDWARD.--"FOR WORLDS WOULD NOT I HAVE HAD A LETTER
OF HERS SEEN BY YOU IN FORMER DAYS.--IN A SISTER IT
IS BAD ENOUGH, BUT IN A WIFE!--HOW I HAVE BLUSHED OVER
THE PAGES OF HER WRITING!--AND I BELIEVE I MAY SAY THAT
SINCE THE FIRST HALF YEAR OF OUR FOOLISH--BUSINESS--THIS
IS THE ONLY LETTER I EVER RECEIVED FROM HER, OF WHICH
THE SUBSTANCE MADE ME ANY AMENDS FOR THE DEFECT OF THE STYLE."

"HOWEVER IT MAY HAVE COME ABOUT," SAID ELINOR,
AFTER A PAUSE,--"THEY ARE CERTAINLY MARRIED.  AND YOUR MOTHER
HAS BROUGHT ON HERSELF A MOST APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT.
THE INDEPENDENCE SHE SETTLED ON ROBERT, THROUGH RESENTMENT
AGAINST YOU, HAS PUT IT IN HIS POWER TO MAKE HIS OWN CHOICE;
AND SHE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN BRIBING ONE SON WITH A THOUSAND
A-YEAR, TO DO THE VERY DEED WHICH SHE DISINHERITED THE
OTHER FOR INTENDING TO DO.  SHE WILL HARDLY BE LESS HURT,
I SUPPOSE, BY ROBERT'S MARRYING LUCY, THAN SHE WOULD HAVE
BEEN BY YOUR MARRYING HER."

"SHE WILL BE MORE HURT BY IT, FOR ROBERT ALWAYS
WAS HER FAVOURITE.--SHE WILL BE MORE HURT BY IT,
AND ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE WILL FORGIVE HIM MUCH SOONER."

IN WHAT STATE THE AFFAIR STOOD AT PRESENT BETWEEN THEM,
EDWARD KNEW NOT, FOR NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANY OF HIS FAMILY
HAD YET BEEN ATTEMPTED BY HIM.  HE HAD QUITTED OXFORD
WITHIN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AFTER LUCY'S LETTER ARRIVED,
AND WITH ONLY ONE OBJECT BEFORE HIM, THE NEAREST ROAD
TO BARTON, HAD HAD NO LEISURE TO FORM ANY SCHEME OF CONDUCT,
WITH WHICH THAT ROAD DID NOT HOLD THE MOST INTIMATE CONNECTION.
HE COULD DO NOTHING TILL HE WERE ASSURED OF HIS FATE WITH
MISS DASHWOOD; AND BY HIS RAPIDITY IN SEEKING THAT FATE,
IT IS TO BE SUPPOSED, IN SPITE OF THE JEALOUSY WITH
WHICH HE HAD ONCE THOUGHT OF COLONEL BRANDON, IN SPITE
OF THE MODESTY WITH WHICH HE RATED HIS OWN DESERTS,
AND THE POLITENESS WITH WHICH HE TALKED OF HIS DOUBTS,
HE DID NOT, UPON THE WHOLE, EXPECT A VERY CRUEL RECEPTION.
IT WAS HIS BUSINESS, HOWEVER, TO SAY THAT HE DID, AND HE
SAID IT VERY PRETTILY.  WHAT HE MIGHT SAY ON THE SUBJECT
A TWELVEMONTH AFTER, MUST BE REFERRED TO THE IMAGINATION
OF HUSBANDS AND WIVES.

THAT LUCY HAD CERTAINLY MEANT TO DECEIVE, TO GO OFF
WITH A FLOURISH OF MALICE AGAINST HIM IN HER MESSAGE
BY THOMAS, WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR TO ELINOR; AND EDWARD HIMSELF,
NOW THOROUGHLY ENLIGHTENED ON HER CHARACTER, HAD NO
SCRUPLE IN BELIEVING HER CAPABLE OF THE UTMOST MEANNESS
OF WANTON ILL-NATURE. THOUGH HIS EYES HAD BEEN LONG OPENED,
EVEN BEFORE HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH ELINOR BEGAN, TO HER
IGNORANCE AND A WANT OF LIBERALITY IN SOME OF HER OPINIONS--
THEY HAD BEEN EQUALLY IMPUTED, BY HIM, TO HER WANT
OF EDUCATION; AND TILL HER LAST LETTER REACHED HIM,
HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED HER TO BE A WELL-DISPOSED,
GOOD-HEARTED GIRL, AND THOROUGHLY ATTACHED TO HIMSELF.
NOTHING BUT SUCH A PERSUASION COULD HAVE PREVENTED
HIS PUTTING AN END TO AN ENGAGEMENT, WHICH, LONG BEFORE
THE DISCOVERY OF IT LAID HIM OPEN TO HIS MOTHER'S ANGER,
HAD BEEN A CONTINUAL SOURCE OF DISQUIET AND REGRET TO HIM.

"I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY," SAID HE, "INDEPENDENT OF MY FEELINGS,
TO GIVE HER THE OPTION OF CONTINUING THE ENGAGEMENT OR NOT,
WHEN I WAS RENOUNCED BY MY MOTHER, AND STOOD TO ALL
APPEARANCE WITHOUT A FRIEND IN THE WORLD TO ASSIST ME.
IN SUCH A SITUATION AS THAT, WHERE THERE SEEMED NOTHING
TO TEMPT THE AVARICE OR THE VANITY OF ANY LIVING CREATURE,
HOW COULD I SUPPOSE, WHEN SHE SO EARNESTLY, SO WARMLY INSISTED
ON SHARING MY FATE, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, THAT ANY THING
BUT THE MOST DISINTERESTED AFFECTION WAS HER INDUCEMENT?
AND EVEN NOW, I CANNOT COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVE SHE ACTED,
OR WHAT FANCIED ADVANTAGE IT COULD BE TO HER, TO BE
FETTERED TO A MAN FOR WHOM SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST REGARD,
AND WHO HAD ONLY TWO THOUSAND POUNDS IN THE WORLD.
SHE COULD NOT FORESEE THAT COLONEL BRANDON WOULD GIVE ME A
LIVING."

"NO; BUT SHE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT SOMETHING WOULD OCCUR
IN YOUR FAVOUR; THAT YOUR OWN FAMILY MIGHT IN TIME RELENT.
AND AT ANY RATE, SHE LOST NOTHING BY CONTINUING THE ENGAGEMENT,
FOR SHE HAS PROVED THAT IT FETTERED NEITHER HER INCLINATION
NOR HER ACTIONS.  THE CONNECTION WAS CERTAINLY A
RESPECTABLE ONE, AND PROBABLY GAINED HER CONSIDERATION AMONG
HER FRIENDS; AND, IF NOTHING MORE ADVANTAGEOUS OCCURRED,
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER TO MARRY YOU THAN BE SINGLE."

EDWARD WAS, OF COURSE, IMMEDIATELY CONVINCED THAT
NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE NATURAL THAN LUCY'S CONDUCT,
NOR MORE SELF-EVIDENT THAN THE MOTIVE OF IT.

ELINOR SCOLDED HIM, HARSHLY AS LADIES ALWAYS SCOLD
THE IMPRUDENCE WHICH COMPLIMENTS THEMSELVES, FOR HAVING
SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH THEM AT NORLAND, WHEN HE MUST
HAVE FELT HIS OWN INCONSTANCY.

"YOUR BEHAVIOUR WAS CERTAINLY VERY WRONG," SAID SHE;
"BECAUSE--TO SAY NOTHING OF MY OWN CONVICTION, OUR RELATIONS
WERE ALL LED AWAY BY IT TO FANCY AND EXPECT WHAT, AS YOU
WERE THEN SITUATED, COULD NEVER BE."

HE COULD ONLY PLEAD AN IGNORANCE OF HIS OWN HEART,
AND A MISTAKEN CONFIDENCE IN THE FORCE OF HIS ENGAGEMENT.

"I WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO THINK, THAT BECAUSE MY FAITH
WAS PLIGHTED TO ANOTHER, THERE COULD BE NO DANGER IN MY BEING
WITH YOU; AND THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY ENGAGEMENT WAS
TO KEEP MY HEART AS SAFE AND SACRED AS MY HONOUR.  I FELT
THAT I ADMIRED YOU, BUT I TOLD MYSELF IT WAS ONLY FRIENDSHIP;
AND TILL I BEGAN TO MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN YOURSELF
AND LUCY, I DID NOT KNOW HOW FAR I WAS GOT.  AFTER THAT,
I SUPPOSE, I WAS WRONG IN REMAINING SO MUCH IN SUSSEX,
AND THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH I RECONCILED MYSELF TO THE
EXPEDIENCY OF IT, WERE NO BETTER THAN THESE:--THE DANGER
IS MY OWN; I AM DOING NO INJURY TO ANYBODY BUT MYSELF."

ELINOR SMILED, AND SHOOK HER HEAD.

EDWARD HEARD WITH PLEASURE OF COLONEL BRANDON'S
BEING EXPECTED AT THE COTTAGE, AS HE REALLY WISHED
NOT ONLY TO BE BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HIM, BUT TO HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY OF CONVINCING HIM THAT HE NO LONGER RESENTED
HIS GIVING HIM THE LIVING OF DELAFORD--"WHICH, AT PRESENT,"
SAID HE, "AFTER THANKS SO UNGRACIOUSLY DELIVERED AS MINE
WERE ON THE OCCASION, HE MUST THINK I HAVE NEVER FORGIVEN
HIM FOR OFFERING."

NOW HE FELT ASTONISHED HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NEVER YET
BEEN TO THE PLACE.  BUT SO LITTLE INTEREST HAD BE TAKEN
IN THE MATTER, THAT HE OWED ALL HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOUSE,
GARDEN, AND GLEBE, EXTENT OF THE PARISH, CONDITION OF
THE LAND, AND RATE OF THE TITHES, TO ELINOR HERSELF,
WHO HAD HEARD SO MUCH OF IT FROM COLONEL BRANDON,
AND HEARD IT WITH SO MUCH ATTENTION, AS TO BE ENTIRELY
MISTRESS OF THE SUBJECT.

ONE QUESTION AFTER THIS ONLY REMAINED UNDECIDED,
BETWEEN THEM, ONE DIFFICULTY ONLY WAS TO BE OVERCOME.
THEY WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER BY MUTUAL AFFECTION,
WITH THE WARMEST APPROBATION OF THEIR REAL FRIENDS;
THEIR INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER SEEMED TO MAKE
THEIR HAPPINESS CERTAIN--AND THEY ONLY WANTED SOMETHING
TO LIVE UPON.  EDWARD HAD TWO THOUSAND POUNDS, AND ELINOR
ONE, WHICH, WITH DELAFORD LIVING, WAS ALL THAT THEY COULD
CALL THEIR OWN; FOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT MRS. DASHWOOD
SHOULD ADVANCE ANYTHING; AND THEY WERE NEITHER OF THEM
QUITE ENOUGH IN LOVE TO THINK THAT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
POUNDS A-YEAR WOULD SUPPLY THEM WITH THE COMFORTS OF LIFE.

EDWARD WAS NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT HOPES OF SOME
FAVOURABLE CHANGE IN HIS MOTHER TOWARDS HIM; AND ON THAT
HE RESTED FOR THE RESIDUE OF THEIR INCOME.  BUT ELINOR
HAD NO SUCH DEPENDENCE; FOR SINCE EDWARD WOULD STILL
BE UNABLE TO MARRY MISS MORTON, AND HIS CHUSING HERSELF
HAD BEEN SPOKEN OF IN MRS. FERRARS'S FLATTERING LANGUAGE
AS ONLY A LESSER EVIL THAN HIS CHUSING LUCY STEELE,
SHE FEARED THAT ROBERT'S OFFENCE WOULD SERVE NO OTHER
PURPOSE THAN TO ENRICH FANNY.

ABOUT FOUR DAYS AFTER EDWARD'S ARRIVAL COLONEL
BRANDON APPEARED, TO COMPLETE MRS. DASHWOOD'S SATISFACTION,
AND TO GIVE HER THE DIGNITY OF HAVING, FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE HER LIVING AT BARTON, MORE COMPANY WITH HER THAN
HER HOUSE WOULD HOLD.  EDWARD WAS ALLOWED TO RETAIN THE
PRIVILEGE OF FIRST COMER, AND COLONEL BRANDON THEREFORE
WALKED EVERY NIGHT TO HIS OLD QUARTERS AT THE PARK;
FROM WHENCE HE USUALLY RETURNED IN THE MORNING, EARLY ENOUGH
TO INTERRUPT THE LOVERS' FIRST TETE-A-TETE BEFORE BREAKFAST.

A THREE WEEKS' RESIDENCE AT DELAFORD, WHERE,
IN HIS EVENING HOURS AT LEAST, HE HAD LITTLE TO DO
BUT TO CALCULATE THE DISPROPORTION BETWEEN THIRTY-SIX
AND SEVENTEEN, BROUGHT HIM TO BARTON IN A TEMPER OF MIND
WHICH NEEDED ALL THE IMPROVEMENT IN MARIANNE'S LOOKS,
ALL THE KINDNESS OF HER WELCOME, AND ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT
OF HER MOTHER'S LANGUAGE, TO MAKE IT CHEERFUL.
AMONG SUCH FRIENDS, HOWEVER, AND SUCH FLATTERY, HE DID REVIVE.
NO RUMOUR OF LUCY'S MARRIAGE HAD YET REACHED HIM:--HE KNEW
NOTHING OF WHAT HAD PASSED; AND THE FIRST HOURS OF HIS
VISIT WERE CONSEQUENTLY SPENT IN HEARING AND IN WONDERING.
EVERY THING WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM BY MRS. DASHWOOD,
AND HE FOUND FRESH REASON TO REJOICE IN WHAT HE HAD DONE
FOR MR. FERRARS, SINCE EVENTUALLY IT PROMOTED THE INTEREST
OF ELINOR.

IT WOULD BE NEEDLESS TO SAY, THAT THE GENTLEMEN ADVANCED
IN THE GOOD OPINION OF EACH OTHER, AS THEY ADVANCED IN EACH
OTHER'S ACQUAINTANCE, FOR IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE.
THEIR RESEMBLANCE IN GOOD PRINCIPLES AND GOOD SENSE,
IN DISPOSITION AND MANNER OF THINKING, WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO UNITE THEM IN FRIENDSHIP,
WITHOUT ANY OTHER ATTRACTION; BUT THEIR BEING IN LOVE
WITH TWO SISTERS, AND TWO SISTERS FOND OF EACH OTHER,
MADE THAT MUTUAL REGARD INEVITABLE AND IMMEDIATE,
WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE WAITED THE EFFECT OF TIME
AND JUDGMENT.

THE LETTERS FROM TOWN, WHICH A FEW DAYS BEFORE WOULD
HAVE MADE EVERY NERVE IN ELINOR'S BODY THRILL WITH TRANSPORT,
NOW ARRIVED TO BE READ WITH LESS EMOTION THAT MIRTH.
MRS. JENNINGS WROTE TO TELL THE WONDERFUL TALE, TO VENT HER
HONEST INDIGNATION AGAINST THE JILTING GIRL, AND POUR FORTH
HER COMPASSION TOWARDS POOR MR. EDWARD, WHO, SHE WAS SURE,
HAD QUITE DOTED UPON THE WORTHLESS HUSSY, AND WAS NOW,
BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ALMOST BROKEN-HEARTED, AT OXFORD.--
"I DO THINK," SHE CONTINUED, "NOTHING WAS EVER CARRIED
ON SO SLY; FOR IT WAS BUT TWO DAYS BEFORE LUCY CALLED
AND SAT A COUPLE OF HOURS WITH ME.  NOT A SOUL SUSPECTED
ANYTHING OF THE MATTER, NOT EVEN NANCY, WHO, POOR SOUL!
CAME CRYING TO ME THE DAY AFTER, IN A GREAT FRIGHT
FOR FEAR OF MRS. FERRARS, AS WELL AS NOT KNOWING HOW TO
GET TO PLYMOUTH; FOR LUCY IT SEEMS BORROWED ALL HER
MONEY BEFORE SHE WENT OFF TO BE MARRIED, ON PURPOSE
WE SUPPOSE TO MAKE A SHOW WITH, AND POOR NANCY HAD NOT
SEVEN SHILLINGS IN THE WORLD;--SO I WAS VERY GLAD TO GIVE
HER FIVE GUINEAS TO TAKE HER DOWN TO EXETER, WHERE SHE
THINKS OF STAYING THREE OR FOUR WEEKS WITH MRS. BURGESS,
IN HOPES, AS I TELL HER, TO FALL IN WITH THE DOCTOR AGAIN.
AND I MUST SAY THAT LUCY'S CROSSNESS NOT TO TAKE THEM
ALONG WITH THEM IN THE CHAISE IS WORSE THAN ALL.
POOR MR. EDWARD! I CANNOT GET HIM OUT OF MY HEAD, BUT YOU
MUST SEND FOR HIM TO BARTON, AND MISS MARIANNE MUST TRY TO
COMFORT HIM."

MR. DASHWOOD'S STRAINS WERE MORE SOLEMN.
MRS. FERRARS WAS THE MOST UNFORTUNATE OF WOMEN--POOR
FANNY HAD SUFFERED AGONIES OF SENSIBILITY--AND HE
CONSIDERED THE EXISTENCE OF EACH, UNDER SUCH A BLOW,
WITH GRATEFUL WONDER.  ROBERT'S OFFENCE WAS UNPARDONABLE,
BUT LUCY'S WAS INFINITELY WORSE.  NEITHER OF THEM WERE
EVER AGAIN TO BE MENTIONED TO MRS. FERRARS; AND EVEN,
IF SHE MIGHT HEREAFTER BE INDUCED TO FORGIVE HER SON,
HIS WIFE SHOULD NEVER BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS HER DAUGHTER,
NOR BE PERMITTED TO APPEAR IN HER PRESENCE.  THE SECRECY
WITH WHICH EVERYTHING HAD BEEN CARRIED ON BETWEEN THEM,
WAS RATIONALLY TREATED AS ENORMOUSLY HEIGHTENING
THE CRIME, BECAUSE, HAD ANY SUSPICION OF IT OCCURRED
TO THE OTHERS, PROPER MEASURES WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
TO PREVENT THE MARRIAGE; AND HE CALLED ON ELINOR TO JOIN
WITH HIM IN REGRETTING THAT LUCY'S ENGAGEMENT WITH EDWARD
HAD NOT RATHER BEEN FULFILLED, THAN THAT SHE SHOULD THUS
BE THE MEANS OF SPREADING MISERY FARTHER IN THE FAMILY.--
HE THUS CONTINUED:

"MRS. FERRARS HAS NEVER YET MENTIONED EDWARD'S NAME,
WHICH DOES NOT SURPRISE US; BUT, TO OUR GREAT ASTONISHMENT,
NOT A LINE HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM HIM ON THE OCCASION.
PERHAPS, HOWEVER, HE IS KEPT SILENT BY HIS FEAR OF OFFENDING,
AND I SHALL, THEREFORE, GIVE HIM A HINT, BY A LINE
TO OXFORD, THAT HIS SISTER AND I BOTH THINK A LETTER
OF PROPER SUBMISSION FROM HIM, ADDRESSED PERHAPS TO FANNY,
AND BY HER SHEWN TO HER MOTHER, MIGHT NOT BE TAKEN AMISS;
FOR WE ALL KNOW THE TENDERNESS OF MRS. FERRARS'S HEART,
AND THAT SHE WISHES FOR NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO BE ON GOOD TERMS
WITH HER CHILDREN."

THIS PARAGRAPH WAS OF SOME IMPORTANCE TO THE
PROSPECTS AND CONDUCT OF EDWARD.  IT DETERMINED HIM
TO ATTEMPT A RECONCILIATION, THOUGH NOT EXACTLY
IN THE MANNER POINTED OUT BY THEIR BROTHER AND SISTER.

"A LETTER OF PROPER SUBMISSION!" REPEATED HE;
"WOULD THEY HAVE ME BEG MY MOTHER'S PARDON FOR ROBERT'S
INGRATITUDE TO HER, AND BREACH OF HONOUR TO ME?--I CAN
MAKE NO SUBMISSION--I AM GROWN NEITHER HUMBLE NOR
PENITENT BY WHAT HAS PASSED.--I AM GROWN VERY HAPPY;
BUT THAT WOULD NOT INTEREST.--I KNOW OF NO SUBMISSION
THAT IS PROPER FOR ME TO MAKE."

"YOU MAY CERTAINLY ASK TO BE FORGIVEN," SAID ELINOR,
"BECAUSE YOU HAVE OFFENDED;--AND I SHOULD THINK YOU
MIGHT NOW VENTURE SO FAR AS TO PROFESS SOME CONCERN
FOR HAVING EVER FORMED THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH DREW ON YOU
YOUR MOTHER'S ANGER."

HE AGREED THAT HE MIGHT.

"AND WHEN SHE HAS FORGIVEN YOU, PERHAPS A LITTLE HUMILITY
MAY BE CONVENIENT WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING A SECOND ENGAGEMENT,
ALMOST AS IMPRUDENT IN HER EYES AS THE FIRST."

HE HAD NOTHING TO URGE AGAINST IT, BUT STILL
RESISTED THE IDEA OF A LETTER OF PROPER SUBMISSION;
AND THEREFORE, TO MAKE IT EASIER TO HIM, AS HE DECLARED
A MUCH GREATER WILLINGNESS TO MAKE MEAN CONCESSIONS
BY WORD OF MOUTH THAN ON PAPER, IT WAS RESOLVED THAT,
INSTEAD OF WRITING TO FANNY, HE SHOULD GO TO LONDON,
AND PERSONALLY INTREAT HER GOOD OFFICES IN HIS FAVOUR.--
"AND IF THEY REALLY DO INTEREST THEMSELVES," SAID MARIANNE,
IN HER NEW CHARACTER OF CANDOUR, "IN BRINGING ABOUT
A RECONCILIATION, I SHALL THINK THAT EVEN JOHN AND FANNY
ARE NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT MERIT."

AFTER A VISIT ON COLONEL BRANDON'S SIDE OF ONLY THREE
OR FOUR DAYS, THE TWO GENTLEMEN QUITTED BARTON TOGETHER.--
THEY WERE TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO DELAFORD, THAT EDWARD
MIGHT HAVE SOME PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF HIS FUTURE HOME,
AND ASSIST HIS PATRON AND FRIEND IN DECIDING ON WHAT
IMPROVEMENTS WERE NEEDED TO IT; AND FROM THENCE,
AFTER STAYING THERE A COUPLE OF NIGHTS, HE WAS TO PROCEED
ON HIS JOURNEY TO TOWN.



CHAPTER 50


AFTER A PROPER RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF MRS. FERRARS,
JUST SO VIOLENT AND SO STEADY AS TO PRESERVE HER FROM THAT
REPROACH WHICH SHE ALWAYS SEEMED FEARFUL OF INCURRING,
THE REPROACH OF BEING TOO AMIABLE, EDWARD WAS ADMITTED
TO HER PRESENCE, AND PRONOUNCED TO BE AGAIN HER SON.

HER FAMILY HAD OF LATE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY FLUCTUATING.
FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE SHE HAD HAD TWO SONS;
BUT THE CRIME AND ANNIHILATION OF EDWARD A FEW WEEKS AGO,
HAD ROBBED HER OF ONE; THE SIMILAR ANNIHILATION OF ROBERT
HAD LEFT HER FOR A FORTNIGHT WITHOUT ANY; AND NOW,
BY THE RESUSCITATION OF EDWARD, SHE HAD ONE AGAIN.

IN SPITE OF HIS BEING ALLOWED ONCE MORE TO LIVE,
HOWEVER, HE DID NOT FEEL THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS EXISTENCE
SECURE, TILL HE HAD REVEALED HIS PRESENT ENGAGEMENT;
FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, HE FEARED,
MIGHT GIVE A SUDDEN TURN TO HIS CONSTITUTION, AND CARRY
HIM OFF AS RAPIDLY AS BEFORE.  WITH APPREHENSIVE CAUTION
THEREFORE IT WAS REVEALED, AND HE WAS LISTENED TO WITH
UNEXPECTED CALMNESS.  MRS. FERRARS AT FIRST REASONABLY
ENDEAVOURED TO DISSUADE HIM FROM MARRYING MISS DASHWOOD,
BY EVERY ARGUMENT IN HER POWER;--TOLD HIM, THAT IN MISS MORTON
HE WOULD HAVE A WOMAN OF HIGHER RANK AND LARGER FORTUNE;--
AND ENFORCED THE ASSERTION, BY OBSERVING THAT MISS MORTON
WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A NOBLEMAN WITH THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS,
WHILE MISS DASHWOOD WAS ONLY THE DAUGHTER OF A PRIVATE
GENTLEMAN WITH NO MORE THAN THREE; BUT WHEN SHE FOUND THAT,
THOUGH PERFECTLY ADMITTING THE TRUTH OF HER REPRESENTATION,
HE WAS BY NO MEANS INCLINED TO BE GUIDED BY IT,
SHE JUDGED IT WISEST, FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST,
TO SUBMIT--AND THEREFORE, AFTER SUCH AN UNGRACIOUS DELAY
AS SHE OWED TO HER OWN DIGNITY, AND AS SERVED TO PREVENT
EVERY SUSPICION OF GOOD-WILL, SHE ISSUED HER DECREE
OF CONSENT TO THE MARRIAGE OF EDWARD AND ELINOR.

WHAT SHE WOULD ENGAGE TO DO TOWARDS AUGMENTING
THEIR INCOME WAS NEXT TO BE CONSIDERED; AND HERE IT
PLAINLY APPEARED, THAT THOUGH EDWARD WAS NOW HER ONLY SON,
HE WAS BY NO MEANS HER ELDEST; FOR WHILE ROBERT WAS
INEVITABLY ENDOWED WITH A THOUSAND POUNDS A-YEAR,
NOT THE SMALLEST OBJECTION WAS MADE AGAINST EDWARD'S TAKING
ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY AT THE UTMOST;
NOR WAS ANYTHING PROMISED EITHER FOR THE PRESENT OR IN FUTURE,
BEYOND THE TEN THOUSAND POUNDS, WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN WITH FANNY.

IT WAS AS MUCH, HOWEVER, AS WAS DESIRED,
AND MORE THAN WAS EXPECTED, BY EDWARD AND ELINOR;
AND MRS. FERRARS HERSELF, BY HER SHUFFLING EXCUSES,
SEEMED THE ONLY PERSON SURPRISED AT HER NOT GIVING MORE.

WITH AN INCOME QUITE SUFFICIENT TO THEIR WANTS
THUS SECURED TO THEM, THEY HAD NOTHING TO WAIT FOR
AFTER EDWARD WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE LIVING, BUT THE
READINESS OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH COLONEL BRANDON,
WITH AN EAGER DESIRE FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ELINOR,
WAS MAKING CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENTS; AND AFTER WAITING
SOME TIME FOR THEIR COMPLETION, AFTER EXPERIENCING,
AS USUAL, A THOUSAND DISAPPOINTMENTS AND DELAYS
FROM THE UNACCOUNTABLE DILATORINESS OF THE WORKMEN, ELINOR,
AS USUAL, BROKE THROUGH THE FIRST POSITIVE RESOLUTION
OF NOT MARRYING TILL EVERY THING WAS READY, AND THE
CEREMONY TOOK PLACE IN BARTON CHURCH EARLY IN THE AUTUMN.

THE FIRST MONTH AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE WAS SPENT
WITH THEIR FRIEND AT THE MANSION-HOUSE; FROM WHENCE
THEY COULD SUPERINTEND THE PROGRESS OF THE PARSONAGE,
AND DIRECT EVERY THING AS THEY LIKED ON THE SPOT;--
COULD CHUSE PAPERS, PROJECT SHRUBBERIES, AND INVENT A SWEEP.
MRS. JENNINGS'S PROPHECIES, THOUGH RATHER JUMBLED TOGETHER,
WERE CHIEFLY FULFILLED; FOR SHE WAS ABLE TO VISIT EDWARD
AND HIS WIFE IN THEIR PARSONAGE BY MICHAELMAS, AND SHE
FOUND IN ELINOR AND HER HUSBAND, AS SHE REALLY BELIEVED,
ONE OF THE HAPPIEST COUPLES IN THE WORLD.  THEY HAD
IN FACT NOTHING TO WISH FOR, BUT THE MARRIAGE OF COLONEL
BRANDON AND MARIANNE, AND RATHER BETTER PASTURAGE FOR
THEIR COWS.

THEY WERE VISITED ON THEIR FIRST SETTLING BY ALMOST
ALL THEIR RELATIONS AND FRIENDS.  MRS. FERRARS CAME
TO INSPECT THE HAPPINESS WHICH SHE WAS ALMOST ASHAMED
OF HAVING AUTHORISED; AND EVEN THE DASHWOODS WERE AT
THE EXPENSE OF A JOURNEY FROM SUSSEX TO DO THEM HONOUR.

"I WILL NOT SAY THAT I AM DISAPPOINTED, MY DEAR SISTER,"
SAID JOHN, AS THEY WERE WALKING TOGETHER ONE MORNING BEFORE
THE GATES OF DELAFORD HOUSE, "THAT WOULD BE SAYING TOO MUCH,
FOR CERTAINLY YOU HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MOST FORTUNATE YOUNG
WOMEN IN THE WORLD, AS IT IS.  BUT, I CONFESS, IT WOULD
GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE TO CALL COLONEL BRANDON BROTHER.
HIS PROPERTY HERE, HIS PLACE, HIS HOUSE, EVERY THING IS IN
SUCH RESPECTABLE AND EXCELLENT CONDITION!--AND HIS WOODS!--I
HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH TIMBER ANY WHERE IN DORSETSHIRE, AS THERE
IS NOW STANDING IN DELAFORD HANGER!--AND THOUGH, PERHAPS,
MARIANNE MAY NOT SEEM EXACTLY THE PERSON TO ATTRACT HIM--
YET I THINK IT WOULD ALTOGETHER BE ADVISABLE FOR YOU TO
HAVE THEM NOW FREQUENTLY STAYING WITH YOU, FOR AS COLONEL
BRANDON SEEMS A GREAT DEAL AT HOME, NOBODY CAN TELL WHAT
MAY HAPPEN--FOR, WHEN PEOPLE ARE MUCH THROWN TOGETHER,
AND SEE LITTLE OF ANYBODY ELSE--AND IT WILL ALWAYS BE
IN YOUR POWER TO SET HER OFF TO ADVANTAGE, AND SO FORTH;--
IN SHORT, YOU MAY AS WELL GIVE HER A CHANCE--YOU UNDERSTAND
ME."--

BUT THOUGH MRS. FERRARS DID COME TO SEE THEM, AND ALWAYS
TREATED THEM WITH THE MAKE-BELIEVE OF DECENT AFFECTION,
THEY WERE NEVER INSULTED BY HER REAL FAVOUR AND PREFERENCE.
THAT WAS DUE TO THE FOLLY OF ROBERT, AND THE CUNNING
OF HIS WIFE; AND IT WAS EARNED BY THEM BEFORE MANY MONTHS
HAD PASSED AWAY.  THE SELFISH SAGACITY OF THE LATTER,
WHICH HAD AT FIRST DRAWN ROBERT INTO THE SCRAPE,
WAS THE PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENT OF HIS DELIVERANCE FROM IT;
FOR HER RESPECTFUL HUMILITY, ASSIDUOUS ATTENTIONS,
AND ENDLESS FLATTERIES, AS SOON AS THE SMALLEST OPENING
WAS GIVEN FOR THEIR EXERCISE, RECONCILED MRS. FERRARS
TO HIS CHOICE, AND RE-ESTABLISHED HIM COMPLETELY IN
HER FAVOUR.

THE WHOLE OF LUCY'S BEHAVIOUR IN THE AFFAIR,
AND THE PROSPERITY WHICH CROWNED IT, THEREFORE, MAY BE HELD
FORTH AS A MOST ENCOURAGING INSTANCE OF WHAT AN EARNEST,
AN UNCEASING ATTENTION TO SELF-INTEREST, HOWEVER ITS PROGRESS
MAY BE APPARENTLY OBSTRUCTED, WILL DO IN SECURING EVERY
ADVANTAGE OF FORTUNE, WITH NO OTHER SACRIFICE THAN THAT OF TIME
AND CONSCIENCE.  WHEN ROBERT FIRST SOUGHT HER ACQUAINTANCE,
AND PRIVATELY VISITED HER IN BARTLETT'S BUILDINGS,
IT WAS ONLY WITH THE VIEW IMPUTED TO HIM BY HIS BROTHER.
HE MERELY MEANT TO PERSUADE HER TO GIVE UP THE ENGAGEMENT;
AND AS THERE COULD BE NOTHING TO OVERCOME BUT THE AFFECTION
OF BOTH, HE NATURALLY EXPECTED THAT ONE OR TWO INTERVIEWS
WOULD SETTLE THE MATTER.  IN THAT POINT, HOWEVER,
AND THAT ONLY, HE ERRED;--FOR THOUGH LUCY SOON GAVE HIM
HOPES THAT HIS ELOQUENCE WOULD CONVINCE HER IN TIME,
ANOTHER VISIT, ANOTHER CONVERSATION, WAS ALWAYS WANTED
TO PRODUCE THIS CONVICTION.  SOME DOUBTS ALWAYS LINGERED
IN HER MIND WHEN THEY PARTED, WHICH COULD ONLY BE
REMOVED BY ANOTHER HALF HOUR'S DISCOURSE WITH HIMSELF.
HIS ATTENDANCE WAS BY THIS MEANS SECURED, AND THE REST
FOLLOWED IN COURSE.  INSTEAD OF TALKING OF EDWARD,
THEY CAME GRADUALLY TO TALK ONLY OF ROBERT,--A SUBJECT
ON WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS MORE TO SAY THAN ON ANY OTHER,
AND IN WHICH SHE SOON BETRAYED AN INTEREST EVEN EQUAL
TO HIS OWN; AND IN SHORT, IT BECAME SPEEDILY EVIDENT
TO BOTH, THAT HE HAD ENTIRELY SUPPLANTED HIS BROTHER.
HE WAS PROUD OF HIS CONQUEST, PROUD OF TRICKING EDWARD,
AND VERY PROUD OF MARRYING PRIVATELY WITHOUT HIS
MOTHER'S CONSENT.  WHAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IS KNOWN.
THEY PASSED SOME MONTHS IN GREAT HAPPINESS AT DAWLISH;
FOR SHE HAD MANY RELATIONS AND OLD ACQUAINTANCES TO
CUT--AND HE DREW SEVERAL PLANS FOR MAGNIFICENT COTTAGES;--
AND FROM THENCE RETURNING TO TOWN, PROCURED THE FORGIVENESS
OF MRS. FERRARS, BY THE SIMPLE EXPEDIENT OF ASKING IT,
WHICH, AT LUCY'S INSTIGATION, WAS ADOPTED.  THE FORGIVENESS,
AT FIRST, INDEED, AS WAS REASONABLE, COMPREHENDED ONLY ROBERT;
AND LUCY, WHO HAD OWED HIS MOTHER NO DUTY AND THEREFORE
COULD HAVE TRANSGRESSED NONE, STILL REMAINED SOME WEEKS
LONGER UNPARDONED.  BUT PERSEVERANCE IN HUMILITY OF CONDUCT
AND MESSAGES, IN SELF-CONDEMNATION FOR ROBERT'S OFFENCE,
AND GRATITUDE FOR THE UNKINDNESS SHE WAS TREATED WITH,
PROCURED HER IN TIME THE HAUGHTY NOTICE WHICH OVERCAME
HER BY ITS GRACIOUSNESS, AND LED SOON AFTERWARDS, BY RAPID
DEGREES, TO THE HIGHEST STATE OF AFFECTION AND INFLUENCE.
LUCY BECAME AS NECESSARY TO MRS. FERRARS, AS EITHER ROBERT
OR FANNY; AND WHILE EDWARD WAS NEVER CORDIALLY FORGIVEN
FOR HAVING ONCE INTENDED TO MARRY HER, AND ELINOR,
THOUGH SUPERIOR TO HER IN FORTUNE AND BIRTH, WAS SPOKEN
OF AS AN INTRUDER, SHE WAS IN EVERY THING CONSIDERED,
AND ALWAYS OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGED, TO BE A FAVOURITE CHILD.
THEY SETTLED IN TOWN, RECEIVED VERY LIBERAL ASSISTANCE
FROM MRS. FERRARS, WERE ON THE BEST TERMS IMAGINABLE
WITH THE DASHWOODS; AND SETTING ASIDE THE JEALOUSIES
AND ILL-WILL CONTINUALLY SUBSISTING BETWEEN FANNY AND LUCY,
IN WHICH THEIR HUSBANDS OF COURSE TOOK A PART, AS WELL
AS THE FREQUENT DOMESTIC DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN ROBERT AND
LUCY THEMSELVES, NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE HARMONY IN WHICH
THEY ALL LIVED TOGETHER.

WHAT EDWARD HAD DONE TO FORFEIT THE RIGHT OF ELDEST
SON, MIGHT HAVE PUZZLED MANY PEOPLE TO FIND OUT; AND WHAT
ROBERT HAD DONE TO SUCCEED TO IT, MIGHT HAVE PUZZLED THEM
STILL MORE.  IT WAS AN ARRANGEMENT, HOWEVER, JUSTIFIED IN
ITS EFFECTS, IF NOT IN ITS CAUSE; FOR NOTHING EVER
APPEARED IN ROBERT'S STYLE OF LIVING OR OF TALKING TO GIVE
A SUSPICION OF HIS REGRETTING THE EXTENT OF HIS INCOME,
AS EITHER LEAVING HIS BROTHER TOO LITTLE, OR BRINGING
HIMSELF TOO MUCH;--AND IF EDWARD MIGHT BE JUDGED FROM
THE READY DISCHARGE OF HIS DUTIES IN EVERY PARTICULAR,
FROM AN INCREASING ATTACHMENT TO HIS WIFE AND HIS HOME,
AND FROM THE REGULAR CHEERFULNESS OF HIS SPIRITS,
HE MIGHT BE SUPPOSED NO LESS CONTENTED WITH HIS LOT,
NO LESS FREE FROM EVERY WISH OF AN EXCHANGE.

ELINOR'S MARRIAGE DIVIDED HER AS LITTLE FROM HER
FAMILY AS COULD WELL BE CONTRIVED, WITHOUT RENDERING
THE COTTAGE AT BARTON ENTIRELY USELESS, FOR HER MOTHER
AND SISTERS SPENT MUCH MORE THAN HALF THEIR TIME WITH HER.
MRS. DASHWOOD WAS ACTING ON MOTIVES OF POLICY AS WELL
AS PLEASURE IN THE FREQUENCY OF HER VISITS AT DELAFORD;
FOR HER WISH OF BRINGING MARIANNE AND COLONEL BRANDON TOGETHER
WAS HARDLY LESS EARNEST, THOUGH RATHER MORE LIBERAL THAN
WHAT JOHN HAD EXPRESSED.  IT WAS NOW HER DARLING OBJECT.
PRECIOUS AS WAS THE COMPANY OF HER DAUGHTER TO HER,
SHE DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO GIVE UP ITS CONSTANT
ENJOYMENT TO HER VALUED FRIEND; AND TO SEE MARIANNE SETTLED AT
THE MANSION-HOUSE WAS EQUALLY THE WISH OF EDWARD AND ELINOR.
THEY EACH FELT HIS SORROWS, AND THEIR OWN OBLIGATIONS,
AND MARIANNE, BY GENERAL CONSENT, WAS TO BE THE REWARD
OF ALL.

WITH SUCH A CONFEDERACY AGAINST HER--WITH A KNOWLEDGE
SO INTIMATE OF HIS GOODNESS--WITH A CONVICTION OF HIS FOND
ATTACHMENT TO HERSELF, WHICH AT LAST, THOUGH LONG AFTER IT
WAS OBSERVABLE TO EVERYBODY ELSE--BURST ON HER--WHAT COULD SHE
DO?

MARIANNE DASHWOOD WAS BORN TO AN EXTRAORDINARY FATE.
SHE WAS BORN TO DISCOVER THE FALSEHOOD OF HER OWN OPINIONS,
AND TO COUNTERACT, BY HER CONDUCT, HER MOST FAVOURITE MAXIMS.
SHE WAS BORN TO OVERCOME AN AFFECTION FORMED SO LATE
IN LIFE AS AT SEVENTEEN, AND WITH NO SENTIMENT
SUPERIOR TO STRONG ESTEEM AND LIVELY FRIENDSHIP,
VOLUNTARILY TO GIVE HER HAND TO ANOTHER!--AND THAT OTHER,
A MAN WHO HAD SUFFERED NO LESS THAN HERSELF UNDER THE
EVENT OF A FORMER ATTACHMENT, WHOM, TWO YEARS BEFORE,
SHE HAD CONSIDERED TOO OLD TO BE MARRIED,--AND WHO STILL
SOUGHT THE CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARD OF A FLANNEL WAISTCOAT!

BUT SO IT WAS.  INSTEAD OF FALLING A SACRIFICE
TO AN IRRESISTIBLE PASSION, AS ONCE SHE HAD FONDLY
FLATTERED HERSELF WITH EXPECTING,--INSTEAD OF REMAINING
EVEN FOR EVER WITH HER MOTHER, AND FINDING HER ONLY
PLEASURES IN RETIREMENT AND STUDY, AS AFTERWARDS IN HER
MORE CALM AND SOBER JUDGMENT SHE HAD DETERMINED ON,--
SHE FOUND HERSELF AT NINETEEN, SUBMITTING TO NEW ATTACHMENTS,
ENTERING ON NEW DUTIES, PLACED IN A NEW HOME, A WIFE,
THE MISTRESS OF A FAMILY, AND THE PATRONESS OF A VILLAGE.

COLONEL BRANDON WAS NOW AS HAPPY, AS ALL THOSE WHO BEST
LOVED HIM, BELIEVED HE DESERVED TO BE;--IN MARIANNE HE
WAS CONSOLED FOR EVERY PAST AFFLICTION;--HER REGARD AND HER
SOCIETY RESTORED HIS MIND TO ANIMATION, AND HIS SPIRITS
TO CHEERFULNESS; AND THAT MARIANNE FOUND HER OWN HAPPINESS
IN FORMING HIS, WAS EQUALLY THE PERSUASION AND DELIGHT
OF EACH OBSERVING FRIEND.  MARIANNE COULD NEVER LOVE
BY HALVES; AND HER WHOLE HEART BECAME, IN TIME, AS MUCH
DEVOTED TO HER HUSBAND, AS IT HAD ONCE BEEN TO WILLOUGHBY.

WILLOUGHBY COULD NOT HEAR OF HER MARRIAGE WITHOUT
A PANG; AND HIS PUNISHMENT WAS SOON AFTERWARDS COMPLETE
IN THE VOLUNTARY FORGIVENESS OF MRS. SMITH, WHO, BY STATING
HIS MARRIAGE WITH A WOMAN OF CHARACTER, AS THE SOURCE
OF HER CLEMENCY, GAVE HIM REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT HAD HE
BEHAVED WITH HONOUR TOWARDS MARIANNE, HE MIGHT AT ONCE HAVE
BEEN HAPPY AND RICH.  THAT HIS REPENTANCE OF MISCONDUCT,
WHICH THUS BROUGHT ITS OWN PUNISHMENT, WAS SINCERE,
NEED NOT BE DOUBTED;--NOR THAT HE LONG THOUGHT OF COLONEL
BRANDON WITH ENVY, AND OF MARIANNE WITH REGRET.  BUT THAT
HE WAS FOR EVER INCONSOLABLE, THAT HE FLED FROM SOCIETY,
OR CONTRACTED AN HABITUAL GLOOM OF TEMPER, OR DIED OF A
BROKEN HEART, MUST NOT BE DEPENDED ON--FOR HE DID NEITHER.
HE LIVED TO EXERT, AND FREQUENTLY TO ENJOY HIMSELF.
HIS WIFE WAS NOT ALWAYS OUT OF HUMOUR, NOR HIS HOME
ALWAYS UNCOMFORTABLE; AND IN HIS BREED OF HORSES AND DOGS,
AND IN SPORTING OF EVERY KIND, HE FOUND NO INCONSIDERABLE
DEGREE OF DOMESTIC FELICITY.

FOR MARIANNE, HOWEVER--IN SPITE OF HIS INCIVILITY
IN SURVIVING HER LOSS--HE ALWAYS RETAINED THAT DECIDED
REGARD WHICH INTERESTED HIM IN EVERY THING THAT BEFELL HER,
AND MADE HER HIS SECRET STANDARD OF PERFECTION IN WOMAN;--
AND MANY A RISING BEAUTY WOULD BE SLIGHTED BY HIM IN
AFTER-DAYS AS BEARING NO COMPARISON WITH MRS. BRANDON.

MRS. DASHWOOD WAS PRUDENT ENOUGH TO REMAIN AT THE COTTAGE,
WITHOUT ATTEMPTING A REMOVAL TO DELAFORD; AND FORTUNATELY FOR
SIR JOHN AND MRS. JENNINGS, WHEN MARIANNE WAS TAKEN FROM THEM,
MARGARET HAD REACHED AN AGE HIGHLY SUITABLE FOR DANCING,
AND NOT VERY INELIGIBLE FOR BEING SUPPOSED TO HAVE A LOVER.

BETWEEN BARTON AND DELAFORD, THERE WAS THAT CONSTANT
COMMUNICATION WHICH STRONG FAMILY AFFECTION WOULD
NATURALLY DICTATE;--AND AMONG THE MERITS AND THE HAPPINESS
OF ELINOR AND MARIANNE, LET IT NOT BE RANKED AS THE LEAST
CONSIDERABLE, THAT THOUGH SISTERS, AND LIVING ALMOST WITHIN
SIGHT OF EACH OTHER, THEY COULD LIVE WITHOUT DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN THEMSELVES, OR PRODUCING COOLNESS BETWEEN THEIR HUSBANDS.

THE END
